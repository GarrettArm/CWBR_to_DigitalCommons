<p>
My dear General Banks</p>
<p>
Being a poor correspondent is the only apology I offer for not having sooner tendered my thanks for your very successful, and very valuable military operations this year. The final stroke in opening the Mississippi<sup>1</sup> never should, and I think never will, be forgotten.</p>
<p>
Recent events in Mexico, I think, render early action in Texas<sup>2</sup> more important than ever. I expect, however, the General-in-Chief, will address you more fully upon this subject.</p>
<p>
Governor Boutwell<sup>3</sup> read me to-day that part of your letter to him, which relates to Louisiana affairs. While I very well know what I would be glad for Louisiana to do, it is quite a different thing for me to assume direction of the matter. I would be glad for her to make a new Constitution recognizing the Emancipation proclamation, and adopting Emancipation in those parts of the state to which the proclamation does not apply. And while she is at it, I think it would not be objectionable for her to adopt some practical system by which the two races could gradually live themselves out of their old relation to each other, and both come out better prepared for the new. Education for young blacks should be included in the plan. After all, the power, or element, of ""contract"" may be sufficient for this probationary period; and, by it’s simplicity, and flexibility, may be the better.</p>
<p> 
As an Anti-Slavery man I have a motive to desire emancipation, which pro-slavery men do not have; but even they have strong Enough reason to thus place themselves again under the shield of the Union; and to thus perpetually hedge against the recurrence of the scenes through which we are now passing.</p>
<p>
Gov. Shepley<sup>4</sup> has informed me that Mr. Durant<sup>5</sup> is now taking a registry, with a view to the Election of a Constitutional Convention in Louisiana. This, to me, appears proper. If such convention were to ask my views, I could present little else than what I now say to you. I think the thing should be pushed forward, so that if possible, its mature work may reach here by the meeting of Congress.</p>
<p>
For my own part I think I shall not, in any event, retract the Emancipation proclamation; nor, as Executive, ever return to slavery any person who is free by the terms of that proclamation, or by any of the acts of Congress.</p>
<p>
If Louisiana shall send members to Congress, their admission to seats will depend, as you know, upon the respective Houses, and not upon the President.</p>
<p>
If these views can be of any advantage in giving shape, and impetus, to action there, I shall be glad for you to use them prudently for that object. Of course you will confer with intelligent and trusty citizens of the State, among whom I would suggest Messrs. Flanders<sup>6</sup>, Hahn<sup>7</sup>, and Durant; and to each of whom I now think I may send copies of this letter. Still it is perhaps better to not make the letter generally public. Yours very truly</p>
<p>

Louis Bringier papers, Mss. 43, 139, 544, Louisiana and Lower Mississippi Valley Collections</p>
<p>
Among the papers of Louis Bringier<sup>1</sup>, a Louisiana planter (Hermitage Plantation) who served in the Confederacy, one can find a handwritten copy of “Report of the Battle of Manassa” [<i>sic</i>] by Confederate General Pierre Gustave Toutant (P. G. T.) Beauregard. In this letter to General S. Cooper, Adjutant Inspector General, the general describes his proposed strategy at First Manassas, which, as he notes, was rejected by his superiors. This post-battle report, along with additional details, was ultimately published in the <i>Official Records of the War of the Rebellion</i>, Series 1, Volume 2 (pp. 484-504). The handwritten copy is undated, but the <i>OR</i> shows the date “August 26 [October 14], 1861.”</p>
<p>

<p>
<blockquote><p>
Report of the Battle of Manassa</p>
<p>G. T. Beauregard, Genl Comdg 1st Corps<br>
Army of the Potomac</p>
<p>To<br>
Genl S. Cooper<sup>2</sup> – Adjt Insp Genl<br>
Richmond, Va</p>
<p>General<br>
Before entering upon a narrative of the general military operations in the presence of the enemy on the 21st of July, I propose, I hope not unseasonably, first to recite certain events, which belong to the strategy of the campaign, and consequently form an essential part of the history of the Battle. </p>
<p>
Having become satisfied that the advance of the enemy, with a decidedly superior force, both as to numbers and war equipage, to attack or turn my position in this quarter, was immediately impending, I dispatched on the 13th of July one of my staff, Colonel James Chestnut, of South Carolina, to submit for the consideration of the President, a plan of operations, substantially as follows: </p>
<p>
I proposed that Genl Johnston should unite as soon as possible, the bulk of the Army of the Shenandoah with that of the Potomac, then under my command, leaving only sufficient forces to garrison his strong works at Winchester, and to guard the fine defensive passes of the Blue Ridge, and thus hold Patterson in check. At the same time Brig. Genl Holmes<sup>3</sup>was to march hither with all of his command not essential for the defense of the position of Aquia Creek<sup>4</sup>. These junctions having been effected at Manassas, an immediate impetuous attack of our combined armies upon Genl McDowell<sup>5</sup> was to follow, as soon as he approached my advanced positions at, and around Fairfax C.H.<sup>6</sup>, with the inevitable result, as I submitted, of his complete defeat, and the destruction or capture of his army. This accomplished, the Army of the Shenandoah, under Genl Johnston<sup>7</sup>, increased with a part of my forces, and rejoined as he returned by the detachments left to hold the mountain passes, was to march back rapidly into the Valley, fall upon and crush Patterson<sup>8</sup>, with a superior force wheresoever he might be found. This I confidently estimated, could be achieved within fifteen days after Genl Johnston should march from Winchester for Manassa.  Meanwhile, I was to occupy the enemy's works, on this side of the Potomac if, as I anticipated, he had been so routed as to enable me to enter them with him; or if not, to retire again for a time within the lines of Bull Run with my main force. Patterson having been virtually destroyed, then Genl Johnston would reinforce Genl  Garnett<sup>9</sup> sufficiently to make him superior to his opponent, Genl McClellan<sup>10</sup>, and able to defeat that officer. This done, Genl Garnett was to form an immediate junction with Genl Johnston, who was forthwith to cross the Potomac into Maryland with his whole force, arouse the people as he advanced the recovery of their political rights and the defence [<i>sic</i>] of their homes and families from an offensive invader, and then march to the investment of Washington in the rear, whilst I resumed the offensive in front. This plan of operations, you are aware, was not accepted at the time, from considerations which appeared so weighty as to more than counterbalance its proposed advantages. </p>
<p>
Informed of these views, and of the decision of the War Department, I then made my preparations for the stoutest practicable defence of the line of Bull Run, the enemy having now developed his purposes by the advance on and occupation of Fairfax C. H., from which my advanced brigade had been withdrawn.</p>

<p>
Regardless of the derailing of Beauregard’s original plans, Southern forces ultimately won the battle, dashing Northern hopes for a quick end to secession and war. Louisiana’s Creole Confederate went on to achieve mythical status, in spite of the controversy surrounding him in his post-war years with the RR<sup>11</sup> and the infamous Louisiana Lottery Company.

4311			CIVIL WAR TREASURES: <br> Binding Contracts: Papers illustrate tenuous relationship between former slaves and masters		Jewett, Leah Wood			"<h3> Binding Contracts </h3><br>
<h3> Papers illustrate tenuous relationship between former slaves and masters </h3>
<p>
Even before the war’s end, laborers only recently enslaved entered into contracts with planters to their mutual, though unbalanced, benefit. Regulations set forth by the federal Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands in 1865, based somewhat on General Nathaniel Banks’s military labor policies of 1864 (General Order 23), dictated the basic terms of the tenuous alliance between former slave and master. As the war ended and the fledgling free labor system was put into practice, all parties sought to negotiate terms in their own favor, with mixed results. The tug of war that ensued reflected the larger struggle between Congress and President Andrew Johnson on the status of freedmen and former Confederates with property (Rodrigue 2001: 61-62).</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Standard issue contracts distributed for signature by the Bureau in early 1865 (before surrender) made provisions for worker responsibility, but comparatively speaking leaned in the laborers’ favor:</p>
<blockquote><p>
 [T] he said parties do hereby mutually agree that the Regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury, providing for the employment and general welfare of Freedmen, Series July 28, 1864, and the local rules in pursuance thereof…The said ___ [employer] for the considerations and on the conditions and stipulations hereinafter mentioned, agrees to pay to the said laborers, the rates of monthly wages agreed upon and as specified opposite their respective names hereto: one half of such wages to be punctually paid during each and every month, reckoning from the day when this contract commences as aforesaid, and the remainder to be paid at the terminations of the contract year. Said ___ [employer] further agrees to furnish to the said laborers and those rightfully dependant on them, free of charge, good and sufficient quarters, a separate tenement for each family, fuel and medical attendance; to see that the premises thus furnished are kept in a good sanitary condition; to allot from the lands of said plantation for garden purposes, to each family, one acre of ground; such allotment to include a reasonable use of tools and animals; to exact only ten hours work per day, and no labor whatever on Sundays; and if any labor in excess of ten hours per day is rendered, the same is to be paid as extra labor, upon such terms as may be agreed upon by the parties hereto; to grant to such laborers one-half of each and every Saturday, to enable them to cultivate the potions of land allotted to them, also, the fourth day of July; to co-operate in the establishment of any school for the education of the children of said laborers; that he will keep on hand, and sell to the laborers at actual costs, on the plantations, a sufficient supply of wholesome food and proper clothing for themselves and their families…</p>
<p>
We, the undersigned, employees on the ___ plantation, belonging to ___ and register by ___ , hereby agree to work as Laborers on said Plantation for the balance of the present year, upon the following terms and conditions:  For the consideration of just treatment, wholesome food, comfortable clothing and quarters, fuel and necessary medical attention, the opportunity for instructing our children, and such other privileges and conditions as are contained in General Order No. 34, Headquarters Department of the Mississippi , March 23, 1865, and the further consideration of the payment to us of ___ . </p>
<p>
[From the Lemuel P. Conner Family Papers, Mss. 1403, Louisiana and Lower Mississippi Valley Collections, LSU Libraries] </p></blockquote>
<p>
In contrast, not surprisingly, contracts written by the planters themselves after the 1865 harvest focus on employer’s expectations and worker’s performance rather than dwelling on provisions made for laborers. An example comes from among the papers of Joseph Embree, a planter in East Feliciana Parish, Louisiana.  Embree had served in Company A, 1st Louisiana Reserves, Confederate Army. After released and paroled from a Union prison in 1865, he returned to Louisiana and resumed planting.  </p>
<blockquote><p>
 “[January 26, 1866]…the said coloured persons … have this day agreed to enter the service of the said Joseph Embree as labourers to work on his farm at any kind of work that he may wish done or preparing land for cultivation or cultivating the soil and growing a crop, fencing or improving land in any way. They agree to be out at and performing the work that the said Joseph Embree or his representative may direct by sun rise where there are no providential hindrences [<i>sic</i>] to prevent and loose no time except at meal times and then consume no unnecessary time in eating except at dinner then they are to have two hours to rest and eat. And when not sick they agree to work faithfully, honestly, diligently and not idle away the time during work hours. They agree to do any work on holidays, Sundays, or nights towards saving crop or anything else that needs immediate attention or feeding any kind of stock that necessarily has to be done, but those performing extra labour must be paid extra as per order of the Freedmens bureau [<i>sic</i>] for this year. They agree to work ten hours in each working day except in winter: viz say from the middle of November to the first of March. Then they agree to work nine hours in each working day and faithfully obey all the reasonable wishes and commands of the said Joseph Embree or his representative for and during the space of one year…</p>
<p>
Each family is to have their portion of land set apart for them and use of farming implements and team on Saturdays after they are through with grinding meal to cultivate their crops and if they or either of them us do not work agreeably to contract they are to leave the place and have no pay …except the victuals and clothes that they may have already received…</p>
<p>
The grade [of pay] to be determined by the work that they perform. The work shall be judged by five persons. Four of the labourers that are the most industrious and competent and the said Joseph Embree…</p>
<p>
The said Joseph Embree shall hire a physitian [<i>sic</i>] if we should need one and deduct his pay for services rendered out of our pay. And for all the time that women or others lose in sickness or nursing children or other personal shall be deducted according to the pay they receive and divided between those that lose the least time…</p>
<p>
[signing by their “mark”] – 
<br>
Dick Embree, Milly Embree, Manuel Hardesty, Sophy Hardesty, Hutson Brown, Kitty Brown, Bob Brown, Ann Brown, Shedrick Brown, Crittenden Embree, Fanny Embree, Mariah Fenley, Daniel Jarald, and Rosy Jarald</p></blockquote>
<p>
Note that several of Embree’s policies would have potentially pitted freedmen against one another (most productive workers would judge the quality of other’s work, and would receive a cut of lost wages) undermining unity and limiting ability of group to work as a group to negotiate.</p>
<p>
“Rules and Regulations on Joseph Embree’s Farm” in large part reiterated what was stipulated in the contract, and were outlined separately:</p>
<blockquote><p>
 “No long or general conversations will be allowed during working hours. …For disobedience one hour will be deducted. Neglect of duty and leaving without permission will be considered disobedience. No live stock will be permitted to be raised by the labourers without a special contract. … Impudence and swearing or indecent and unseemly language to or in the presence of the employer or his family or quarreling and fighting so as to disturb the peace of the farm will be fined two dollars for the first offence…All difficulties that may arise between the labourers shall be adjudge by the employer and if not satisfactory an appeal may be taken to an agent of the United States government.” </p>
<p>
[From the Joseph Embree and Family Papers, Mss. 692, Louisiana and Lower Mississippi Valley Collections, LSU Libraries] </p></blockquote>
<p>
Laborers could delay signing a contract in the midst of planting season, seek employment elsewhere if they did not agree to terms set by the planter during contract negotiation, or could file a complaint with the local bureau agent if they believed that the employer violated the contract in some way. Planters joined together to agree to terms in order to stifle laborers’ new found bargaining tools, pledging not to hire each other’s former workers and setting standard wage levels to discourage labor mobility (Rodrigue 2001: 45-46). </p>
<p>
Ever-changing federal regulations, presidential pardons of landed Confederate loyalists, political activities designed to empower black men (and bolster the Republican Party) and local resistance to freedmen’s programs made the road to freedom a rocky one.  Primary sources on the subject, such as those housed in the Louisiana and Lower Mississippi Valley Collections (LLMVC), shed light on the personal experiences of individuals living through this time of great change and turmoil.</p>
<p>
One unusual example comes from the John W. Gurley Papers, Mss. 507. John W. Gurley, an attorney of New Orleans, Louisiana, was associated with Edward G. Stewart, a planter of Oak Lawn Plantation, Tangipahoa Parish. The collection features several letters written on behalf of Charles Daggs, an African American farmer (presumably a freedman) who works for Gurley.</p>
<p>
In a letter dated April 10, 1866, Stewart writes to Gurley:</p>
<blockquote><p>
 “Chas. [sic] is fully satisfied that he cannot occupy McGuires place without breaking his contract with you, has told McG [sic] so and given up the idea altogether…Charles wishes to say that…his object in moving his family was to give yours more room and was not intended to interfere with your arrangement with him. McG [sic] is a dirty scoundrel who has been trying for months past to induce him to leave is there no law to reach him?”</p></blockquote>
It is apparent that Stewart wrote several letters to Gurley on Charles’ behalf (in several letters Stewart indicates to Gurley that he has read Gurley’s letters to Daggs).  Daggs often describes the status of work on the property and makes specific requests for supplies, seeds and plants, and food for his family. The letter dated April 22, 1866, Daggs argues with Gurley, defending an earlier request:
<blockquote><p>
 “I received your letter chastising me about the corn. I do not think you know how much it takes to feed a family like mine;  when we was on the plantation they allowed us a peck a piece for large persons and a half a peck each for the children a week. I have seven that can eat a peck a week and four that can eat a half, a peck a week and then two dogs and two cats, 140 head of chickens old and young, three goats, four hogs to take their share of the hominy and husk that I can’t use and the toll to come out, I am surprised myself, to hear you say you were surprised. You are mistaken about the quantity of meal the corn makes; if I send a bushel to corn to mill I only get back a bushel of meal, it takes two bushels and a peck to serve my family a week and that is about the average contents of a sack. I would be very glad if you please to hurry up the car, something that I need very much that I can’t work without, my plow is totally worn out at the end and I have to get it pointed and my rake and everything is in bad order…”</p></blockquote>
<p>
 Though most documents in the collections are written from the perspective of the federal government and planters, rather than from the view point of the freedmen, they are nonetheless valuable in fleshing out the experience of those who struggled to make the transition from slavery to freedom against fierce resistance. The lack of documents written in the hand of freedmen is in large part a reflection of widespread illiteracy – a hallmark of the peculiar institution— underscoring the uphill battle that lay ahead for people seeking to gain political power.</p>

<p>
The political clubs served to mobilize freedmen, and in many cases directly influenced freedmen's contract negotiations with planters.

4480	97808078331622	$30.00	A LOOK AT LINCOLN: <br> Lincoln’s Proclamation: Emancipation Reconsidered		Blair, William A. (ed.)	Younger, Karen Fisher (ed.)		"<h3>The Question of Lincoln and Emancipation Reassessed</h3><br>

<p></p>
<p>
Abraham Lincoln patiently indicated to Senator Charles Sumner, who urged emancipation immediately after Fort Sumter fell, that emancipation would be unconstitutional because, because presidents possessed no constitutional power to overturn any state’s slavery statutes merely by proclamation.  And such a proclamation would say or do nothing about what to do with the freed slaves the day afterward or what legal consequences might be if slaveholders challenged an emancipation decree in a federal court system with the ill-famed Chief Justice Roger Taney, famous for his decision in <i>Dred Scott</i>, still at its head.</p>
<p>
When the commandant of the Department of Missouri, John Charles Fremont, issued his own emancipation decree in late 1861, based on the power of martial law, Lincoln revoked it, later relieving Fremont of command.</p>
<p>
There was no jurisprudence in American law that established what the martial-law powers of generals or presidents were, and emancipation did not look like the issue with which to begin that determination.  “Can it be pretended that it is any longer the government of the U.S. . . . Wherein a General, or a President, may make permanent rules of property by proclamation?” Lincoln asked after canceling Fremont’s proclamation.  “No doubt the thing was popular in some quarters,” he admitted, “but Kentucky would be turned against us,” and “to lose Kentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game.”  So, was Abraham Lincoln in conflict with his own view of the Constitution and restraints of executive power when he moved against slavery more forcefully in mid-summer 1862 when the border states had rejected his offer of financial compensation in return for gradual emancipation?  The idea of compensated emancipation received strong approval in the New York press, at least the emancipation part did.  To Henry J. Raymond, publisher of <i>The New York Times</i>, Lincoln wrote privately, “I am grateful to the New York journals and not less so to the <i>Times</i> than to others, for their kind notices of the late special message to Congress,” asking for another article in the <i>Times</i>, which had said compensated emancipation would be too expensive (the talk was of $400 for each slave).</p>
<p>
On March 7, 1862, the <i>New York Tribune</i> wrote about Lincoln’s message to Congress seeking compensation that, “Even if it were no more than a barren avowal by the Chief Magistrate of the Nation, That It Is Highly Desirable That The Union Be Purged Of Slavery.”</p>
<p>
Horace Greeley’s <i>Tribune</i>, in the forefront of the fight to abolish slavery, found much good in the President’s message and took to task Bennett’s <i>Herald</i> and Raymond’s <i>Times</i> for failure of enthusiasm.</p>
<p>
In September he announced his intention of proclaiming emancipation on January 1, 1863.  This was a courageous and radical step.  It made the destruction of slavery a certain consequence of northern victory and confronted the nation with the eventual yet challenging prospect of assimilating a vast population of black people.  In the meantime, slaves within the Union lines could be conscripted into the Federal army and, with guns in their hands, fight to secure their freedom and help to save the Union.  Other aspects of Lincoln’s initiative were seemingly less bold, however.  The proclamation applied only to the slaves currently located inside the Confederacy.  Some say that, in practice, it freed no slaves at all.  I do not think this is true.  As Union forces continued to occupy Confederate territory, they freed slaves.  And many escaped to Union lines. In any event, emancipation would not be officially achieved until the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865, a move that Lincoln supported assiduously.  Some also argue that the tenor of Lincoln’s announcement was rather grudging.  He did not grandly proclaim liberation.  Rather, he indicated that he was embarking upon it primarily out of military necessity.  But he needed a legal rationale for issuing the executive order as slavery was still protected under the Constitution.  And slaves were property, the valuation of each slave placed next to their names in the tax assessors’ books.  And could not property of an enemy be seized under military necessity in war?</p>
<p>
The revolutionary implications of the decision for emancipation were, in effect, tempered by the cautious manner of its execution.  Similarly mixed was the experience of emancipation by the slaves themselves.  After the exhilaration of the first months of liberation, the former slaves soon discovered that their freedom was to be severely limited.  Gains were made, but frequently they turned out to be more fleeting and insubstantial than had been hoped.  The freedmen must therefore have wondered, as have historians ever since, how radical and transforming emancipation really was.</p>
<p>
<i>Lincoln’s Proclamation: Emancipation Reconsidered</i>, representing presentations delivered at a Penn State University symposium in April 2007, admiringly move beyond this context and Professor Richard Hofstadter’s less than charitable description of the document as having “all the moral grandeur of a bill of lading.”</p>
<p>
In the first essay, “Lincoln and the Preconditions for Emancipation,” Paul Finkelman sets the tone, placing the proclamation in context by pointing out the brilliance Lincoln’s strategy in the steps leading to the issuance of the documents.</p>
<p>
Mark E. Neely, Jr. in “Colonization and the Myth That Lincoln Prepared the People for Emancipation,” next discusses the “myth” of colonization as advocated by Lincoln.  To the author, a policy of colonization would not have helped Lincoln politically.  He believed in colonization when many Americans did not.  Neely disputes the view that Lincoln’s offer of exporting freed slaves was intended, in part, to make his emancipation policy more acceptable to conservatives because Lincoln genuinely believed in the exportation of blacks – at least for a time.  What is important here is that trying to compartmentalize Lincoln’s feelings on race is more complex than viewing his beliefs as racist or not.  Lincoln had contradictory views on race that changed from time to time.</p>
<p>
Richard Carwardine discusses the President’s meeting with Chicago ministers who urged Lincoln to issue an emancipation proclamation.  While many view the meeting as making little impression on Lincoln, Carwardine raises valid issues for re-evaluating the meeting and how it made Lincoln focus more on the religious community in general.  This was one of the ways in which Lincoln was able to discern popular opinion.  The President was a master at keeping himself in tune with what the public – his constituents – were thinking.  He did this through discussions with clergy, meeting people during his “public opinion baths” when all were invited into the White House, as well as “intelligence” reports from friends and political allies from all parts of the nation.  In any event, Lincoln, not a member of any church, was sensitive to the religions that predominated in the country.</p>
<p>
In “What Did the Slaves Think About Lincoln?,” Steven H. Hahn demonstrates how the Emancipation Proclamation contributed to the meaning of freedom for African Americans.  Despite illiteracy, freedom contributed to the enslaved’s “political consciousness.”  Slaves also viewed and were sensitive to the moods of their owners as they watched their masters’ reactions to the coming of the war and emancipation.  Owners feared a slave uprising and this fact did not escape the enslaved population either.</p>
<p>
“War, Gender, and Emancipation in the Civil War South” by Stephanie McCurry is a curious presentation because she asks us to consider the question, “How could black women establish citizenship?”  Recognizing that citizenship which was virtually nonexistent for African Americans – even freeborn – could be accomplished only by men through military service.  As to women, it could only be achieved through marriage.  In other words, “…women’s freedom…followed…from the military service of their men” (132).  Like Hahn, McCurry, uses St. Domingue as a way of understanding African Americans’ views on emancipation.</p>
<p>
Probably the most original essay, Michael Vorenberg’s “Abraham Lincoln’s ‘Fellow Citizens’—Before and After Emancipation” gives us a fascinating discussion and understanding of the actual concept of citizenship in the 19th century.  Neither Lincoln’s proclamations nor the Thirteenth Amendment conferred citizenship on slaves who were freed.  And to Vorenberg, Abraham Lincoln was not the leader on pressing for citizenship.  Vorenberg defines a citizen in a most creative way -- legal citizenship, civic citizenship and affective citizenship.  For the first, the person became a citizen by statute or from some court decision.  For civic citizenship, that person was allowed to have certain rights attached to citizenship, e.g., owning property, voting.  And lastly, for affective citizenship, the person had to feel themselves a citizen of the community with a “common language, a common set of concerns, or simply a shared residency” (152).  Vorenberg admits that this last represented members of an “imagined community.”  There is an excellent discussion of the <i>Dred Scott</i> 1857 decision which said that all black persons – free or enslaved – were not legal citizens of either their state or the nation.  Attorney General Edward Bates, in an opinion to Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase, “overruled” this part of <i>Dred Scott</i> when he indicated that a freeborn African-American man piloting a revenue ship was an American citizen.  But the most interesting part of Vorenberg’s discussion was the tardiness of Abraham Lincoln who showed little or no signs of moving toward black citizenship.</p>
<p>
As emancipation was not directed at the border states with slavery intact, the effect on the institution in Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland and Delaware was catatonic.  As African Americans were allowed to enlist in the Union Army and Navy, the institution in these border states began to “unravel as an institution.”  Louis Gertais discusses in “Slaves, Servants, and Soldiers,” how this process came about and the speed – slow at first – in which it became fixed.  He, like McCurry, demonstrates how the quickest way to freedom in the border states was through enlistment in military service.</p>
<p>
One of the editors, William Blair, in “Celebrating Freedom,” explains how we remember the Emancipation Proclamation today.  While Lincoln is appropriately celebrated, there is no commemoration of the end of slavery – one of the greatest events in United States history.  The problem has to do with remembering slavery while commemorating freedom.  To Blair, there are many kinds of “civic” ceremonies and, in our world, we overlook emancipation as part of these traditions and rituals.</p>
<p>
This well-meaning and well-written book gives the reader pause as we wonder whether or not we fully comprehend certain aspects of Abraham Lincoln and emancipation.  There are many layers of understanding, just as there are with the man who issued the documents of freedom.</p>
<p>
These splendid essays demonstrate how much the Emancipation Proclamation was a potent symbol for men and women who had been born in America, but had not been allowed to consider themselves <i>of</i> America.  The reality of the Emancipation Proclamation – its limitations and conservative statements – as shown in this book, is less important than the promise it held for the nearly four million enslaved men and women and the half-million free blacks.  That promise sustained the African-American population for a time, but faded with the onslaught of discrimination and violence that permeated American society in the post-war years and well into the 20th century.</p>
<p>
Finally, this book illustrates that the Emancipation Proclamation’s promise was important to white Americans as well in that it allows them to view the nation both presently and historically as a place where all can enjoy inclusion and share in its liberality.  Thus, too much attention has been given to proving the argument for or against Lincoln as liberator.  Greater focus is needed on what enslaved people and other contemporary Americans believed was and would be the significance of the document itself.  Another essay on the greater assessment of whether or not the document did what was intended would have been welcome here along with a discussion regarding why African Americans, for the most part, have turned away from the “great emancipator” idea.  Only with such focus can the document’s impact on African Americans, and logically, its impact on white America, as well, can we understand the evolving race relations as well as influence our thinking about the nation’s character.</p>
<p>
All in all, though, we underestimate the political courage it took for Abraham Lincoln to issue the Emancipation Proclamation and then stand behind it.  Six weeks after he gave his 100-days’s warning in his preliminary proclamation, the midterm congressional elections dumped 45 Republicans from their seats in the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>
Impliedly, African Americans did many things for themselves to destroy slavery with more than 180,000 who fought in the Union Army and Navy.  But in the end, freedom might have come to nothing without Abraham Lincoln, his Emancipation Proclamation and winning the Civil War.</p>

4565	978-0-8262-1857-5	$44.95	A LOOK AT LINCOLN: <br>Lincoln and the Politics of Christian Love		Havers, Grant N.			"<h3>The Intersection of Christianity and Politics</h3><br>

<p></p>
<p>
In this accessible and well-written book, Grant N. Havers discusses Abraham Lincoln and charity which the Bible calls love.  Although it is pitched for political philosophers, he richly illuminates Christian charity and how it is noticeably absent from today’s debates about religion and democracy.  This is a work of political philosophy that probes profound themes of Lincoln’s political thought and Lincoln’s wider role in the tradition of American political thought.  Along with Joseph R. Fornieri’s <i>Lincoln’s Political Faith</i> (Northern Illinois University Press) and Lucas Morel’s <i>Lincoln’s Sacred Effort (Lexington Books)</i>, this work of political philosophy deals with the controversial yet crucial question of Lincoln’s synthesis of religion and politics.  Havers distinguishes his scholarship from these other works by highlighting the principle of charity in Lincoln’s political thought and action.  The philosophical statesmanship of Abraham Lincoln reflects deeply on this concept of charity that binds and elevates human beings.</p>
<p>
Abraham Lincoln was not some monarch, living in a wholly alien society.  Many of the issues of the mid-19th century – from the role of the federal government in the economy to whether America is a Christian nation – remain issues in the early 21st century.</p>
<p>
In his long career as a Whig and Republican politician, Abraham Lincoln expressed views on many subjects other than unionism and slavery.  Americans are rightly curious about the beliefs and values of the most iconic American president.  Contemporary historians are inclined to deflect such questions by mumbling that Lincoln was “mysterious” or “enigmatic.”  But there is no lack of evidence.  Lincoln’s ideas about race, religion, and the Constitution are well known to scholars.  What Lincoln might think about today’s American politics is not only a legitimate question, but one that can be answered with a reasonable chance of success.  In this provocative book, the author argues that charity is a central tenet of what Lincoln once called America’s “political religion.”  He explores the implications of making Christian love the highest moral standard for American democracy with Lincoln’s legacy demanding that a true democracy be charitable towards all.</p>
<p>
What would Abraham Lincoln think of the religious right in today’s Republican Party – and more to the point, what would the religious right think of him?  According to his law partner, William H. Herndon, in 1834 Lincoln wrote “a little book on infidelity” in which he questioned “the divinity of Christ – Special Inspiration – Revelation, Etc.”  He reluctantly burned it when his friends warned him it would damage his career.  During the same year, the young Whig politician criticized supporters of the Democrat Peter Cartwright, an evangelist turned politician as “in some degree priest-ridden.”  When he ran for Congress in 1846, Lincoln was accused by the religious right of the day of being an infidel.  His reply was a classic of politically motivated equivocation: “That I am not a member of any Christian church is true; but I have never denied the truth of the Scriptures; and I have never spoken with intentional disrespect of religion in general, or any denomination of Christians in particular.”</p>
<p>
Lincoln’s speeches and beliefs were deeply influenced by the King James Bible, and as the course of the Civil War mounted, he dwelled on the mysteries of Providence.  According to his closest associates, however, he never became a Christian.  “He had no faith in the Christian sense of the term – had faith in laws, principles, effects and causes,” observed Judge David Davis, a longtime friend whom Lincoln appointed to the Supreme Court.  His first law partner, John Todd Stewart, wrote, “He was an avowed and open infidel and sometimes bordered on atheism … went further against Christian beliefs and doctrines and principles than any man I ever heard; he shocked me … Lincoln always denied that Jesus was the Christ of God – denied that Jesus was the son of God as understood and maintained by the Christian church.”</p>
<p>
The book is as much a discussion about Lincoln’s political legacy in the American political tradition amongst liberals and various factions of American conservatism.  In particular, the author considers the disputed question over the relationship between reason and revelation in the works of the influential political philosopher Leo Strauss and his students.</p>
<p>
While Lincoln did not believe that Jesus was the son of God, he did believe in, as he stated in his Second Inaugural address, “with charity for all” and for the vision of human equality contained in the Declaration of Independence.</p>
<p>
This work defends Lincoln’s understanding of charity as essential to the hope and vision of the Declaration of Independence while emphasizing the difficulty of fusing this ethic with the desire to spread democracy to people who do not share America’s Christian heritage.<./p>
<p>
Those in our era are aware that there is evil in the world even if we were not in the presence of Hitler and Stalin.  We know that it is necessary to fight that evil.</p>
<p>
At the same time, we have a lingering awareness of the sinfulness within ourselves.  As Cold War strategist George F. Kennan put it, “The fact of the matter is that there is a little bit of the totalitarian buried somewhere, way down deep, in each and every one of us.”  So we as a people should not be carried away by our own righteousness or be seduced by the belief that we are innocent.  As this book points out, even fighting evil can be corrupting.  As Harry Truman said, “We all have to recognize, no matter how great our strength, that we must deny ourselves the license to do always as we please.”</p>
<p>
Many champion the spread of democracy, knowing that democracy is the only system that fits humanity’s noble yet sinful nature.  As the mid-century theologian, Reinhold Niebuhr declared, “Man’s capacity for justice makes democracy possible; but man’s inclination to injustice makes democracy necessary.”</p>
<p>
Abraham Lincoln talked about the need to balance the moral obligation to champion freedom with not getting swept up in self-destructive fervor.  While Abraham Lincoln did not always get this balance right, he understood the difference of a moral foreign policy based on charity rather than the costly idolization of democracy.  As such, <i>Lincoln and the Politics of Christian Love </i> makes a timely contribution to the wider debate over both the meaning of religion in American politics and the mission of America in the world, opening a new window on Lincoln’s lasting legacy.</p>
<p>
Yet, Havers claims that the biblical notions of chosenness and American exceptionalism have been overemphasized in Lincoln’s thought, thereby leading to utopian projects at home and foreign adventures abroad.  Ideologically, he seeks to rescue Lincoln from neo-conservative interpreters who, in his view, have exploited Lincoln’s legacy to justify policies like the invasion of Iraq and the welfare state at home.  He does this by oversimplifying the views of these scholars: American exceptionalism is an important strand of Lincoln’s and American political thought that need not derail into triumphalism, nor does the defense of equality as a principle of justice necessarily commit one to equality of results or the welfare state.</p>
<p>
Notions of Christian charity, or love, strongly shape the political thought of Abraham Lincoln along with other leaders like Thomas Jefferson and Martin Luther King, Jr. who was deeply influenced by Niebuhr.  Havers leads us through how Abraham Lincoln presided over a foundational moment in the development of American democracy, revealing both the problems and possibilities of making it a political ideal.</p>
<p>
Havers argues that, it was Lincoln and his ingenious blend of Puritan and democratic insights who best fulfilled the promise of this nation’s “bonds of affection.”  With his recognition of the imperfections of both North and South, his humility in the face of God’s judgment on the Civil War, and his insistence on “charity for all,” including the defeated Confederacy, as he firmly prosecuted a war in the name of a “new birth of freedom,”  Lincoln personified the possibilities of religious love turned into civic virtue.</p>
<p>
Weaving a rich tapestry of insights from political science and literature and American religious history and political theory, <i>Lincoln and the Politics of Christian Love</i> is a major contribution to the study of American political identity.  Grant N. Havers makes plain that civic charity, while commonly rejected as irrelevant or even harmful to political engagement, has been integral to our national character, even if it is not a panacea for the rest of the world.  Nor should it be, “a quasi-religious mission to spread democracy” which, “may continue to harm the very image and stability of the nation” (182).</p>
<p>
Ultimately, the Civil War was fundamentally a struggle to realize justice, not love.  While at the end of the war Lincoln appealed to charity for all to bind the nation's wounds, we should never forget that justice could only be achieved through war, crucifixion, and suffering of the nation.</p>

4826	978-0-7864-5928-5	$45.00	A LOOK AT LINCOLN: <br>Lincoln and His Word		Miller, Richard Lawrence			"<h3>Examining Lincoln in His Own Perspective</h3><br>

<p></p>
<p>
This, the third volume in Richard Lawrence Miller’s <i>Lincoln and His World</i> series, represents the interest in Abraham Lincoln’s personal life.  As a study of the pre-presidential years, it is the author’s view on the growth and evolution of Abraham Lincoln.* </p>
<p>
The author’s quest is in his preface, </p>
<p>
<blockquote>Anyone who seeks to understand Lincoln’s White House years is unlikely to achieve that goal without knowing what Lincoln was doing in the half century before he became president.  Decades of experience shaped his response to Civil War challenges, and thereby <i>Lincoln and His World</i> contributes to [the] understanding of his presidency by illuminating his climb to that pinnacle. (1).</blockquote></p>
<p>
Early biographers of Abraham Lincoln including James G. Randall in 1936 have focused mainly on the public life y examining his political career and his presidential administration.  But Randall was a product of his time and never concentrated on such topics as Lincoln’s relationships with women, his melancholia and his troubled domestic life.  This gives us important lessons about Lincoln.</p>
<p>
Major biographies such as David Donald’s <i>Lincoln</i> (1995) illustrate that, as only about three percent of his text deals with the pre-Illinois legislative years of Lincoln.  Similar minimal attention appears in earlier biographies by Benjamin Thomas (1951) and Stephen Oates (1977).  Richard Carwardine (2007) covers this period in just two of more than three hundred pages.  The exception is William Herndon and Jesse Weik’s <i>Life of Lincoln</i> published in the late 1880s which relied extensively on interviews that Herndon had conducted in Indiana and Illinois shortly after Abraham Lincoln’s death.</p>
<p>
Sources potentially important for their Lincoln-related material are not always greeted warmly.  The first two volumes of Richard Lawrence Miller’s <i>Lincoln and His World</i> (2006, 2008) contain a mass of new Lincoln data, including Lincoln’s entry into politics before becoming a lawyer.  He excelled in both fields and, as such, Miller examines his rise to leadership.  This information, while not new, is largely unrecognized.  Miller’s survey of Illinois newspapers for all three of his volumes is immense.  Miller has also searched the political handbill collection in the Illinois State Historical Society which has remained largely overlooked until now.</p>
<p>
Miller’s first two large volumes have received mixed reviews – perhaps because he has, heretofore, not been considered a member of the Lincoln academy.  Miller documents Lincoln’s political world in all three volumes.  It is all encompassing with a Charles Dickens cast of characters, small-time political work and rivalry, partisanship that would make Tea Party members blush, and (of course) the worse kind of race baiting.  All of this is a valuable contribution to understanding Abraham Lincoln.  Paul Simon’s excellent account of Lincoln’s years in the Illinois legislature (<i>Lincoln’s Preparation for Greatness: The Illinois Legislative Years</i> (University of  Oklahoma Press, 1965) takes on added luster with Miller’s contributions.</p>
<p>
All of Richard Lawrence Miller’s volumes provide additional information in the notes.  This does give the reader a sense of Miller’s thoughts on the sources he cites.</p>
<p>
The scope of Miller’s project thus far– from 1809 to 1853– does reconstruct “the hidden world of Abraham Lincoln” by sifting through “a mass of verbal chunks left by Lincoln and persons around him”  (xi).</p>
<p>
As Miller said in his first volume covering 1809 through 1834, “I offer a very personal portrait of what Lincoln was all about . . . .  I present a world, not a point of view and not a drama” (xi).  Miller spends most of his time on this Lincoln in the context of American culture at the time.  There is narrative here with character development as he creates this mostly through the memories of those surrounding Lincoln.  The author possesses great courage by continually offering opinions.</p>
<p>
Volume 3 is organized chronologically:  The first two chapters (1843 and 1844) discuss Lincoln’s failed pursuit for a congressional seat; finally in 1845 Lincoln maneuvers towards a seat in Congress winning, in chapter 4, – “1846 - Victory at Last.”  Lincoln’s political rise continues in 1847 and 1848 in chapters 4 and 5, respectively, with his attendance at the 30th Congress, First Session and his attacks on President Polk and the need for the war with Mexico.  In chapter 7, “1848,” Lincoln does his best to insure the victory for Whig presidential candidate Zachary Taylor by campaigning for him in Illinois and Massachusetts.  Chapter 8 (“1848-1849”), shows Lincoln serving in the Second Session of this Congress.</p>
<p>
His only term in Congress ends and Lincoln is forced, yet again, to deal with slavery in chapter 9, “1850.”  For chapters 10, 11, and 12, Lincoln practices law and contends with the slavery issue while he practices law and politics.  The book ends on the cusp of the repeal of the Missouri Compromise with Lincoln’s political nemesis, Stephen A. Douglas, ushering through the Kansas-Nebraska Act, causing Lincoln’s major re-engagement in politics.</p>
<p>
Not everyone will be enamored with Volume 3, <i>The Rise to National Prominence 1843-1853.</i>  Some will object to Miller’s use of sources as too plentiful and eccentric.  Yet, they are helpful in understanding the man.  <i>Lincoln and His World is sui generis</i> and goes hand-in-hand with Douglas Wilson and Rodney Davis’s <i>Herndon’s Informants</i>.</p>
<p>
Miller’s book has great value and is distinctive because it contributes to the Lincoln literature and sets this biography apart by offering new material with new perspectives.  Those who do not like this book – just wait – there are always new Lincoln books in store.  All in all, we should be grateful Miller has chosen to be so inclusive as this is a robust, exceedingly rich menu with something for every taste.</p>

<p></p>
<p>
The year was 1862.  The Reverend J. Mitchell, the newly appointed Commissioner of Emigration escorted five African Americans into the White House at the president’s request.  Abraham Lincoln wanted to hear their views on colonization.</p>  
<p>
On that August afternoon, Lincoln told the men seated before him that Congress had recently appropriated a sum of money to colonize freed slaves.  Lincoln knew that African Americans might resist colonization but one wonders whether he realized the vehement opposition to the idea. “Why should they leave this country?” the president asked rhetorically.  He continued to provide them with an answer:</p>
<p><blockquote>
You and we are different races.  We have between us a broader difference than exists between almost any other two races.  Whether it is right or wrong I need not discuss, but this physical difference is a great disadvantage to us both, as I think your race suffer very greatly, many of them by living among us, while ours suffer from your presence.  In a word we suffer on each side.  If this is admitted, it affords a reason at least why we should be separated.  You here are free men I suppose.  (5 <i>Collected Works</i> 371).</blockquote></p>
<p>
A voice among them replied “Yes, sir” to the President’s rhetorical question.  Lincoln told them “Your race are suffering, in my judgment, the greatest wrong inflicted on any people.” (Ibid. 371-72).  Nevertheless, he asked them to consider whether removing their classification as slaves would really place them on equal grounds with the white race.  In Lincoln’s estimation, it would not.</p>
<p>
Lincoln urged the men to consider supporting colonization.</p>
<p><blockquote>
We look to our condition, owing to the existence of the two races on this continent.  I need not recount to you the effects upon white men, growing out of the institution of Slavery.  I believe in its general evil effects on the white race.  See our present condition---the country engaged in war!---our white men cutting one another’s throats, none knowing how far it will extend; and then consider what we know to be the truth.  But for your race among us there could not be war, although many men engaged on either side do not care for you one way or the other.  Nevertheless, I repeat, without the institution of Slavery and the colored race as a basis, the war could not have an existence.
It is better for us both, therefore, to be separated.  I know that there are free men among you, who even if they could better their condition are not as much inclined to go out of the country as those, who being slaves could obtain their freedom on this condition.  I suppose one of the principal difficulties in the way of colonization is that the free colored man cannot see that his comfort would be advanced by it.  You may believe you can live in Washington or elsewhere in the United States the remainder of your life [as easily], perhaps more so than you can in any foreign country, and hence you may come to the conclusion that you have nothing to do with the idea of going to a foreign country.  This is (I speak in no unkind sense) an extremely selfish view of the case.  (5 <i>Collected Works</i> 372).</blockquote></p>
<p>
Lincoln pointed, by example, to the successes in the colony of Liberia, with a population of 300,000 – 400,000, including some 12,000 American slaves who had settled there upon being freed.  Recognizing that African Americans might not want to settle as far away as Africa, Lincoln offered an alternative:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>The place I am thinking about having for a colony is in Central America.  It is nearer to us than Liberia---not much more than one-fourth as far as Liberia, and within seven days’ run by steamers.  Unlike Liberia it is on a great line of travel---it is a highway.  The country is a very excellent one for any people, and with great natural resources and advantages, and especially because of the similarity of climate with your native land---thus being suited to your physical condition.
The particular place I have in view is to be a great highway from the Atlantic or Caribbean Sea to the Pacific Ocean, and this particular place has all the advantages for a colony.  On both sides there are harbors among the finest in the world.  Again, there is evidence of very rich coal mines.  A certain amount of coal is valuable in any country, and there may be more than enough for the wants of the country.  Why I attach so much importance to coal is, it will afford an opportunity to the inhabitants for immediate employment till they get ready to settle permanently in their homes.  (5 <i>Collected Works</i> 373-74).</blockquote></p>
<p>
Lincoln asked the men to consider the idea and to help him get “a number of able-bodied men, with their wives and children, who are willing to go” and join the government’s colonization efforts.  Lincoln expressed that his plan would work so long as he could find “twenty-five able-bodied men, with a mixture of women and children…” who were willing to go.  (5 <i>Collected Works</i> 375).</p>
<p>
The president’s remarks, which were recorded by a reporter present, were printed in the <i>New York Tribune</i> the next day and, not surprisingly, were criticized by the newspaper as it was widely believed that colonization was cost-prohibitive.</p>

To many scholars, Lincoln’s interest in African colonization of former slaves seemed unrealistic and also inconsistent with the sixteenth president’s strong belief that slavery was morally wrong.  But Brazil, a country along with Cuba practicing slavery, also had an interest in sending former slaves to Africa. Perhaps, then, Lincoln’s idea may seem less surprising.  So I wonder if there is any evidence that Lincoln looked to Brazil’s policies of colonization/repatriation for his interest in sending the freed men to Africa, prior to the Emancipation Proclamation.  Neither the Collected Works nor the Robert Todd Lincoln Collection at the Library of Congress contain anything that suggests that Lincoln looked to Brazil.  Nevertheless, the two countries followed a similar course.</p>
<p>
In America, however, only weeks after Lincoln had interviewed the five African Americans at the White House, he took a step that perhaps purposefully foiled his colonization plans.  On September 22, 1862, he raised the hopes of the African American as they had never been raised before: he issued a preliminary emancipation proclamation, warning the rebellious states that if they did not lay down their arms by January 1, 1863, he would declare their slaves free.</p>
<p>
The failure of colonization in America may have been one of Lincoln’s own purposeful self-doing.  It is possible that Lincoln’s public actions were a way to prepare the white population for his emancipation policy, which would abolish slavery altogether.  That is, by advocating colonization in his annual messages and publicly, it would make his Emancipation Proclamation more acceptable to those who resisted it in the North.</p>
<p>
Historian Don E. Fehrenbacher has suggested “that Lincoln's support of colonization . . . Became during his presidential years a calculated, dissimulative strategy aimed primarily at the white mind rather than the black population — in other words, that he hoped for nothing more than a token emigration of blacks to relieve some of the racial fears engendered by the thought of emancipation.”  (Fehrenbacher,Civil War Book Review 221)</p>
<p>
By the time the Emancipation Proclamation had been issued, colonization was no longer supported.  An editorial in the New York <i>Tribune</i> read:</p> 
<p>
<blockquote>No one who has not thoughtfully and carefully and earnestly considered President Lincoln's proclamation will be likely to realize how admirable and comprehensive are its suggestions, and how surely their adoption will conduce to national integrity and internal peace. Look for a moment at the question of negro expatriation, which is one of the chief difficulties of our position. There are many worthy and good men, and ten times more of the other sort, who hold, that whenever slavery is abolished the negro should be sent out of the country. We have much charity for this opinion, for we once held it, but we are now convinced that it is an error. That the negro race, wherever free, will gradually migrate southward, colonizing the less populous West Indies, Central America, and the adjacent portions of South America, we believe. Climate, soil, natural products, ease of obtaining a rude yet ample subsistence, and the ready fraternisation of blacks with the Indian and mongrel races who now exist in those regions, and who are nowise above our Southern negroes in the social scale, not even in their own opinion, will all attract them that way. But if slavery were ended tomorrow, we are confident that even South Carolina would be in no hurry to expel from her soil the most industrious and productive half of her people; that portion amongst whom drunkards and profligates are scarce, while its office-seekers, bar-room loungers, and pot-house brawlers have yet to be developed. A State can spare its idlers far better than its workers, and it is only from dread of their influence on the slaves that a slave-holding people ever desire the expulsion of their free blacks. Were slavery dead this day, even the Carolina aristocracy would prefer, as labourers on the plantations, the negroes to whom they are accustomed, and whose manners are respectful and submissive, to any immigrants by whom they could be promptly replaced. It is quite likely that in time white labour would demonstrate its superior energy and intelligence by driving out the black. But for the present the Carolina planters would generally hire their ex-slaves more satisfactorily to themselves than they could replace them from any quarter. (Mitgang/Dicey, 80-81.)</blockquote></p>  
<p>
Ultimately, the end of slavery in America had a global impact, leading to a change in beliefs in other countries and the destruction of the institution in Brazil and Cuba, the only other places in the Western Hemisphere where it still existed.</p>  
<p>
As one abolitionist in Brazil remarked after the Brazilian government’s first steps toward abolition of slavery in 1871, he was glad “to see Brazil receive so quickly the moral of the Civil War in the United States.” (Degler, 42).</p>
<p>
In an interchange discussion which took place online over the course of several months in 2009 for the <i>Journal of American History</i>, Professor Nicola Miller opined:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>In Cuba . . . The impact of Lincoln was probably greatest and had the greatest social depth.  There, as in Brazil, the questions of abolition and emancipation were salient, and images of Lincoln figured in debates about slavery and abolition in a variety of (not always positive) ways.</blockquote></p>  
<p>
In their book <i>Colonization After Emancipation</i>, authors Phillip W. Magness and Sebastian N. Page likewise recognize the global affect of Lincoln’s policies, pointing to the British archives which includes an order authorizing a British agent to begin recruiting freed slaves to be sent to the Caribbean in June 1863.  As Magness and Page note, that scheme failed in early 1864, likely due to American polices, as British officials worried about the legality of the Emancipation Proclamation and the risk that the South could still win the war.  (Magness, 123). The authors deserve great credit for their research in a neglected British archive. Their book strongly suggests President Lincoln continued to support colonization after he issued the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863 through secret diplomacy with the British for the creation of a colony in British Honduras – now Belize. But there is a distinction between official U. S. government policy of supporting colonization with funding and contracts with private individuals and Lincoln’s personal view of voluntary colonization by free blacks. It is important to remember that the President’s annual message to Congress in 1862 – less than a month before the final Emancipation Proclamation continued to promote colonization as well as compensated emancipation as alternatives for dealing with African Americans. While the authors mention White House secretary John Hay’s diary entry of July 1, 1864 that Lincoln had, “sloughed off the idea of colonization,” they give it little credibility as Hay was not in the loop over the President’s continued efforts to promote colonization (Hay, 203). Yet, we need to take Hay at his word that Lincoln had genuinely given up colonization as his government’s policy without surrendering the idea as an option or alternative for free blacks. If this is so, then the documents uncovered by the authors make sense and the evidence is consistent with the view that Lincoln consistently supported colonization but only if free blacks gave their consent. It became obvious that most blacks opposed removing themselves from America, providing another reason Lincoln that retreated from colonization. Magness and Page also cite Benjamin F. Butler who, in his <i>Autobiography and Personal Reminiscences . . : Butler’s Book</i> (Boston: A. M. Thayer, 1892), represents that Lincoln discussed his wish to export “the negroes” especially those “whom we have armed and disciplined” to avoid “a race war.”(Butler, 903). But as Mark E. Neely, Jr. has proven, the story is doubtful as Butler was not present in Washington when he claimed that the interview with the President took place.</p>
<p>
This book attracted much attention when published over if, when, and how Lincoln treated this racist policy. But one thing is certain. Once the President allowed African-American enlistment in the army on January 1, 1863, he insured a biracial country because no one can ask a man to fight for his country and then tell him it is not his country.</p>
<p>
Ultimately, the flawed and disfavored concept of colonization never took hold in the United States, and by the time Lincoln had signed the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863, the word “colonization” was forgotten.</p>
<p>
Charles R. McKirdy’s <i>Lincoln Apostate: The Matson Slave Case</i> demonstrates the complex ad mixture of Abraham Lincoln’s anti-slavery beliefs, his commitment to the law while representing a slave owner and the fact that he was no abolitionist.  Why would this anti-slavery lawyer represent a slave owner seeking the return of his “property” – a runaway slave woman and her four children?  The author places Abraham Lincoln’s representation of Robert Matson, a Kentucky slave owner, in the context of 1847 – thirteen years before Lincoln became President.</p>
<p>
Eric Foner and others successfully argue that Lincoln changed and evolved.  During his time as a successful attorney and politician, President-elect Lincoln was no threat to slavery since he believed it was a local decision and for most of his life believed in colonization and, then as President, compensated emancipation.  This book does accurately point out Lincoln’s great faith in colonization which he, in part, learned from his mentor Henry Clay, his “beau ideal” of a statesman, despite disagreement from members of his cabinet and only ceasing to advocate it publicly after issuing the Emancipation Proclamation.</p>
<p>
It is not uncommon for lawyers, then and now, to take cases when their personal feelings differ from their clients.  That is what lawyers do.  Even one of Lincoln’s opposing counsel noted Lincoln’s aggressive advocacy:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>. . . His trenchant blows and cold logic and subtle knitting together and presentation of facts favorable to his side of the case, soon dissipated all hope that any advantage was likely to be gained by Lincoln’s liberal concession, but rather that he had gained from the court a more patient and favorable hearing and consideration of the facts on which he relied for success.</blockquote></p>
<p>
But the issue remains, why did Lincoln represent Matson in the case?</p>
<p>
The author explores one theory wherein Lincoln, as a Whig, espoused keeping one’s passion and feelings under control and the law, with its judicial system, maintained the order necessary to avoid mob rule.  As to slavery, Whigs accepted, if not embraced, it as protected by the Constitution and to deny it would lead to a breakup of the Union.</p>
<p>
Another theory is that at that point in his career, slavery had not reached the level of understanding by Lincoln of the power of this “peculiar institution” (Stampp, 3).   Lincoln was not yet sensitive enough to those held in bondage.  To McKirdy, this argument fails to properly evaluate “the insights of a very insightful man,” as in 1864 Lincoln wrote, “I am naturally anti-slavery.  As slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong.  I cannot remember when I did not so think, and feel.”  (McKirdy, 92), 7 <i>Collected Works</i>, 281). What the author fails to realize is that these comments came seventeen years after the Matson case.</p>
<p>
The author looks at Lincoln’s ego as the reason he took the case.  This high profile case would raise Lincoln’s stature – if not for abolitionists, at least for potential clients, the bench and bar.  The author does recognize Lincoln’s, “continued torment” (McKirdy,95; 1 Collected Works 1953:260)  and conflict as something that would never be attempted again on this issue.</p>
<p>
But that does not mean that Abraham Lincoln did not have misgivings about representing Matson, especially when, after being retained by him, he had a chance to represent the slave family but he had already committed himself to the slave owner.  Lincoln lost the case when the judges, hearing it, ruled that since slavery was illegal in Illinois, the slaves were free when they entered the state.</p>
<p>
Jane Bryant and her four children belonged to Robert Matson who brought slaves to farm his land in Coles County, Illinois, every year, returning them to Kentucky after harvest.  Despite the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 and the Illinois state constitution which made slaves free by residence on free soil, Lincoln argued that it was a long established custom that Jane Bryant was a seasonal worker and thus could not be considered a “resident” of Illinois.  The judges disagreed.</p>
<p>
What has been considered a paradox involving the “Great Emancipator” on the side of a slaveholder has continued to fascinate many over the years.  But as McKirdy points out, this ignores the jurisprudence as a slave’s “domicile” or residence and “sojourn” in a free state was a generally accepted distinction in American law. At the time, as this book points out, Abraham Lincoln and his co-counsel, Usher F. Linder, had the law on their side but not the judges – even though in 1843 the Illinois Supreme Court had ruled that  “sojourn” in Illinois by the owner and his slaves did not make the slaves free.  The judges, Samuel H. Treat and William Wilson, followed a new tradition in the North by ruling that slaves became free once they touched free soil, thus outraging the South.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Similar in format and length, both titles are well-written contributions to the new Concise Lincoln Library series of Southern Illinois University Press edited by Richard W. Etulain, Sara Vaughn Gabbard, and Sylvia Frank Rodrigue.<sup>1</sup> </p>
<p>While, at first glance, they cover separate issues, there is a common theme that runs through both--the relationships between Abraham Lincoln and his family and associates.</p>
<p>In Kenneth Winkle’s account of the Lincolns’ marriage, the author compares them to middle-class couples of Victorian America (125-126).  Abraham and Mary Lincoln’s entire lives are covered in under 150 pages.  An incongruity characterizes their relationship.  Mary was a strong asset to her spouse’s political career, but her personal issues became a negative for him.  The author demonstrates how Mary’s grief from the assassination of her husband was equal to that of her contemporary, Queen Victoria, when she lost her beloved Albert (115).  Despite the conflicts, the author insists that Abraham and Mary were true to their wedding vows reflected in the engraving on Mary’s wedding band—“Love is eternal.”</p>
<p>With the rare exception of individuals like Eleanor Roosevelt and Jacqueline Kennedy, First Ladies have, for the most part, remained invisible to the public and to historians, relegated to the private inner sphere of domesticity within the family circle.  Mary Lincoln, a bright, well-educated and ambitious young woman, was born and reared in the first half of the nineteenth century when women were expected to be pious, pure, submissive, and confined to the home.  Beginning in early childhood, Mary failed to conform completely to these social norms.  In addition to a propensity for elaborate clothing, she thoroughly enjoyed exercising her wit, especially in the forbidden realm of politics.  Her marriage marked a determination to become an active part in Abraham Lincoln’s political career.  As a result, harsh criticism followed throughout her life, persisting even into contemporary times.  Tragedy followed as well, leaving her vulnerable to the seduction of the spiritualist movement and to the maneuverings of her elder son, Robert, who eventually committed her to an insane asylum.  History’s portrait of Mary Lincoln, unlike that of her husband Abraham, is rarely flattering.  Yet she was an intelligent and resourceful woman supporting a courageous husband.  They were unquestionably devoted, as Kenneth Winkle ably demonstrates.</p>
<p><i>Abraham Lincoln and Horace Greeley </i>depicts a fluctuating and stormy relationship of allies and foes between these two strong men, as if Lincoln’s relationship with Mary were not challenging enough.  Both Lincoln and Greeley supported Henry Clay’s American system and their “right to rise” as self-made men (Gabor Boritt, <i>Lincoln and the Economics of the American Dream i</i>).  Both were reformers who abhorred slavery.  Despite the similarities, both were sometime adversaries.  The intricate relationship played out in the pages of Greeley’s <i>New York Tribune</i>.  Borchard explains the growth of these two leaders while discussing the end of the Whig Party, formation of the new Republican Party, and the advocating of “manifest destiny” to the Pacific.  Of course, the Civil War plays a major role in the lives of both men.  Borchard’s book is insightful, offering an excellent introduction to a political relationship between Lincoln and Greeley.  It is well-researched, engaging, and should capture readers interested in the Middle Period of our history.</p>
<p>The author’s use of pointed barbs from the <i>Tribune</i>, as well as the papers of both Lincoln and Greeley, gives us useful source material, too.  Both men met during their single congressional terms and became friends.  They voted the same on bills ninety-five times.  Greeley would later recall that</p>
<blockquote>I first met Mr. Lincoln late in 1848 at Washington, as a Representative in the Thirtieth Congress, the only one to which he was ever elected.  His was, as apportioned under the census of 1840, a Whig district and he was elected from it in 1846 by the largest majority it ever gave anyone.  He was then not quite forty years old; a genial, cheerful, rather comely man, noticeably tall, and the only Whig from Illinois, not remarkable otherwise, to the best of my recollection.  He was generally liked on our side of the House; he made two or three moderate and sensible speeches which attracted little attention; he voted generally to forbid the introduction of slavery into the still untainted Territories; but he did not vote for Daniel Gott’s resolve looking to the immediate abolition of slavery in the Federal District, being deterred by the somewhat fiery preamble thereto.” (37 & Horace Greeley, <i>Recollections of a Busy Life</i> (288) . </blockquote>
<p>Both were dedicated to freedom with a lifelong record of opposing slavery (13).  </p>
<p>Yet there was also conflict between them.  For example, when in 1858 Greeley became a leader of some eastern Republicans who endorsed Senator Stephen A. Douglas for reelection in Illinois.  While his efforts were to split the Democratic Party, his actions angered Douglas’s likely Republican opponent in Illinois-Abraham Lincoln.  The way this and other intermittent conflicts were resolved such as emancipation, presidential power ,and the winning of the war, are told with great verve by the author.</p>
<p>What is evident from these two volumes is how Lincoln used his potent political skills both at home and in his public career.  They are dramatic stories about a pivotal moment in United States history.  Both authors share a gift for capturing a sense of narrative and a talent for enabling readers to see and feel history in the making.  In these pages, Lincoln appears almost larger-than-life.  Yet despite enormous ambition, he demonstrates, most of the time, considerable humility.</p>
<p>Taken together, these brief volumes on Lincoln’s life create a detailed picture of an immensely complicated and, sometimes, conflicted individual.  They also reveal a prism by which to view his time in American life and politics during which the country experienced tumultuous and divisive cultural change.</p>

5359	978-0-252-03707-8	$35.00	A LOOK AT LINCOLN: <br>Putting Mary Lincoln On Trial<br> <i>Mary Lincoln's Insanty Case: A Documentary History</i>		Emerson, Jason			"<p></p>
<p>
Was Mary Lincoln a psycho spend-thrift who made Abraham Lincoln’s life a living hell or was she a strong-willed, bereaved woman from the death of three of her four sons and the assassination of her beloved husband?  Over the past 138 years, Mary Lincoln’s “insanity” has been studied closely and written about extensively.  Her case has been examined from feminist, legal, and medical angles.  It has been scrutinized from speculations on Robert Lincoln’s motives in 1875 for having his mother legally committed as insane to the Bellevue Place Sanitarium in Batavia, IL.  Another view emerged with Jason Emerson’s recently published <i>The Madness of Mary Lincoln </i>(Southern Illinois University Press) while this volume scrupulously provides source material to enable readers to form their own opinions.</p>
<p>

From the time she was committed against her will in May 1875 until her freedom four months later on August 24, Mary lived in a single room prisonlike structure.  When she was released, the <i>Chicago Times </i>declared “Her physicians pronounce her as sane” (126).  She had been given an hour’s advance notice before her trial on May 19, 1875.  The testimony of hotel staff, shop clerks, and four doctors who had never examined her, was admitted into evidence.  A jury declared her insane and her son Robert was made her guardian, responsible for her estate—including her substantial financial assets.</p>
<p>

Or was Robert driven by darker motives?  What caused Robert to have his mother humiliated and committed?  He claimed genuine concern for her well-being, alarmed at her bizarre behavior and statements.  She had told him that someone was trying to poison her and that a spirit was removing bones from her face, while he asserted that his mother “has been irresponsible for the past ten years”  (x).  Mary claimed he was interested in her wealth and possessions as she was heir to a third of her husband’s estate while Robert’s own financial needs far exceeded his earning power.  Moreover, biographer Jean Baker believes Robert feared that his mother’s strange behavior might ruin his political career.</p>
<p>

Mary’s rescue from the Bellevue asylum was accomplished by the legal team of James and Myra Bradwell.  It’s a drama within the family drama between mother and son.  Myra’s clandestine visits to Mary at Bellevue provoked more press coverage and a second trial in which Mary was declared “restored to reason,” and fully capable of managing her own assets (183).  Mary left the United States after her release from the asylum and moved to Europe for four years.</p>
<p>

Jason Emerson is a Lincoln family specialist with excellent detective skills.  Other historians have been equally fascinated with the Lincoln family history (e.g., see <i>The Insanity File: The Case of Mary Todd Lincoln </i>edited by Mark E. Neely, Jr. and R. Gerald McMurtry about the 1875 jury trial declaring Mary Lincoln insane as well as the role of her eldest son Robert, and the author’s excellent <i>Giant in the Shadows: The Life of Robert T. Lincoln</i>, Southern Illinois University Press).</p>
<p>

After her husband’s assassination, convention dictated that Mary Lincoln should live quietly, but social norms seldom ruled her life.  Her reputation was undermined from her obsession to buy many of the same items and not use them.  After Robert filed a petition to have her declared insane and committed, he then became the star witness at her hearing.  Mary was declared insane and ordered to the sanitarium.</p>
<p>

This documentary evidence contains startling details of Mary’s story before, during and after her trial leading to her eventual release from the sanitarium, as well as the damaging effects of Robert’s breach with his mother.  Drawing on primary sources, Jason Emerson presents a detailed portrait of a woman who remained her own person.  The more than 100 letters, many newspaper articles—including editorials, and legal documents, become almost bewildering.  Emerson includes daily patient progress reports from the sanitarium where Mary Lincoln was confined.  He also provides reminiscences, interviews and diary entries from people who knew her or were involved in the case, including one of the jurors in the 1875 trial.  The author is correct when he says, “This collection is a documentary history of Mary Lincoln’s mental illness and insanity case, and is a compilation of every possible primary source on the subject…” (xiii).</p>
<p>

Mary Lincoln emerges as a special woman with problems.  For Jason Emerson’s own opinions and interpretations, readers should look to his <i>The Madness of Mary Lincoln</i> (Southern Illinois University Press).  This volume gives readers easy access to the documents supporting his opinions.  Many may be surprised to learn that Emerson’s interpretations differ from Mary’s most recent sympathetic biographers—Jean H. Baker (<i>Mary Todd Lincoln: A Biography</i>) and Catherine Clinton (<i>Mrs. Lincoln: A Life</i>)—who both believe that Mary was forced into an asylum “by evil doctors and a heartless son” (xv).<p>
<p>
While some of these documents have appeared before, e.g., in Emerson’s <i>The Madness of Mary Lincoln</i>, and Mark E. Neely, Jr. and R. Gerald McMurtry’s <i>The Insanity File: The Case of Mary Todd Lincoln</i>, this collection is more extensive and allows readers the opportunity to make more informed judgments.</p>
<p>

Today, Mary Todd Lincoln remains more of an enigma than a reality, even as new evidence emerged in the form of a trove of letters long thought to have been destroyed (see <i>The Dark Days of Abraham Lincoln’s Widow as Revealed by Her Own Letters</i>, Southern Illinois University Press, also by Jason Emerson).  Nevertheless, her strength and intelligence cannot be discounted.</p>
<p>

Mary left the United States after her release from the asylum.  Based in Pau, France, she lived and traveled in Europe for four years.</p>
<p>

Always ranking near the bottom of the first-lady polls, even below Frances Harding, it seems Mary Lincoln deserves better.  She had great passion and a good mind, troubled as they may have been at times.  As for Robert, it may be sad justice that he also was institutionalized for depression in 1922.  Dysfunctional families and the relationships between mothers and sons have always been a part of human history and they continue to be to this day.  Leo Tolstoi said it best, “. . .every unhappy family is unhappy in its own fashion.” (Anna Karenina, Part I, ch. 1).</p>

5513	978-0-8108-8622-3	$45.00	A LOOK AT LINCOLN: <br>Lincoln's Impetuosity <br><i>The Day Lincoln Was Almost Shot: The Fort Stevens Story</i>		Cooling III, Benjamin Franklin			"

<h3>Lincoln's Impetuosity</h3>
<p>
It was in early July 1864 that Ulysses S. Grant had stolen a march on Robert E. Lee crossing the James River on his way to Richmond.  This led Lee to try once more the time-tested expedient of threatening Washington in order to force weakening Grant’s army.  He gave Jubal A. Early an army of 20,000 men to threaten the capital.  It marched up the Shenandoah Valley, slipped through a mountain pass, and headed for Washington.</p>
<p>
On July 11, Early’s army was at the defenses of the capital.  Undoubtedly he could have marched into Washington, but in a hastily-called council of war, there was unanimous agreement among his staff to avoid entering the city at that time.  Early, himself, subsequently declared that he had examined the fortifications confronting him, and had found them too strong for an assault by his weakened forces.</p>
<p>
One of his soldiers, however, John N. Opie, held a different opinion when the troops reached the suburbs of Washington.  He believed that the men who occupied the works were not seasoned troops, “A volley, a Rebel yell and a vigorous charge would have given us Washington.”  (210)  War correspondent Sylvanus Cadwalader of the <i>New York Herald</i> agreed with Opie.  “I have always wondered at Early’s inaction,” he wrote later.  (120)  Our lines at his front could have been carried at any point.  “Washington was never more helpless.  Any such cavalry commander as Sheridan, Wilson, Hampton or Stuart could have burned down the White House, the Capitol and all public buildings.”  (251- 252)</p>
<p>
President Lincoln had been staying nights at the Soldiers’ Home close to Fort Stevens in northern Washington.  On July 11, Early’s men had halted only two miles away when a squad of men from the War Department arrived with word from Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton that the President must quickly return to the city.  Lincoln rose, dressed and rode to the Executive Mansion.  The President was reported in excellent spirits and seemingly not the least concerned about the safety of Washington, even though Confederate troops were then facing Fort Stevens on the 7th Street road.</p>
<p>
The fort bristled with heavy guns, 19 in all, including five 30-pound rifle Parrotts and two mortars.  If properly manned, it would have been difficult to capture, but its complement of gunners was too small to afford even a single relief.</p>
<p>
Long before becoming a historian and author of books about the Civil War defenses of Washington, Benjamin Franklin Cooling, III, had grown up in the Fort Stevens neighborhood so he knows both the fort (now a historic site) and the surrounding area.</p>
<p>
When Early reached Fort Stevens by noon on July 11, his troops were exhausted and further burdened with prisoners and loot.  It was a hot July in Washington—93-94 degrees.  They had collapsed near Silver Spring, Maryland, so that Early was unable to motivate them for a full attack.  He decided to wait a day.</p>
<p>
The delay allowed Union troops to reinforce the city which was sparsely defended by convalescing soldiers and poorly trained recent recruits.  The veteran 6th Corps were pulled out of the trenches before Petersburg and debarked from transports at the foot of 7th Street.  Troops of the Corps’ 2nd Division hit the 7th Street road to Fort Stevens.  As a result, by the morning of the 12th, the Union line looked stronger, and reinforcements continued to arrive all day.  Therefore, Early decided the city could not be taken, so the day was spent skirmishing until the afternoon.</p>
<p>
Cooling believes that this was a very tenuous moment in the war with Lincoln’s re-election bid approaching and the capital under attack.  If the election had been held in July or August, the Democrats might have won.</p>
<p>
Like most of Washington, President Lincoln was feeling upbeat.  When word came of the 6th Corps’ deployment about the fort, he ordered his carriage, and with Mrs. Lincoln, set out to watch the show and such fireworks as might ensue.  Lincoln visited the battlefield on the 11th and 12th, the Commander-In-Chief rousing his troops but also the politician courting the electorate as he was very conscious of the soldier vote.  The presidential carriage arrived about 4:00 on the afternoon of July 12.  Without an escort, Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln went to the barracks behind the fort, which had been turned into a hospital.  General Horatio Wright, who commanded the 6th Corps, had been busy with arrangements placing one brigade of the Corps’ 2nd Division in trenches just in front of the fort with pickets advancing forward.  Gun crews were reinforced, and all was ready to give the Rebels a hot reception.</p>
<p>
Standing on the rampart, Lincoln could be seen by Confederate sharpshooters on the rise up Georgia Avenue.  On both days, men standing near him were shot, and someone—still unknown to this day—was said to have shouted, “Get that damned fool down!”  Captain Oliver Wendell Holmes, the future justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, “loudly proclaimed authorship in his senior years.”  (1, 179)  Cooling doubts this self-attribution as does Holmes biographer, G. Edward White (<i>Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes: Law and the Inner Self</i> – Oxford University Press,1993)(64-65).</p>
<p>
The question remains unresolved as to what order actually was given the President to get off the parapet and by whom.  Was it an admonition from General Wright, who claims he told his commander-in-chief, “Mr. President, this spot is too dangerous for you” and that “you really must get down from this exposed position,” or was it from Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.?  Benjamin P. Thomas, author of <i>Abraham Lincoln: A Biography</i>, claims it was Holmes, while Bruce Catton in <i>A Stillness at Appomattox</i> credits Wright.</p>
<p>
Regardless, by sunset on the 12th, Early’s troops were in full retreat.  Though the number of dead is uncertain, 17 Confederates and 40 Union men are buried nearby.</p>
<p>
In the end, the Confederates failed to capture Washington.  Early gave up the effort.  As he later told General Robert E. Lee, he felt his entire command would have been sacrificed—while they were needed in Virginia.  What is less well known, as this book points out, is that the day was marked by the singular event of someone making the commander-in-chief obey him.</p>

5517			CIVIL WAR TREASURES:<br>Beautiful Necessity:  Wallpaper and Confederate Imprints		Lacher-Feldman, Jessica			"<p>
Materials published during the Civil War in the Confederate states are known as Confederate imprints.  Exhaustive bibliographies and guides to these materials have been written over the years, the most widely known being <i>Confederate Imprints: A Bibliography of Southern Publications from Secession to Surrender </i>by T. Michael Parrish and Robert M. Willingham, published in 1987, and Marjorie Crandall’s <i>Confederate Imprints, 1861-1865.</i>  By reviewing these comprehensive bibliographies, we gain important insights into literary tastes of the time and the intellectual, creative, and practical output of a very specific time and place. The bibliographies also give us an increased understanding of what was being printed and used in terms of written material during the Civil War in the South.   While many of the materials published relate to the war itself, and to the operation of the Confederate government including acts and orders as well as other political documents, a need for printed matter beyond military and political publications certainly did exist.  Literature, music, newspapers, and school books all had their place in the corpus of Confederate-era publishing.</p>
<p>
What bibliographies do not tell us can really only be discovered through spending time with the material and some of the surprises it yields.  One remarkable byproduct of the scarcity of goods during this period are the few rare items we find that are printed on scraps of wallpaper.  The wallpaper, some as fresh as it was over 150 years ago, gives us a taste of hidden beauty and is a welcome surprise.</p>
<p>
LSU Libraries Special Collections holds a few wonderful examples of materials printed on wallpaper during the Confederacy.  One item, an historical novel by Luise Mühlbach entitled <i>Henry VIII and his Court,</i> was published by the Mobile, Alabama printer Sigmund H. Goetzel.  While Goetzel only published twenty-eight items in his years of operation between 1854 and 1865, several of the books that he did have remnants of wallpaper included.  The printing was done on the blank surface on the verso of the wallpaper.  The two-volume Mühlbach novel has two different wallpaper examples, both included on the inside of the book.</p>
<p>
We know from Mobile city directories and advertisements that Goetzel sold wallpaper as well as stationery and other paper goods in his shop.  Though we would like to think that the choice of using wallpaper was an aesthetic decision, it was more a matter of necessity. Paper and other goods had become increasingly scarce and wealthy Southerners were doing their best to survive so rather than choosing new wallpapers for their homes, the material was used for printing. Goetzel himself is a bit of a mystery.  A native of Austria, his life after the Civil War remains unknown. Some scholars claim that he moved to New Orleans, while others state that there is evidence that he emigrated to Brazil along with more than 10,000 Confederate Americans – the future “Confederados”.</p>
<p> 
Another interesting wallpaper example is a page from the July 2, 1863 issue of the Vicksburg, Mississippi <i>Daily Citizen,</i> part of the Eggleston-Roach Papers ( Mss. 832).  A surrogate copy of this newspaper fragment was recently included in our exhibit entitled <i>The Summer of 1863: Gettysburg, Vicksburg & Port Hudson.</i>  Again because of the lack of paper, the last issue of the Daily Citizen published before the surrender was printed on wallpaper.  It carries news of a woman, Mrs. Cisco, being killed during the bombardment and notes that her husband is serving with Moody’s Artillery in Virginia. </p>
<p>
These printed items cannot help but delight and surprise us, not only as historical artifacts and documents, but as culture artifacts and decorative objects.  Their rarity and beauty make them fascinating and important treasures indeed.</p>

5591	978-0-521-72226-1	$27.99	A LOOK AT LINCOLN: <br>Orations of a Serious Political Thinker		Ball, Terence			"

<h3>Orations of a Serious Political Thinker</h3>
<p>
As a part of <i>Cambridge Texts in the History of Political Thought,</i> the writings and speeches contained in this annotated edition demonstrate that Abraham Lincoln was a serious political thinker--not only in the context of his own time and circumstances—but for today, too.  The introduction is comprehensive and the selections are carefully edited with useful extensive annotation and footnotes.  They provide a better insight into Lincoln than many similar collections.  Readers see him as a man, a politician, and a political theorist.</p>
<p>
As a lawyer for 24 years, Lincoln represented thousands of people and many corporations in his hundreds of cases before judges and juries.  In the process, he became familiar with public sentiment as a political speaker and considered himself one of the common people.  His sarcasm, self-mockery, and humor were often pitched in the rhythm of the Bible.  His speeches and letters combined the political philosophy of Henry Clay, his mentor and “beau ideal of a statesman,” with the rhetoric of Daniel Webster.  As a resolute politician, Lincoln hoped to be and succeeded in being “truly esteemed by my fellow men.”</p>
<p>
These public writings reveal his abilities as a party spokesman and orator—first as a Whig and then as a Republican.  Adept at articulating the positions of his opponents—a trade he learned as a lawyer, he would first state an opponent’s position and then, often, criticized it with his own logical reasoning.</p>
<p>
The collection includes a letter to William H. Herndon (February 15, 1848) describing his opposition against the war with Mexico and President Polk’s expansion of presidential power—which Lincoln, himself, would do during the Civil War.  A decade earlier, on January 27, 1838, Lincoln, at the Springfield Lyceum, called for obedience to the law and in his well-researched speech at New York’s Cooper Institute, he used the voting records of Constitutional framers to demonstrate Republican consistency against the extension of slavery in the territories.  By attaching himself to founding principles, he projected himself to early prominence in a crowded field of presidential contenders.</p>
<p>
These writings illuminate Lincoln’s political career and how his two careers—law and politics—were inextricably entwined.  He became the nation’s lawyer-in-chief in the Executive Mansion.</p>
<p>
The material testifies to the complexities of Lincoln’s character.  The threat of slavery’s expansion into the territories changed his political life in 1854.  The book includes several speeches on the subject, notably those attacking the Kansas-Nebraska Act (October 16, 1854) and the Dred Scott decision (June 26, 1857), as well as his reply to Senator Stephen A. Douglas during one of their 1858 debates (October 15, 1858).  His views on race and slavery, and the contradiction between the Declaration of Independence, “All men are created equal,” and the Constitution condoning slavery, are laid out in Lincoln’s own well-crafted words.</p>
<p>
This is one of the best selections of Lincoln’s writings available today and, timely too, with its publication during the sesquicentennial of the Civil War.</p>

5667	9781621570837	$27.95	A LOOK AT LINCOLN: <br>Little Known Witnesses To History<br><i>Backstage at the Lincoln Assassination</i>		Bogar, Thomas A.			"
<p>
Abraham Lincoln’s murder on Good Friday, April 14, 1865, opened an ongoing wound.  It was America’s first presidential regicide.  Coming after four years of a brutal war and at the time of the restoration of peace as well as seeking reconciliation between North and South, Lincoln’s homicide seemed especially senseless.  Occurring just before Easter Sunday, it encouraged making Lincoln a saint akin to Jesus Christ, since some believed that it was punishment for the conflict and the institution of slavery which caused it.</p>
<p>
Many, historians and the public alike, have treated the Lincoln assassination as a subset to the epic story of the Civil War.  There have been, it is estimated, more than 2,000 books written on the assassination—out of a total of 16,000 written on Lincoln and 65,000 on the war—approximately one a day since the war ended.</p>
<p>
Few books have attempted to show how contemporary citizens responded to the crisis at the time and what their response suggests about the American character at the end of a rebellion that nearly toppled the nation.  Some Lincoln biographers devote only a few lines to this tragedy and hardly examine or acknowledge the change it made to the country.</p>
<p>
In 15 chapters plus an epilogue, this book, as if it were an <i>Upstairs, Downstairs</i> presentation, tells the story of 46 personalities of the Ford’s Theatre’s staff who were present and working at the time of the 10:15 p.m. assassination.  The author performs a splendid task in describing these individuals and their activities on this grim day and the atmosphere in Washington, with its shock, confusion and anger.</p>
<p>
In addition to many photographs of these personalities, including a map of the neighborhood printed between its covers, the volume is a docudrama with endnotes.  And the story is glibly told.  It is succinct, entertaining and informative with some overlap of the timeline in order to keep the reader from being confused.  The actions of Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, Judge Advocate General Joseph Holt, and Lafayette Baker intrude to intimidate and threaten staff and members of the cast by suggesting testimony—actually suborning perjury.</p>
<p>
This is a welcome addition to the Lincoln assassination story as little has been published about the cast and staff.  The stories are objectively told and one is left to form his or her own conclusion.  The assassination itself is not the focus here as the book concentrates on the players and their activities.</p>
<p>
For the assassination itself, one needs to turn to other volumes.  One of the best, if not the best, is Edward Steers, Jr.’s <i>Blood on the Moon: The Assassination of Abraham Lincoln</i> (University of Kentucky Press, 2001), which is the definitive account of Lincoln’s assassination.  Nor is it filled with misinformation such as the commercially successful <i>Killing Lincoln</i> by Bill O’Reilly and Martin Dugard.  Steers proves that the conspiracy theories involving Vice President Andrew Johnson and Secretary of War Stanton are totally unreliable but suggests that the Confederate government was aware of John Wilkes Booth’s schemes to kidnap Lincoln, if they did not directly support it.</p>
<p>
Richard Bak’s <i>The Day Lincoln Was Shot: An Illustrated Chronicle</i> (Taylor Publishing Company, 1998) includes excellent contributions by authors who are experts in their fields of the assassination.  William Hanchett wrote the chapter placing the assassination in context and Harold Holzer wrote the chapter containing background information about President Lincoln.  Richard E. Sloan discussed how Lincoln and the assassination has been portrayed in film.  The title of this book replicates Jim Bishop’s, which was the first book about the assassination that I read at the age of 12.  While Mr. Bishop has discounted the value of his <i>The Day Lincoln Was Shot</i> (Harper & Row, 1955 – reprinted in 2013) much still commends it as one of the best narratives of the events surrounding the assassination. Bishop’s well known style covers the period hour-by-hour, incorporating all of the characters involved.</p>
<p>
William Hanchett’s <i>The Lincoln Murder Conspiracy </i>(University of Illinois Press, 1983) successfully rebuts a broad conspiracy that went beyond John Wilkes Booth and his cohorts.  The allegations attempt to impugn Secretary of War Edwin Stanton.  This theory came from Otto Eisenschiml’s <i>Why Was Lincoln Murdered?</i> published in 1937.  His off-the-wall theory influenced many, including Jim Bishop in his <i>The Day Lincoln Was Shot</i> and continues to fascinate the public.  Hanchett completely disproves Eisenschiml’s allegations.</p>
<p>
Like Thomas A. Bogar’s Backstage at the Lincoln Assassination…, Thomas Goodrich’s <i>The Darkest Dawn</i> (Indiana University Press, 2005) organizes his book, not by the events, but by the key characters involved and the effect the assassination had on them as well as the public.</p>
<p>
Kate Larson Clifford, in her <i>The Assassination’s Accomplice, Mary Surratt, and the Plot to Kill Abraham Lincoln</i> (Basic Books, 2008), argues Mary Surratt was guilty and her death, by hanging, deserved.  Despite inexperienced attorneys and trial by a military commission with a foregone verdict, the author presents serious evidence against Mary Surratt, suggesting that the commission reached a correct result despite the many problems with the trial.</p>
<p>
<p>In one of the reports by someone who was present at Ford’s, Dr. Charles A. Leale’s <i>Lincoln’s Last Hours</i> (Kessinger Publishing, LLC, 2010) is the story of the army surgeon’s account of Lincoln’s fatal wound as he attended Lincoln immediately after the shooting.</p>
<p>
For historical fiction, James L. Swanson’s <i>Manhunt: The 12-Day Chase For Lincoln’s Killer</i> (HarperCollins Publishers, 2006) is a must read.  It is as good as you can get and close to Pulitzer Prize winning <i>The Killer Angels </i>by Michael Shaara.  <i>Manhunt</i> is a narrative by those who sought Booth as well as from Booth and David Herold who were the hunted.</p>
<p>
The contemporary account by Louis J. Weichmann in <i>The True History of the Assassination of Abraham Lincoln and of the Conspiracy of 1865</i>, edited by Floyd E. Risvold (Alfred A. Knopf, New York 1975), represents the tragic drama of the person who consorted with at least 11 of the characters believed to be involved in the plot to either kidnap or murder Lincoln.  Louis Weichmann resided in Mary Surratt’s Washington boarding house with the conspirators and was the primary witness for the government against the conspirators.  Weichmann remains controversial to this day, with many challenging his credulity and testimony that led to the conviction of Dr. Samuel A. Mudd and the conviction and execution of Mary Surratt.</p>
<p>
And nothing equals Michael Kaufman’s <i>American Brutus: John Wilkes Booth and the Lincoln Conspiracies</i> (Random Hopuse, 2005) in describing and understanding John Wilkes Booth.</p>
<p>
All these works, including <i>Backstage at the Lincoln Assassination</i>…, help place this horrific event within the context of the tumultuous times in which it occurred, and depicts its momentous dimensions.  It’s a fresh contribution to the Lincoln assassination literature.</p>

<p>
Many contribute the victory of the Union during the Civil War to Abraham Lincoln, but much of the success stems also from the contributions of the Union governors.  President Lincoln understood the necessity of gaining and retaining gubernatorial support would help to bolster his policies.  <i>Lincoln and the Union Governors</i> by William C. Harris provides a fresh insight into the complex relationship between Lincoln and the Union governors in this dynamic partnership.</p>
<p>
Although many accused Lincoln of attempting to create a centralized federal government to diminish the power of the states, Lincoln considered his partnership with state executives essential to achieving reunion and emancipation.  Despite these accusations, Lincoln’s intention “was not so much to resolve the conflict between localism and centralism as to keep that conflict from fatally crippling the war effort” (pg. 2).  In truth, Lincoln fully understood securing the governors’ cooperation required treading carefully.</p>
<p>
During the course of the war, 59 men served as governors of the 25 Union states.  Most of these governors were from Lincoln’s Republican or National Union Party and had earlier associated with the Whig party.  The governors who did not affiliate with his party were loyal to the Union, except for Missouri’s Claiborne Fox Jackson, who favored the Confederates and fled south in July 1861.  Despite their overwhelming support for the war, the governors reflected different regional interests making unanimity difficult to achieve.  Harris credits the September 1862 governors’ conference at Altoona, Pennsylvania, with coalescing support for Lincoln in order to maintain a unified war effort and assisting in President Lincoln’s re-election.</p>
<p>
Although Lincoln is considered the spearhead of the Union war effort, the governors actively served as war ministers throughout the course of the war.  This included rallying citizens for the war, organizing state regiments for the Union army, raising troops and support for their families, sustaining morale, encouraging perseverance, and suppressing treason.  In addition, the governors kept Lincoln informed about political conditions in their states.</p>
<p>
<i>Lincoln and the Union Governors</i> offers a short primer on the important aspects of the war.  It’s an easy read for anyone interested in Lincoln and Civil War scholarship.</p>
<p>
The removal of slavery from the American republic and the preservation of the Union owed a great deal to the cooperation that Abraham Lincoln received from the governors.  The Emancipation Proclamation would not have been enacted if it were not for their support.  Lincoln’s two-part Emancipation Proclamation in January 1863 had not only controversially freed the slaves in the Confederacy but also encouraged the arming of African Americans to fight for the Union.  <i>Lincoln and the U.S. Colored Troops</i> by John David Smith focuses on the second part of Lincoln’s emancipation program—the implementation, recruitment, and deployment of black troops.  This two-part emancipation program of freeing and then arming the slaves brought into conflict two basic tenets of American life—democratic ideals and white racism.  No chief executive had issued such a controversial order.  It achieved an immediate and long lasting impact on American history.</p>
<p>
Smith illustrates the apparent contradictory, tentative, and vacillating nature of Lincoln during the shaping of his emancipation project.  Despite the President’s opposition to slavery on economic and humanitarian grounds, he confronted complex constitutional and political questions of sovereignty and law.  However, within two years, Lincoln went from hesitation to enthusiasm because he believed emancipation “was both morally right and also expedient as a means of prosecuting the war against the Southern Confederacy” (pg. 5).</p>
<p>
The United States Colored Troops (USCT) signified the first systematic large scale effort by the U.S. government to arm blacks, who had previously “been doomed to slavery,” to aid in the nation’s defense.  Although initially hesitant to arm them, Lincoln came to admire their service and staked the credibility of his racial policies on their performance.  By the end of the war, there were a surprising 178,975 black soldiers which represented 21 percent of the eligible black male population (some 200,000 if black sailors are included).  The participation of African Americans in the USCT fashioned the meaning of the war from one fought for the Union into one fought for Union and African American freedom.  Many historians have reported that the USCT exceeded expectations and were just as successful, if not more so, than all-white infantry units.</p>
<p>
Despite the successes of the USCT, the black soldiers still faced hardships and inequalities due to fears of black insurrection and mayhem.  The majority of black unit officers were white.  In addition, though colored troops fought in 449 military engagements, they received a far greater amount of fatigue duty than their white counterparts.  They were less fed, less paid, and given less medicine than whites, while facing murder or being sold into slavery by the Confederates.  Despite the hardships and inequalities they faced throughout the course of the war and many decades following emancipation, African Americans still viewed President Lincoln as their emancipator and savior.</p>
<p>
<i>Lincoln and the U.S. Colored Troops</i> provides a short and definitive exploration of the implementation, recruitment, engagement, sacrifices, and contributions of the USCT under President Lincoln’s emancipation program.  The author has written a riveting, often neglected half of this transformative project.  It’s a must read for anyone interested in African American soldiers, Abraham Lincoln, and the Civil War.</p>

5867			Civil War Treasures: <br>Hire a Vet: Ex-Confederates Look for Work in the New South		Rasmussen, Hans			"<p>Veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan can turn to entities from the Federal Government to Hire Heroes USA to Spike TV for help in finding jobs in a tough economy, but the problem of unemployment among veterans and the need for assistance is hardly new.  The Bonus Army of unemployed veterans from World War I marched on Washington in 1932 demanding cash-payment redemption of their service certificates, while the post-World War II G.I. Bill was passed to avoid a repeat of that outrage partly by providing unemployment compensation.  A diminutive pamphlet in the LSU Libraries Special Collections illustrates how unemployment cursed veterans of the Civil War as well, and how their fellow comrades came to their aid.</p>
<p>

</p
<p><b><i>List of Applicants for Employment </i>(second edition) </b>is a pamphlet only eight pages long and not 3 x 5 inches in size issued by the Confederate Veterans’ Employment Bureau of New Orleans probably around 1900.<sup>1</sup>  With the nation still mired in the Panic of 1893, the United Confederate Veterans camps in New Orleans organized an employment bureau in November 1895 to aid veterans still able to work or unable to enter the Confederate soldiers’ home because of ties with wives or children.  The bureau requested that camps include, as part of their regular business, calls for names of veterans needing employment and news of any available job opportunities, reporting both to the bureau.  It kicked off its campaign with a published appeal for planters, merchants, and industrialists to “obtain help, and at the same time benefit a worthy class of citizens.”</p>  

<p><blockquote>The claims of these patriotic citizens cannot be disregarded—they are enforced by a record honorable to the State—they are accentuated by a history of bravery and self-sacrifice that has rendered their deeds memorable.  Their exemplary and law-abiding citizenship since the war enhances their soldiery records, and calls for favorable consideration.  They make no appeal for charity; they but ask opportunities for work.<sup>2</sup></blockquote></p>

<p>The Confederate Veterans’ Employment Bureau printed pamphlets like this one to spread the word about veterans down on their luck.  The brochure lists alphabetically the names of veterans seeking employment.  Each entry gives his name, regiment, address, and type of employment sought.  Although most resided in New Orleans, applicants came from across the region.  Nearly all sought working-class occupations, especially as clerks, watchmen, porters, or laborers.  Most entries followed these common patterns:</p>



<p><blockquote>B H Collins, Co H, 7<sup>th</sup> La Vol Inft Hays Brig. 1132 Valmont st.  Watchman, carpenter.</p>

<p>P A McDonald, Co A, St Paul’s Battalion Memorial Hall.  Collector, clerk or watchman.</p>

<p>John Reaney, Priv Co B, 8<sup>th</sup> La Vol Inft 1<sup>st</sup> Brigade, A N Va. 2334 Chippewa st.  Clerk or light labor.</blockquote></p>

<p>Several applicants listed specialized trades like civil engineer, cotton classer, baker, confectioner, railroad conductor, even a man with experience as a pilot on the Atchafalaya River and Bayou Teche.</p>

<p><blockquote>J B Lebas, Co D, 5th La Regt Charenton, La.  Sugar maker and refiner.</p>

<p>M D Fazende, Co F, Orleans Guard. 1916 Felicity st.  Overseer or manager.</blockquote></p>

<p>More were just desperate.</p>

<p><blockquote>Philip Duvernay, Co E, 20th La Regt. 1813 Tulane ave.  Anything.</blockquote></p>

<p>The bureau included names of veterans’ family members when the head of household was unable to work.</p>

<p><blockquote>Miss Mary L. Connelly, daughter of John Connelly, Co B, 14th La.   Any ladies position.</p>

<p>Mrs M E Jones, wife of Capt E Jones, Co K, 17th Va Regt. North street, Vicksburg, Miss. Sales lady.</p>

<p>Julien Porta, son of [C]esare Porta, Co A, 18th La, Army Tenn, [C]amp 2. Central La.  Apprentice or clerk; wants to learn a trade. </blockquote></p>

<h3>Lincoln’s Long Funeral Procession through History</h3>
<p>Abraham Lincoln died on April 15, 1865 – the morning after he was shot by John Wilkes Booth.  A funeral train carried his remains more than 1,600 miles from Washington to his final resting place in Springfield – his home town.  The 150th anniversary of his assassination and funeral, widely commemorated in April and May, included an exhibit of the replica of the President’s funeral car, a funeral procession through Springfield, and his “internment” in a temporary vault at Oak Ridge Cemetery.  Organizers wanted the events – plays, museum exhibits, and re-enactments – to remind people that his death shaped history in ways that are still felt today.  His death personified Lincoln’s sacrifice as well as redemption in the form of final freedom. </p>
<p>Martha Hodes writes in her important <i>Mourning Lincoln</i> that despite the intense and wide-spread hatred for Lincoln that existed during the war, even in the North, there was also intense mourning for him after he was assassinated.  With Civil War deaths exceeding 750,000 Americans – most had mourning ribbons and other accoutrement at the ready. </p> 
<p>Richard Wightman Fox insists that some Lincoln haters experienced a strong reaction in his favor because of his apparent awkwardness stemming from his unusual height and the length of his stride.  Fox writes, “For four years he had flung his door open to all who went to the White House, and here, at the very end, he was still welcoming the common people to his side” with his casket on public view in the Executive Mansion.  The President had been admonished by people like Senator Henry Wilson of Massachusetts that his “public opinion baths” would wear him down.  Lincoln responded, “They don’t have much, will get but little, so I must see them.”  Now, millions saw him in the White House and along the tracks for the 12-day journey stopping in the leading the cities of seven states for funeral services. </p>   
<p>Both Hodes and Fox point out that the mourning for Lincoln was real and the train ride of his remains to Springfield moved Americans in a way that is still reflected in Lincoln mythology.  Both authors point out that the President who led the North to victory is more admirable than the myth and this is the President whose death silenced, but did not convert, all his enemies. </p>
<p>Fox is exceedingly skillful – as is Hodes – in claiming that the shot fired at Ford’s Theatre on the night of April 14th was only the first engagement in a long war that followed Appomattox – a struggle for citizenship by African Americans.  But neither author fully pursues this aspect of the story. </p>  
<p><i>Lincoln’s Body</i> is a tour de force describing how Lincoln has been interpreted and used during the past 150 years – in speeches, statues, plays, films, poems, and artwork.  While most impressive when writing about the Lincoln Memorial, with the attendees segregated when it was dedicated in 1922, Fox is very deferential when writing about Steven Spielberg’s film <i>Lincoln</i> and Doris Kearns Goodwin’s popular book, <i>Team of Rivals</i>. </p>
<p>Of the many recent publications commemorating the sesquicentennial of the death of the best president America ever produced, both books contribute significantly to understanding this awful event.  Hodes explores diaries, letters, and other personal writings written during the spring and summer of 1865 to obtain the reactions to the death.  “‘Tears’ the saddest day in our history,” wrote one, and “An electric shock to my soul,” wrote a free black who had escaped from slavery, while a Lincoln enemy exclaimed, “Glorious News!” </p>
<p>Both books add to our understanding that the war did not end with Lincoln’s death as the quest for peace among our “House Divided” is even now illusory. </p>

</p>

<p>At the close of its sesquicentennial, the Civil War is still seen as an ennobling sacrifice, resulting in the liberation of four million slaves.  Yet, historians have removed much of the luster from this four-year blood bath and question its beatification.  After all, the war killed over 750,000 Americans, and the sesquicentennial ignored the question of whether this war was necessary and justified. </p>
<p>Revisionist historians from the 1920s to the 1940s argued that the war was not an inevitable clash over irreconcilable issues.  Rather, it was a needless bloodletting which was the fault of “blundering” statesmen and “pious cranks,” the abolitionists.  Writing when they did, these critical authors considered the twenty million losses from World War I and concluded that all war was irrational.  World War II undermined this view somewhat because Nazism and aggressive militarism was viewed as a modern form of slavery.  The post-World War II Civil Rights Movement placed slavery and emancipation at the center of the Civil War and made the slaughter seem worthwhile. </p>
<p>Not everyone agrees.  Neo-Confederates refuse to accept the centrality of slavery in the war.  Historian David Goldfield in <i>America Aflame</i> argues that the war was over slavery but it was also “America’s greatest failure.”  He indicts politicians, extremists, and the influence of evangelical Christianity for dividing the nation to the point where any compromise became impossible.  Freedom was the war’s great achievement, he agrees, but white supremacy was so entrenched in the North as well as in the South that the newly freed people became subject to economic peonage and incessant lynching.  It would take a century and the Civil Rights struggle for blacks to achieve legal equality. </p>
<p>This new volume of six essays, edited by Stephen Engle, offers interpretations of Lincoln and the Civil War which argue that despite the immense toll in blood and treasure, the effort was worth it.  The essays and an epilogue analyze Lincoln as leader, diplomat, communicator-in-chief, and commander-in-chief.  Three essays discuss northern culture during the war. </p>
<p>Orville Vernon Burton reiterates the argument he presented in his <i>Age of Lincoln</i>.  The United States, he argues, was becoming an industrial wage-based society rather than an agrarian one.  Slavery was a contradiction to the free-soil, free-labor, policy of the North, and Lincoln, who himself was a product of free-labor and the epitome of “the right to rise,” strongly believed in the validity of this transformation.  He held high the vision of equality exclaimed in the Declaration of Independence. </p>
<p>As a great communicator, Lincoln was eloquent in how he explained wartime behavior to northern civilians.  J. Matthew Gallman uses Lincoln’s personal and public messages to demonstrate the President’s expectations for northern citizens.  These included loyalty, patriotism, engagement with national events, and voting, but it did not include the demand for any real sacrifice. </p>
<p>While Lincoln expected his generals to fight, Mark Grimsley believes that the President’s interference with military operations sometimes led to failure, as was the case in the Shenandoah Valley in 1862.  The author does not indicate that, as commander-in-chief, he had no choice but to deal with his many inept commanders.  Author Richard Carwardine views Lincoln in the same context and argues that his success in this sphere was the reason that Lincoln became such a superlative leader. </p>
<p>Although some historians believe that the President was weak in foreign affairs, Howard Jones finds that Lincoln was in reality a natural diplomat whose foreign policy prevented England and France from intervening in the Civil War.  Secretary of State William H. Seward was indeed the chief diplomat, but Lincoln remained in full control throughout. </p>
<p>As the nation enters the sesquicentennial of Reconstruction, Brooks Simpson insists that Lincoln’s Reconstruction policy – such as it was and can be determined – should not be considered in a vacuum separated from his military objectives.  The President’s support for the restoration of a civil government in the Southern states was a key way he believed that freed men could gain the rights of citizenship.  Simpson believes that Lincoln’s biggest mistake during the war was his acquiescence in the selection of his Vice President, Andrew Johnson, “A man who held such different views when it came to what freedom meant.”  But Abraham Lincoln never expected to be assassinated during his second term.  He saw his 1864 re-election as giving him the chance to put the nation on the higher road of Reconstruction and reconciliation. </p>
<p>One of the many challenges that Lincoln faced and one that is underestimated – even today – is the role of the Copperheads.  Jennifer Webber believes that these northern Democrats were a significant threat to Lincoln and the war effort causing the President to take political risks in order to fulfill his belief in freedom for African Americans. </p>
<p>These opponents of the President continually criticized administration measures, especially the suspension of habeas corpus.  Mark E. Neely, Jr. believes that the Copperheads were so successful in repudiating the President’s policy in this area that they actually created the myth that Lincoln was weak on protecting civil liberties when he suspended habeas corpus.  Neely examines fifty habeas corpus cases from 1862-1863 and finds minimal resemblance, as Copperheads charged, that suspension of habeas corpus was a frontal attack on freedom of speech.  The cases were really attacks concerning under-aged soldiers and child custody. </p>
<p>During the war, black activists initiated major changes in Washington with the support of congressional Republicans.  Kate Masur reviews this battle for racial equality and cites the primary efforts of African Americans in trying to accomplish it. </p>
<p>The epilogue, by Michael Burlingame, articulates the reasons he believes that Lincoln was so successful.  The President was “strong willed without being willful, moral without being moralistic, and righteous without being self-righteous.”  As such, he “inspired confidence and affection” and possessed a “profound understanding of public opinion.” </p>
<p>It is clear that Lincoln’s standing among scholars and with the American public has survived the Civil War Sesquicentennial.  He remains America’s greatest chief magistrate.  Yet, in many respects, the struggle for racial justice for national cohesion continues.  As Abraham Lincoln said at Gettysburg, it is for “us the living” to rededicate ourselves to the unfinished work of the Civil War.  Only then will the sacrifices of the Civil War generation be validated. </p>

6175			" LOOK AT LINCOLN: <br>Lincoln and the ""Right to Rise"""		Williams, Frank J.			"<p>
<b>A Just and Generous Nation: Abraham Lincoln and the Fight for American Opportunity</b><br>
by Harold Holzer and Norton Garfinkle<br>
<b>Publisher:</b>Basic Books<br>
<b>Retail Price:</b> $27.99<br>
<b>ISBN:</b>9780465028306<br></p>


<p>The Library of Congress has estimated that a book about Abraham Lincoln has been published every five and a half days.  It is obvious, since the bicentennial of Lincoln’s birth in 2009, that rate has increased.  It appears there may be one a day with over 16,000 books and pamphlets published about him since 1865. </p>  
<p>But that is not to say that there is not room for more edifying books about the nation’s 16th President.  This is just such a book.  Nothing compares to it since Gabor Boritt’s <i>Lincoln and the Economics of the American Dream</i> (Memphis State University Press, 1978), which presented Lincoln’s detailed economic concerns long before he became president and what America should become. </p> 
<p><i>A Just and Generous Nation</i> is actually two volumes in one.  Harold Holzer, one of the foremost Lincoln scholars, presents in the first section an unassailable argument that Lincoln fought the Civil War “in pursuit of economic opportunity for the widest possible circle of hard working Americans.” This required the destruction of slavery.  Economist Norton Garfinkle follows this with a survey of political and economic history since Lincoln’s death and compares policies of subsequent American presidents to those promoted by Lincoln. </p> 
<p>I believe in the late New York Governor Mario M. Cuomo’s admonition that we should eschew political labels, e.g. “liberal,” “conservative,” etc.  Yet, this book challenges that notion by making Lincoln a liberal Democrat and holding his successors to the same standard.  It was Lincoln who strengthened the federal government by imposing the first income tax, conscription, support of the Homestead Act, and the transcontinental railroad.  He also defined the powers of the president and that office’s war powers. In attempting to answer what Lincoln would do today, one would be hard pressed to see Lincoln, according to this book, against favoring immigrants, raising taxes on the rich, and supporting education and healthcare with significant federal funds. </p>    
<p>Of course, many Republicans do not see Lincoln this way.  Yet Lincoln saw labor superior to capital and never was against the “right to rise.”  On the other hand, he didn’t “believe in the law to prevent a man from getting rich.”  In his time there was a need for unskilled labor.  Today, unskilled laborers are fortunate to find work, and even then wages have been falling.  While  most Americans today believe in racial equality, the gap widens.  Just check Affirmative Action and voting rights disputes. </p> 
<p>Former New York Governor  Mario Cuomo’s favorite Lincoln quotation on this subject, made in 1854, “The legitimate object of government is to do for a community of people, whatever they need to have done, but can not do, at all, or can not, so well do, for themselves in their separate, and individual capacities,” underlies the authors’ positions.   Lincoln’s economic spirit, from the very beginning of his political career, reflected support for “internal improvements” including education, canals, and railroads – the mantra of the Whig Party for which Lincoln labored assiduously.  Creation of land grant colleges would come later as did the funding for the first transcontinental railroad. </p>
<p>The last part of the book surveys actions of presidents who followed Lincoln, like Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Lyndon Johnson, Harry Truman, and Barack Obama, who make the grade of following Lincoln’s economic policies.  Others, such as William Taft, Warren Harding, Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover, Ronald Reagan, and George W. Bush come up short.  Readers will have to make up their own minds about the nature of these presidents’ economic policies and whether or not they achieved the vision advocated by both our Founders and President Lincoln. </p>
<p>Fifty years ago, historian David Donald wrote a well-known essay “Getting Right with Lincoln.”  Presidents have tried “to get right with Lincoln” by believing that their economic policies echo Lincoln’s. </p>
<p>This is a provocative book, as I think the authors intended.  In closing, one must ask Gabor Boritt’s time honored question.  Do we still have “the right to rise?”</p>

6176			Civil War Treasures: <br>A Legacy of Children's Civil War Literature in Words and Pictures: <i>The Michael Lehman Williamson Collection of Civil War Books for Young People</i>		Lacher-Feldman, Jessica			"<p>In 1994, in honor of his son’s passing, B. Lehman Williamson established the <i>Michael Lehman Williamson Collection of Civil War Books for Young People</i>. This collection features books about aspects of the Civil War, published from 1862 to the present.  This collection, with over  900 books about the Civil War written for specifically for children, includes a broad range of genres, including fiction, non-fiction, and biographical profiles. </p>  
<p>In 2002 Hill Memorial Library used a selection from this collection for an exhibit, <i>Blue and Gray for Boys and Girls: An Exhibition of Children’s Civil War Literature</i>.  The exhibit was a project of the then United States Civil War Center, and documentation of that exhibition, including photographs and a bibliography are available at <a href="" http://www.lib.lsu.edu/sites/all/files/sc/exhibits/e-exhibits/chlit/home.htm "">the LSU Libraries website</a>. </p>


 
<p>The collection is significant as a unique body of materials reflecting this particular subject, a focus solely on books geared towards a young audience.  Scholars and students interested in the history of reading, children’s literature, historiography, and a host of other topics would find these materials of particular interest, and those who wish to explore a long range view of representations of the Civil War specifically targeted at young American audiences will find this collection invaluable for that purpose. </p>

<p>While the breadth of the collection is impressive in size, span of decades, and its thoroughness, there is another particular draw which makes the collection important for scholars of a different stripe, specifically those looking at the book as “object” – exploring design, publishing history, and the choices made to market books to intended audiences. </p>

<p>Books from around 1880 through about 1910 are especially important, interesting (and collectible!) because of their design, illustrating how the Civil War was graphically portrayed.  This graphic imagery was presented to young people, as well as the adults who most often purchased these books for children as gifts, or for public or school libraries, and represented not only an interest in the war itself, but reflected an interaction with a time that was still tangible and palpable across the United States.  It is certain that these early readers, just fifteen to forty-five years beyond the end of the Civil War, had a personal connection through a grandparent, parent, neighbor, or teacher who served, was wounded, or perhaps died as a result of the Civil War. </p>


<p>The sometimes vivid, sometimes graphic, and sometimes very serious images are an interesting reflection of how books were marketed to a young audience at a particular time and place.  Heroics, action, romance, nationalism, violence, austerity, and more, all have a place on these covers, and it can be imagined that they didn’t just inspire thought, but they inspired a desire to read. </p>
<p>The historian Jim Cullen points out that most of the American public has been exposed to the Civil War not through academic work but through popular culture. Americans continue to be moved by the romanticism and drama of the era, absorbing the Civil War via motion pictures and television mini-series. During the publishers’ bindings era, roughly 1884 – 1930, the Civil War served as the basis for hundreds of novels, poems, songs, humorous writings, and of course, children’s stories. </p>



<p>Children were, in no doubt, excited and inspired by the content of these  books.  While many are illustrated and have brilliant covers, it is the books of the latter part of the 19th century and the first decade of the 20th century that capture the imagination of not only the reader, but of this librarian, who imagines, in an era before comic books, radio, and television, the hours of fascination, thought, leisure time, and expression that were drawn from these book covers alone. </p>  

<p>It is through the generosity and vision of B. Lehman Williamson, who passed away in September of 2015 that this important collection is available in LSU Libraries Special Collections for scholars and students of all ages.  Mr. Williamson’s gift, and his legacy will live on in this growing collection, as the Civil War continues to fascinate readers of all ages.</p>

<h3>A Close Look at America’s Most Infamous Assassin</h3>

<p></p><p>
<br>
<br>
<b>Fortune’s Fool: The Life of John Wilkes Booth</b><br>
by Terry Alford<br>
<b>Publisher:</b> Oxford University Press<br>
<b>Retail Price:</b> $29.95<br>
<b>ISBN:</b>9780195054125<br></p>


<p>Of the 16,000 books and pamphlets written about Abraham Lincoln since his assassination, over 2,000 of them relate to his death and the military trial and execution of the assassins.   Along with Michael W. Kauffman’s <i>American Brutus: John Wilkes Booth and the Lincoln Conspiracies</i> (2004), <i>Fortune’s Fool</i> provides a comprehensive view of Booth.  Clearly enigmatic, his dastardly deed shocked the country.  He was well liked and occasionally lazy.  But at heart, he was obsessed with the Confederacy and its search for independence. </p> 

<p>Alford describes in great breath and detail Booth’s trajectory in finally accepting the fact that the Confederacy was about to end in April 1865.  He sincerely believed that the only chance of its survival was to commit  regicide.  It is a compelling story about a character who once was billed as “the youngest star in the world.” </p>

<p>The author presents fresh revelations about Booth’s early history when he tortured cats as a boy.  One views his peripatetic stage career, involving political extremism and the grisly final hours brought by him and his merry gang including the murder of the president and the severe wounding of the secretary of state, William H. Seward. </p>   

<p>This long awaited biography is the result of Alford’s twenty-five years researching the story in libraries and archives.  He has chased down every detail, myth, and ephemera relating to the assassination.  Far from being an apologist for the assassin, Alford eschews conspiracy theories and presents a scholarly version of Booth, his contemporaries, and the assassination.  He concludes that Booth is repulsive and a murderer.  This was a man who, with a single act, may have postponed for a century any chance of racial reconciliation. </p>

<p>A major reason that Booth supported the Confederate States stemmed from his racism and fear of black political equality.  The author also marginalizes the view of many that the assassin had support from the Confederate government’s leaders.  Arguments continue about the assassination and in that sense explains why the Civil War continues. </p>
<p>This is an outstanding volume that was well worth the wait. </p>

<h3>Lincoln’s Love of Shakespeare</h3>

<p>As an autodidact, Abraham Lincoln enjoyed Shakespeare’s work from an early age and it became a lifelong interest.  After he received the gift of Shakespearian actor James H. Hackett’s book from the author, he wrote back in the midst of the Civil War, on August 17, 1863,</p>

<p><blockquote>Months ago I should have acknowledged the receipt of your book and accompanying kind note; and I now have to beg your pardon for not having done so… .  Some of Shakespeare’s plays I have never read; while others I have gone over perhaps as frequently as any unprofessional reader.  Among the latter are <i>Lear, Richard Third, Henry Eighth, Hamlet</i>, and especially <i>Macbeth</i>.  I think nothing equals <i>Macbeth</i>.  It is wonderful.  Unlike you gentlemen of the profession, I think the soliloquy in <i>Hamlet</i>, commencing ‘Oh, my offence is rank’ surpasses that commencing ‘To be or not to be” (85).</blockquote></p> 

<p>While Lincoln was criticized for his letter (Hackett had leaked it to a newspaper), it certainly confirms his abiding love for the Bard’s work.  He related to it, especially in his roles as President and Commander-in-Chief.  The plays he mentions in his letter to Hackett are tragedies rather than comedies. </p>
<p>With acuity, Walt Whitman wrote, “I would say that what Shakespeare did in poetic expression, Abraham Lincoln essentially did in his personal and official life.”  In getting “Right with Lincoln,” novelists, filmmakers, and playwrights have shown Lincoln quoting Shakespeare.  Michael Anderegg’s book is a welcome entry to the Lincoln bookshelf (some 16,000) as it details Lincoln’s fascination and knowledge of Shakespeare’s plays. </p>

<p>Both Lincoln and Shakespeare were wordsmiths loved language.  And both were fatalists.  Oddly enough, Lincoln would often quote from Shakespeare’s work while visitors or staff were present as is documented in diaries, letters, and newspapers, but he seldom included Shakespearian quotes in his writings. </p>

<p>Anderegg discusses in detail the themes from Shakespeare that resonated so well with the President – Civil War, corruption, illegitimate rule, and ambition.  The author relates how Lincoln became interested in Shakespeare and the plays he read before he became president.  As the nation’s Chief Magistrate, Lincoln had the opportunity to view great Shakespearian actors like Edwin Booth, Charlotte Cushman, Edwin Forrest, in addition to James H. Hackett.  Despite the terrible burden of the presidency, Lincoln took the time to watch Hackett’s performance as Falstaff on several occasions. </p>

<p>This book performs a real service to those interested in Abraham Lincoln, the theater, and William Shakespeare. </p>

6243			Civil War Treasures: <br>Serving Two Masters in the Election of 1876		Rasmussen, Hans			"
<p>As our presidential election ferociously thunders on into the summer and autumn, the uncompromising, partisan nature of modern American politics of which commentators and pundits constantly bemoan continues to cast a depressing cloud of hopelessness over the nation.  But rather than curse the darkness, the LSU Libraries Special Collections prefers to spotlight two treasures that together tell a more hopeful story of civic virtue, a tale of two musicians crossing the political divide during the famously contentious presidential election of 1876.  The competing campaign songs “We'll Blow Our Horn for Hayes” and “Gov. Tilden is Our Man” stand out from the rest of the political music of the time not just because they were issued by the same publisher and purchased from the same New Orleans music store, but because both songs were written and composed <i>by the same guys!</i><sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Until the mid-twentieth century, music specially written to honor candidates was a staple of presidential campaigns, and the election of 1876 certainly was no exception.  Its most prolific lyricist was Samuel N. Mitchell (1846-1905), an extraordinarily productive (if poorly remunerated) songwriter during the 1870s who became famous for writing sentimental ballads, especially the tremendously popular <a href=""https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/handle/1774.2/5174"">“Just Touch the Harp Gently, My Pretty Louise”</a> (1870).  A veteran of the 11th Rhode Island Infantry Regiment during the Civil War, Mitchell ultimately penned some 600 songs in his lifetime, including <a href=""http://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/uva-lib:1139890/view"">“We Deck Their Graves Alike Today”</a> (1877), which became a standard hymn for Memorial Day ceremonies.<sup>2</sup>  He wrote the lyrics to five songs for the election of 1876: three honoring Rutherford B. Hayes and two celebrating Samuel J. Tilden.  Mitchell was joined on three of these by the equally ambivalent composer Charles Edward Prior (1856-1927), an amateur musician from Jewett City, Connecticut, who at the time was employed primarily as a bookkeeper and paymaster for a cotton goods manufacturer and as an organist at the local Congregational Church.<sup>3</sup></p>

<p>Bouncing, boisterous, but never particularly creative, these Mitchell and Prior collaborations aimed to rally the troops with cheers for the candidate’s impeccable character and enthusiastic (if decidedly unspecific) predictions of success when in office.  Their tunes for Hayes both celebrated the general’s war record and encouraged Republicans to get voters to the polls.  <a href=""https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/handle/1774.2/16435"">“Hayes and Wheeler are Our Choice”</a> tried to quell any doubts among the faithful because “Hayes and Wheeler are a team, That will be hard to beat, And folly ‘tis to even dream, Or think of their defeat.”<sup>4</sup>  <a href=""https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/handle/1774.2/12397"">“We’ll Blow Our Horn for Hayes”</a> became quite a popular piece that reportedly sold 1,700 copies in three days, notwithstanding its rather flat lyrics and drinking song chorus: “We’ll give our votes to Rutherford, We’ll blow our horn for Hayes, And in the White House he will live A portion of his days.”<sup>5</sup>  <a href=""https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/handle/1774.2/6470"">“Gov. Tilden is Our Man”</a> likewise strove to inspire Democratic supporters with bland character affirmations (“Gov’nor Tilden has a mind of the good old fashioned kind”) and broad campaign promises (“He will put an end to ‘rings’ and the other naughty things, That cast such dreadful shame upon the land”).<sup>6</sup></p>

<p>Samuel Mitchell teamed up with other composers for two more campaign songs in 1876.  <a href=""https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/handle/1774.2/10853"">“The Boys in Blue Will See It Through,”</a> which we wrote with Hart P. Danks, apparently sought the votes of Union veterans despite making only the vaguest of references to the Civil War.  Here only the Democrats were the enemy and they would be defeated by good soldiers from all the sections of the nation: “The North and South, the East and West Will rally to the front, And all will do their very best To make the ‘Demmies’ grunt.”<sup>7</sup>  <a href=""https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/handle/1774.2/18929"">“The Times Are Sadly Out of Joint,”</a> which Mitchell wrote with composer H.A. Selington, clearly was his most creative work of the campaign with a message of class struggle that outshone his usual party fight song repertoire.  A pro-Tilden ballad emphasizing the suffering of the poor during the Panic of 1873, it cut at the Republicans with references to Grant-era corruption while waxing in selective (albeit apologetic) nostalgia for William “Boss” Tweed, at the time a prison escapee and fugitive from the law: “Now that the old man’s on the wing, We state this as quite sure, Though he was boss of a bad ring, He did not hate the poor.”<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>So why did these two men compose for both sides in the election?  In a word—money.  Mitchell complained into middle age of how little he made from his songs and how others profited handsomely from them, estimating he earned no more than $7,000 from all his 600 works while others grew rich, even by outright theft.  By his mid-forties he was reduced to working as a mailing clerk for the <i>Pawtucket Evening Times</i>, resigned never to write ballads again.  Although Prior would go on to a successful career in banking and fame as a compiler of Sunday School singing books, in 1876 he was twenty years old and struggling as a bookkeeper and church organist with a new bride to support.  Whatever their personal political views—Prior later would describe himself ironically as “a Republican with independent tendencies”—the need to support themselves and their families clearly settled any qualms over party loyalty, creative contradiction, or the naggings of conscience.<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>While nineteenth-century journalism infamously exhibited a bald-faced partisanship, political songwriting apparently was a more mercenary endeavor.  After all, Mitchell and Prior were not the only songwriters playing for both teams during the 1876 election.  The German-born composer Edward Mack wrote four marches for Hayes and one for Tilden.  A musician named R. Goerdeler likewise wrote marches for both candidates.  Phil P. Keil arranged the “Tilden and Hendricks Polka,” as well as writing the music for the “Hayes and Wheeler Polka.”<sup>10</sup>  Samuel Mitchell’s sometime collaborator, Hart P. Danks, showed a Republican partiality by writing songs for Grant, Hayes, Harrison, and the Union dead, but he broke ranks to compose for Winfield Scott Hancock in 1880, proving that even seemingly loyal musicians could be lured away for ready cash.<sup>11</sup></p>
<p>Mitchell and Prior paired up one other time that year for “If Washington Was Living Now,” a positively painful song for the nation’s centennial that was panned for being too hokey even for its time.  After quoting some of its awful verse imagining the first president approving modern American progress, one reviewer complained, “The writer of this is probably not a poet highly gifted with fancy and imagination, but he is able to rhyme … He merely ground out his verses; and as his mill was a poor one, the verses were not only without feeling, but in ridiculously bad taste, not to say nonsensical.”<sup>12</sup>  In the end, the election of 1876 would be the only campaign to inspire the mediocre words and melodies of these two decidedly independent musicians.  Neither Samuel Mitchell nor Charles Prior ever wrote another presidential campaign song again.</p>

<p>Of the more than 16,000 books about Abraham Lincoln, none touch a more responsive chord than these which extract his words. </p>  
<p>The publisher provides readers a large and gorgeous book consisting of more than 100 selections with nearly 200 illustrations – most in color – including photographs, lithographs, and paintings.  Though the selections are all from the nine volumes of <i>The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln</i>, the fact that they were picked by two eminent Lincoln scholars who add superb and substantive annotations ranks this volume among the best. </p> 
<p>The book highlights Abraham Lincoln’s unique role in the development of the United States.  He transformed the nation.  His empathy, resilience, and effectiveness shine through these selections.  They are a reflection of his depth. </p>  
<p>This book spans 30 years of Abraham Lincoln’s life – from his first political campaign for the state legislature in 1832 to his final speech on Reconstruction on April 12, 1865.  Both personal and political letters, his poetry, speeches, presidential messages and proclamations greet us at every turn.  The annotations give us Lincoln’s thoughts on secession, civil liberties in wartime, slavery, emancipation and the suffering endured by the people – North as well as South. </p>  
<p>The editors’ commentary runs side by side with the text of Lincoln’s words.  A pragmatic, political, realistic Lincoln emerges rather than, as William Safire complained, “A votive candle on a shelf.”  For example, one sees this in his comments to the people of Charleston, Illinois during the Lincoln-Douglas debates, “I have never seen to my knowledge a man, woman, or child who was in favor of producing a perfect equality, social and political, between Negroes and white men.” </p>  
<p>We see the President and Commander-in-Chief struggling with the great challenges that any Chief Magistrate would have to confront.  With the challenges came both disingenuousness and humor.  Lincoln was not afraid to use humor at the expense of his enemies but Lincoln eventually practiced the politics of inclusion and became very effective in making dissidents his friends or, at least, bringing them around to his policies. </p>  
<p>One wishes that there were more selections. </p>
<p>What could be better than Abraham Lincoln’s words supplemented by informed and elegant writing about them? </p>
<p>This book is not only for students of Lincoln, but for all readers who enjoy good writing.  All of this brings Abraham Lincoln’s writings to a much more comprehensive appreciation of his thoughts and life. </p>

6309			Civil War Treasures: <br>English Satire on the American Civil War from the Pages of <i>Punch</i>		Rasmussen, Hans	Taylor, Michael		"
<p><i>Punch, or the London Charivari</i>, a justly famous British weekly satirical magazine established in 1841, had become a national institution by the time the American Civil War began.  Its brilliant writers and cartoonists naturally made sport of the politics of the war, casting their witty and disparaging opinions on issues like slavery, secession, Anglo-American diplomacy, wartime economics, and Union fortunes on the battlefield.  The LSU Libraries Special Collections holds original issues of <i>Punch</i> for the years 1861-1863, affording an amusing glimpse of how English opinion makers interpreted and encouraged others to view the American Civil War.
<p>Even before the war began, the writers of <i>Punch</i> were positively prescient about its outcome.  As soon as South Carolina seceded from the union, they predicted that a war begun to preserve slavery would counterintuitively result in emancipation, a viewpoint expressed in the opening lines of a satirical poem:</p>

<blockquote>
Secede, ye Southern States, secede,<br/>
No better plan could be,<br/>
If you of Niggers would be freed,<br/>
To set your Niggers free.<sup>1</sup></blockquote>

<p>Their bafflement over why southerners would leave the union and foolishly forfeit the benefit of the fugitive slave act commenced the magazine’s wholehearted condemnation of slavery in the South, a position consistent with the majority opinion in Britain.  Their abolitionist attitude dominated all references to American politics before the war, such as a particularly biting ditty sung to the tune of <i>Rule Britannia</i> that ended each stanza with “Rule Slaveownia, Slaveownia rules, and raves / “Christians ever, ever, ever shall have slaves.”<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Once hostilities began, however, the thrust of <i>Punch’s</i> satire switched from condemning slavery to ridiculing the United States, whose earlier pretensions of international ambition, expressed particularly through the Monroe Doctrine, had completely disintegrated owing to its current troubles.  For instance, one song published barely a fortnight after Fort Sumter snickered at the nation’s inability to answer Spanish colonial encroachment in Santo Domingo.  Another a month later laughed at the folly of engaging in a civil war and ridiculed the poor judgment of the American people:</p>

<blockquote>
And here you are about to fight,<br/>
And wage intestine war,<br/>
Not either of you in the right:<br/>
What simpletons you are!<sup>3</sup></blockquote>

<p><i>Punch</i> didn’t hesitate to mock the Yankees after their resounding defeat at First Manassas, publishing a ten stanza poem and full-page cartoon using the defeat as proof of the feebleness of the claim that the Unites States might seize Canada out of anger over Britain’s official declaration of neutrality in May 1861.  In subsequent months, they scoffed at the idea that Britons would loan money to the United States to put down the rebellion: “You’ll spend all you borrow in powder and ball, / And then have to show for it—nothing at all.”  A cartoon later that year suggested British textile manufacturers would buy cotton from India if they couldn’t get any from the United States, depicting a frustrated John Bull angrily declaring, “Oh! If you two like fighting better than business, I shall deal at the other shop.”<sup>4</sup></p>

<p>Not surprisingly, the Trent Affair of November-December 1861 evoked passionate scorn from patriotic English satirists:</p>

<blockquote>
Your passion and arrogance, JONATHAN, bridle,<br/>
And let me know what you call MASON and SLIDELL.<br/>
Are they rebels?  What right, if you take that position,<br/>
Had you, boarding the <i>Trent</i>, to demand extradition?</blockquote>

<p>They turned the tables by interrogating if the Americans would have objected if Britain had seized John Mitchel and Thomas Francis Meagher, two escaped Irish revolutionaries then living in the United States.<sup>5</sup> Several cartoons  illustrated the anxiety over the possibility for war between the two countries before the crisis was resolved, as well as the smugness felt over this British diplomatic victory.  A song sung to the tune of <i>Yankee Doodle</i> expressed this joy at bettering an upstart nation in a tight predicament: </p>

<blockquote>
ROWDY DOODLE is in wrath,<br/>
And would on us have poured it;<br/>
But war’s so dear a luxury,<br/>
He can’t just now afford it.<br/>
He owns that he would much enjoy<br/>
The Britishers to lick, Sir:<br/>
But now, alas! He’s so hard up,<br/>
He cannot buy the stick,Sir!<sup>6</sup></blockquote>

<p>Once the Trent Affair had passed, <i>Punch’s</i> satirical aim returned to a broad ridicule of the war’s political, moral, and especially economic futility, as well as a mockery of Lincoln’s inability to crush the rebellion in the months before Antietam.<sup>7</sup>  The Emancipation Proclamation, rather than being welcomed as a long-awaited instrument of liberation, was satirized in cartoon and verse as “Abe Lincoln’s Last Card,” a desperate measure that failed to meet Britons’ hopes for truly national emancipation:</p>

<blockquote>
From the Slaves of Southern rebels<br/>
Thus I strike the chain:<br/>
But the slaves of loyal owners<br/>
Still shall slaves remain.<sup>8</sup></blockquote>

<p>Lincoln’s quandary over how to deal with the tenacious issue of slavery that had challenged every previous president wasn’t lost on <i>Punch</i>, who well knew of previous ideas and schemes for abolition that had failed in the United States.  The Emancipation Proclamation’s inability to actually free slaves in rebellious states and the dilemma of continued enslavement in the “Border States, that’s neither flesh nor fish” all conspired to paint a picture of a ridiculously weak and ineffective president in early 1863.<sup>9</sup>  Despite these shortcomings in the Union’s conduct of the war, <i>Punch</i> approved of arming freedmen and condemned the New York City draft riots of 1863.<sup>10</sup></p>



<p>Whatever its opinion of Americans north or south, <i>Punch’s</i> writers and artists never made an issue of British neutrality, decidedly insisting that Britons wanted no part in the American war.  Although they never ceased in their principled sympathy for slaves and freedmen, the Civil War was also critically an economic issue, a matter of grain imports, loans, investments, and the cotton trade.  Thus, they imagined John Bull as a merchant explaining “to his American bullies” that “Into your confounded quarrel / Let myself be dragged I’ll not,” because “What I want to do with either / Is impartially to trade.”<sup>11</sup>  Mid-Victorian Britain was a manufacturing dynamo for which the American Civil War proved to be only a nonsensical nuisance.<br/></p>
