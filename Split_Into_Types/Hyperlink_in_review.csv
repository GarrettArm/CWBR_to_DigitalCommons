<b>CWBR:</b>  I’m here today with Professor Christian G. Samito, author of <i>Becoming American Under Fire: Irish Americans, African Americans, and the Politics of Citizenship during the Civil War Era</i>.  Professor Samito, thank you for joining me.</p>
<p> 
<b>Christian G. Samito (CS):</b> My pleasure.</p>
<p>
<b>CWBR:</b> How did you decide to focus this study on African Americans and Irish Americans?</p>
<p>
<b>CS:</b>  Well I think that they are two interesting groups because in the 1850s they really are at the heart of the debate regarding national citizenship and who are the American people.  African Americans are excluded completely from national citizenship by the Dred Scott decision.  And with Irish Americans, Irish immigrants are able to naturalize but there's some real question as to what that means in the law because national citizenship is so vaguely defined in the 1850s.  And then the other issue is nativism; there's a lot of people who are native-born Americans who question whether Irish immigrants can fully integrate and become a part of the American people.  So the Irish Americans and the African Americans are two separate populations but I think they are at the heart of this debate in the 1850s as to who comprises the American people and things like that.  They both have interesting wartime experiences with some similarities, not all that many, but there is still some interesting issues.  For instance, two groups of people now realizing an American allegiance, they're strengthening an American allegiance, and then both groups are at the heart of the redefinition of citizenship that takes place after the Civil War.  And they're not necessarily working in conjunction, but their activism together helps to redefine national citizenship: African Americans in terms of some issues, Irish Americans in terms of other issues.  When you look at the aggregate it’s a new definition of American citizenship that comes out of the early years of Reconstruction and African Americans and Irish Americans are right at the heart of that and it makes a lot of sense to look at them together during this time period. </p>
<p>
<b>CWBR:</b> With that in mind, would you consider the American Civil War as a watershed for citizenship and, as some scholars have suggested, the second American Revolution?</p>
<p>
<b>CS:</b>  I definitely think it’s a watershed for the history of American citizenship.  I mean the bottom line is in the 1850s, and even preceding that all through the pre-Civil War period, national citizenship was very vaguely defined and the fact of the matter is that most rights and privileges that we today associate with national citizenship were governed by the state.  And their decisions were based on a lot of different issues such as race and whether one was a native-born citizen or a naturalized citizen or things like that.  From the Civil War moment comes a completely different concept of national citizenship.  It's more important, rights start to be associated with it, there really becomes no distinction between being a naturalized citizen and a native-born citizen, save the constitutional one that you have to have been born in the United States to run for President and therefore Vice President.  As far as the Civil War being a second American Revolution, I think that’s a little bit more complicated of an issue.  I certainly think that the Civil War is critically important in American history.  It affects just about every facet of American life and government in some way and the American people really make critical choices during this time period that help create the United States that we know today.  I think, in some respect, the choices go back and affirm the principle of the first American Revolution and bring to fruition some of the ideals of the founders that still took some time to come to fruition.  But yeah I do think that was a huge break in some respect certainly in citizenship.  The developments in citizenship were a revolutionary moment so yeah it's a critically important watershed event in American history.</p>
<p> 
<b>CWBR:</b> You mention the Irish American apathy to the plight of the African American on a personal level.  What were Irish Americans saying about slavery in the 1850s?</p>
<p>
<b>CS:</b>  Well frankly, some Irish American leaders were apologists for slavery.  When you look at some of their writings especially Mitchell and people like that, some were apologists for slavery.  Other Irish American leaders turned a blind eye to it and I think it's a complicated nuanced history.  A lot of Irish Americans in northern cities were on the very low rungs of the socioeconomic ladder and the idea of emancipating slaves who might then come north and compete for jobs was a scary prospect for them. And so you had a lot of animosity between much of the Irish American community and much of the African American community in the urban North in a sense of competition both for jobs and also jostling on the low rungs of the social ladder.  And some of the ethnic leaders were making apologies for slavery so there certainly wasn't a large abolitionist component among Irish Americans.  Interestingly though, abolition was somewhat popular in Ireland and you can look at Irish leaders like O’Connell who did urge abolition of slavery and urged for greater human rights, including for blacks held in bondage. </p>
<p>
<b>CWBR:</b> Given the tradition of symbolic Irish nationalist leaders like, in the twentieth century, Patrick Henry Pearse and Michael Collins in Irish history, how important were military leaders like Thomas Meagher and Peter Welsh to the fight for and attainment of citizenship?</p>
<p>
<b>CS:</b>   I think they were very important.  When you look at Thomas Meagher and you look at figures such as Corcoran they really place their Civil War service and the Civil War service of Irish Americans at the heart of this new call that they belong in the American people.  And one of the elements of nativism was this idea that Irish immigrants would not be able to embrace the ideals of the American republic.  And early on, as soon as the war starts and Irish Americans start enlisting, you see speeches from Thomas Francis Meagher, a book published by Corcoran, letters home from people like Guiney (Patrick Robert Guiney) talking about the idea that this military service on the part of Irish Americans was vanquishing nativism and that proving that Irish Americans can still respect and embrace their ethnic identity but also be good American citizens and embrace the values of the republic.  And, in fact, that Irish Americans wanted to get those values in place in Ireland as well basically, not that we're as Irish Americans rejecting the values of American republicanism, but as Irish Americans we want to see those values in place in Ireland as well.  Now it’s interesting that you bring up Peter Welsh because he wasn't an ethnic leader; he was a carpenter living in New York who enlisted in a Massachusetts regiment.  What's fascinating with him is that you see in some letters home, and letters to his father-in-law where he is justifying his decision to enlist, he’s making some of the same arguments that the ethnic leaders are and he really seems to have embraced this idea that he’s serving, not only to help Ireland, and he’s serving, not only because the Union is a refuge for Irish immigrants, but also because the Union has to survive for republicanism worldwide to survive including hope for Ireland.  So it’s a very nuanced situation where Irish Americans are placing their service, saying hey by defending the Union we're also helping Ireland but we're also affirming our citizenship status here in the United States and we're also vanquishing nativism by showing that, yes we may be Irish and we may be Catholic, but we can also be good American citizens and defenders of American values and American constitutionalism.  The military service really does lie at the heart of the Irish American argument that helps diminish nativism in the years following the Civil War.</p>
<p> 
<b>CWBR:</b>  Turning attention to the African American experience, Richard Slotkin has recently written about the racial violence that resulted from the enlistment of African American soldiers.  After this enlistment, what role did race play in the war, especially at places like Fort Pillow and the battle of the Crater at Petersburg and how did African American soldiers change the war psychologically and ideologically?</p>
<p>
<b>CS:</b>  Well I think the African American experience really involves fighting on two fronts.  One is the military battlefield and then the other is the battle for equal rights and again, as soon as they're enlisting, African Americans are making the call for equal rights.  As far as combat performance there are moments showing that African Americans are equal in manhood and in combat abilities.  We see that it is probably most popularly depicted in the assault of fort Wagner in the movie Glory, in battles like Olustee in Florida and places like that so it really contradicts this idea that African Americans are children or are somehow inferior.  Against them, however, you see a lot of prejudice you see some prejudice in the American, in the Union army, you see some atrocities committed, such as your reference at Fort Pillow; you also have issues though where blacks contest unequal treatment.  The first civil rights victory won by black leadership and black protests is the unequal pay controversy which involves African American soldiers being paid less than their white counterparts and many blacks refused to accept any pay if it's going to be unequal to that of whites.  Massachusetts, for its regiments, the Massachusetts state house the legislature in Boston decides to appropriate money from the state to equalize pay and members of the 54th and 55th Massachusetts say: no we're not going to accept state pay because that's acknowledging a distinction, and so blacks lead a protest; sometimes it turns violent and involves some mutinies, a lot of discontent among the African American core, and it reaches the ears of Congress and eventually Congress comes around to equalize pay for African American soldiers.  And in other instances African American soldiers claim equality and say: we are no longer slaves, we are now freemen; we are fighting in the Union.  And that certainly percolates in the Reconstruction experience where now you have tens of thousands of black veterans who have experienced military service who have helped fight, not just for the Union, but also for the death of slavery, certainly a very powerful position, and it really leads into the call for equal rights and really defines citizenship.  And African Americans say: we don't just want freedom in name only, we want a freedom that actually means something, an enduring freedom with rights and the ability to participate in the economic life of the nation and the right to vote in elections and participate in the decision-making process of the republic.</p>
<p> 
<b>CWBR:</b> Do you think then that we can find origins of the civil rights movement in the Civil War?  You alluded to the unequal pay protest.  Would you suggest that some of those challenges and moments where they stood up for themselves played a role in sort of the early foundations of the civil rights movement following the war?</p>
<p>
<b>CS:</b>  Definitely, I think it operates on two levels, one is the theoretical level.  A lot of the arguments of the second civil rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s mirror the arguments that were made in the 1860s and 1870s so I think on a theoretical level certainly.  I think in terms of legal change a lot of the second civil rights movement was trying to get practical enjoyment of the rights won during the 1860s.  And then I also think on a personal level that African Americans held a candle against the darkness of Jim Crow and what I mean by that is African Americans in the 1890s and 1900s remembered the potential that took place during the 1860s and remembered the successes that took place in the 1860s where you had black legislators and black judges.  One of the justices on the South Carolina Supreme Court was African American.  You had African Americans serving in Congress and I think that the memory of that continued on over the decades.  And then, of course, the other thing that’s interesting there’s another parallel that both civil rights movements really come out of the wartime experience.  I mean when you look at the civil rights movement of the 1900s really turns into a mass movement coming out of World War II and the Korean War and the civil rights movement of the 1860s is coming obviously after the Civil War and black military participation there and so I think that there’s a parallel: two civil rights movements that really are sparked by black participation in war.</p>
<p>
<b>CWBR:</b> On Pages 112-113, you discuss Charles G. Halpine who became a leader in showing the democratic and Americanizing principles of the army to the Irish American community, even writing a song that the Grand Army of the Republic later adopted in the 1880s.  Was the army as an avenue to citizenship, in Halpine’s eyes, exclusive to white Americans?</p>
<p>
<b>CS:</b>  He was certainly a war Democrat and a lot of the war Democrats still didn't have a very egalitarian sense of African American inclusion.  And a lot of the war Democrats certainly weren't fighting for emancipation and for African Americans.  Having said that, it is interesting that you do find some Irish Americans undergoing conversions to become true Republicans.  Patrick Robert Guiney is an Irish-born Colonel who starts off the war as a Democrat when he enlists but he becomes a Republican and he really does become a Republican.  In his letters to his wife you see that he really has some respect for African Americans in promoting abolition.  And you see sometimes in early regimentals written by Irish Americans sometimes laughing a little bit at slaves they encounter in the South but also feeling bad for their experience and saying that emancipation was right and that no man should be in bondage.  And you even had some, its fascinating, you actually had some Irish Americans come around to want to serve as officers in the United States Colored Troops, which was the name of the corps of the African American soldiers, and certainly some of them wanted to have commissions and get out of the ranks in their regiments and have an officers commission.  But when you look at some of them, some of the letters and petitions, where they're saying: you know we would like to participate, they want to participate to help African Americans and after the war you actually see some moment of fluctuation where some Irish Americans do start to embrace the Republican agenda of broader human rights including for African Americans.  I mean not to put too broad of a stroke on it, and say that masses of Irish Americans are suddenly embracing the idea of equal rights for African Americans, but there’s certainly some fluctuation in Irish American hostility to the Republican agenda.</p>
<p> 
<b>CWBR:</b>  After the war, what role did Irish American citizenship play in the development of international naturalization and citizenship protocols?</p>
<p>
<b>CS:</b>  Well what happens is you have this situation where Britain adheres to a doctrine called perpetual allegiance and under perpetual allegiance if you're born a subject of Britain no act that you do can change the allegiance, that you’re always a subject to the Crown.  So, in other words, if you were born in Ireland and you travel to the United States and you naturalize in the United States, when you go back to Britain, Britain would look at you as a British subject not an American naturalized citizen.  What happens is the Irish nationalist movement, the Fenian Brotherhood, stars agitating after the Civil War.  Some Fenians go to Ireland, other Fenians invade Canada, and Britain starts making arrests and charging people as British subjects and some of them are not only Union war veterans but naturalized American citizens.  Well this creates widespread protests in the United States and what’s interesting is that it’s not just protest by Irish Americans but native-born Americans also join in.  And they call, in these protests and petitions to Congress; they call for the United States to defend American citizenship rights and the idea of expatriation rights.  And what expatriation rights were is the right to change your allegiance; its the right to immigrate and if you can find a country that will naturalize you, you can change your allegiance.  And in these waves of agitation, these mass meetings all across the country, in cities like Boston and New York and small towns, both Congress and the state department are pressured to pressure Britain to change its policy.  And eventually Britain does just that, eventually after tensions are very high and it’s in the context of other tensions, the Alabama claims and things like that, Britain agrees to move away from the doctrine of perpetual allegiance and to honor expatriation rights and naturalization.  So it actually does have a tremendous impact in international affairs where Britain abandons its centuries-old policy on naturalization and whether subjects could naturalize abroad.</p>
<p>
<b>CWBR:</b>  After the war, in the years following the conflict, how did Irish and African American experiences with the struggle for citizenship differ?</p>
<p>
<b>CS:</b>  Well I think on the biggest level African Americans are, in an initial matter, asking to be able to become citizens whereas naturalization was always open to Irish Americans.  African Americans are more concerned with gaining some level of rights and equality with whites; Irish Americans are more concerned with some of the identity aspects of citizenship, of being able to belong in the United States, and eliminating nativism and then they're more concerned with issues like this: being protected by the United States as naturalized citizens when they go abroad.  So Irish Americans aren't as concerned about parsing out the actual elements of citizenship or what rights are included in national citizenship, African Americans are because African Americans are calling for national citizenship that means something because they realize eventually the Republicans realize if you continue to let citizenship rights remain the province of the states some states are going to discriminate against blacks and not give equal rights.  So you get a moment where national citizenship starts to take primacy with the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and in the Civil Rights Act of 1866 it's defined that anyone born in the United States ,whether black or white, is a national citizen and as a national citizen they're entitled to certain rights and then it progresses from there you get the Fourteenth Amendment and things like that.  So African Americans are more concerned with the actual definition of what rights are included in national citizenship, you know, A: that they are national citizens and B: what that includes.  Irish Americans are more concerned with equalizing naturalized citizenship and more concerned with being protected when they go abroad as naturalized citizens.</p>
<p>
<b>CWBR:</b> Did the federal government fail, then, to follow through on civil rights following the Civil War?  Why do we see the backlash, especially against African Americans, during and after Reconstruction?</p>
<p>
<b>CS:</b>  Well you know that question really is: what caused the death of Reconstruction and I think it's a number of things.  I think a little bit is naivety and what I mean by that is thinking that southerners would not have as much of a backlash as they had to the idea of equal rights for blacks.  I think part of it is that the army demobilizes very quickly so you don't have a lot of troops in the South to be able to put down the Ku Klux Klan.  A lot of the branch of the armed services that would be best-suited for fighting the Klan, the Calvary, isn't really stationed in the South; it's stationed now in the western frontier in the last wave of the wars against the Native Americans.  And I think a lot of it is simply exhaustion.  By the 1870s we have a United States that dealt with the tensions of the 1850s, the bloodshed and destruction of the Civil War, the turmoil of Reconstruction during the second half of the 1860s, and by the early 1870s, they think a lot of northerners, even some Republicans, the liberal Republicans, are simply getting exhausted and saying: we've given blacks national citizenship, we've given them the right to vote, they need to start being able to defend themselves.  And there was an unwillingness to go through expanding the army and paying for an expansion in the army and things like that to really combat the realities that were going on in the South and the violence of southern white racism.  And I think what it really was, was a sense of exhaustion that grew in the North to finally start turning a blind eye to what was going on in the South.  They also had other turmoil, you have to remember, as the 1870s go on, labor starts to become the big issue.  If the 1860s are defined by issues of race, I think the 1870s are defined by issues of labor and strikes and violence like that and fear of socialism.  Concerns like that start to take more and more center stage and the race issue starts to diminish.  And certainly a lot of Republicans who are still very passionate about the issue, but they're eventually going to lose out and become subsumed and then eventually you get the rise of Jim Crow and by the turn of the century the promise of those laws and the promise of all that legal change they're still on the books but not being able to be enjoyed and practiced by the African Americans.</p>

<p><i><b>Civil War Book Review (CWBR)</i>:</b> Today, <i>Civil War Book Review</i> is proud to speak with Adam Arenson, Professor of History at University of Texas at El Paso about his recent work, <i>The Great Heart of the Republic: St. Louis and the Cultural Civil War</i>.  Professor Arenson, I appreciate you taking the time to speak with us.</p>
<p>
<b>Adam Arenson (AA):</b> It’s my pleasure</p>
<p>
<i><b>CWBR</i>:</b> I was struck by your timeline.  How did you decide to begin your narrative in the 1840s and conclude with the St. Louis World’s Fair and Olympic Games in 1904?</p>
<p><b>AA:</b> I found that they actually match very well with these national events that we often think of as the beginning and ending of the Civil War era: the end of the U.S. war with Mexico in 1848 and the Tilden-Hayes Election that is over with the semi-compromise of 1877.  It was fascinating to see how these local and national events were in conversation, for example, the fire in 1849.  That’s a random event; in May 1849 there is a spark that catches from one steamboat to another and burns down a lot of downtown in St. Louis.  But that turns out to be a great thing for the merchants of St. Louis because they are able to change their trade patterns from being about a North-South trade to New Orleans and old French patterns into a new East-West trade that takes advantage of their new position as a gateway to the West.  Similarly, with Forest Park, the fact that Governor Tilden of New York is in St. Louis in 1876 to be named the Democratic national nominee at the National Convention, that fact that they take a break from that convention to go out and dedicate Forest Park, I think it tied together these two moments where the national conversation is shifting very dramatically and the fact that both the Tilden-Hayes Election and the election to split the city and county of St. Louis end up very contested.  There is a lot of discussion of fraud and they are basically both decided by extra-electoral decision making, that was another thing that helped me to see that these events could be tied together and help close the story.</p>
<p><i><b>CWBR</i>:</b> You discussed how insurance policies helped businessmen and women rebuild St. Louis after the great fire of 1849, describing the fire as their opportunity to start anew. How common were insurance policies during the period and how significantly did the decision to purchase insurance on one’s business and inventory play into the rebuilding of St. Louis?</p>
<p><b>AA:</b> What I found was that, right at the top or northern part of the waterfront, what you have is a number of the city’s most wealthy individuals.  They’re French fur-trading families and they have a lot of investments in various places and I think, because they were well-connected to other trading centers, to the uncertainties of the steamboat trade, and to the fur trade rendezvous, they seemed to be better connected to the insurance markets.  My analysis shows that, on the southern part of the fire, that was the area where it was more working-class, in modern terms.  And those individuals, not only were they not able to save their belongings, because the whole city had rushed to save the northern part of the city, but they also were not people who were insured.  And that area is emptied out, not because they’re able to rebuild with insurance money, but because they have to go live with relatives or other people.  So, there’s two sets of change happening along the river: the northern part that is able to capitalize on the fact of the fire and the southern part who are really victims of it.  And so it was interesting to see these two effects of the fire right in two different neighborhoods along the riverfront. </p> 
<p><i><b>CWBR</i>:</b> It seemed to me that Thomas Hart Benton had a pretty firm grasp on the future and he understood the consequences of politics and the future of slavery?  How was this insight possible and what did it mean for his career?</p>

<p><b>AA:</b> Benton was born in North Carolina but at an early age he had moved west and he saw a rise of the West as the thing that would raise his fortunes in the country.  He was instrumental in the statehood debate and the Missouri Compromise that allowed Missouri to join as a state and then, from 1821, he was in the U.S. Senate representing Missouri and what he understood was the interest of the greater West.  The introduction of the book talks about the three sides of the Civil War and this effort to see North, South, and West, not just North and South.  That is something that Benton really exemplifies along with a lot of other figures who we often think of as being on opposite sides: people like Abraham Lincoln, Jefferson Davis, and Henry Clay.  Some of them ended up in different political parties but there is kind of a western agenda that all of them are pushing, thinking that the railroad, if it reaches out, first if they gain the continent, as they do in 1848 and then, once they can reach the Pacific, once they build that railroad, the politics, economics, and culture of the country will change pretty dramatically because of the differences in the West.  They’re not so worried about slavery; they’re not so worried about tariffs and some of these eastern concerns because they think, once the mining riches of the West and the natural riches of the West, and certain other interests out on the Pacific become the center of national attention, then the West will really rise and these eastern concerns will matter a lot less.  I think Benton is probably the person in American history who embodies that in one of the most powerful ways, especially for a politician rather than someone who is an adventurer, someone like Kit Carson.</p>
<p><i><b>CWBR</i>:</b> How did city leaders reconcile their desire that St. Louis be a beacon for growth, progress, and the American ideal in the future with the fact that immigrants from Europe were flooding the city and fueling this growth in the first place?  Was St. Louis another “city on a hill?”</p>

<p><b>AA:</b> This is another area where the unusual demographics of St. Louis play in.  It’s a city that has a large northern population and also a growing German population who are often free labor, free soil advocates, yet it’s a large city on the border of slavery and freedom in a slave state, in this exceptional geographic location of Missouri after the Missouri Compromise.  And so you have individuals from all of the different communities investing in the railroad; you have French fur-trading families who often held slaves investing in the railroad.  You have the Germans; you have those from the Northeast.  And part of what they thought is, like we can see later with Stephen Douglas and the Kansas-Nebraska Act, is that they saw the building of the railroad as linked to something that would dramatically change the way that slavery would function.  And so I see some of their support for popular sovereignty-the idea that, as you move into the territory, the people of the territory themselves will determine if slavery is necessary or not-I think that they see that, as railroads are this transformative technology, they’re going to change the reality of living in these communities and only then will we know if slavery needs to continue or not.  Looking back, we know that’s a little optimistic, that slavery was a little more entrenched than they seemed to believe, but I think that really motivated their policy; they really thought the railroad would solve all.</p>
<p><i><b>CWBR</i>:</b> How were the slavery debates problematic for the supporters of the Transcontinental Railroad in St. Louis?  Was this an indication that some semblance of unity is necessary to achieve national goals?</p>
<p><b>AA:</b> There’s definitely language that puts forth St. Louis as this great national city, this place that the whole country should look to.  The most prominent moment where that happens is the founding of Washington University as this national, non-sectarian, non-political driven place that would be a beacon to education in the country.  They talk of themselves as being the Harvard or Yale of the West, two years after they’re founded, before they even have a building.  Later, during Reconstruction, there’s also an effort to move the national capital to St. Louis and they think that’s, among other things, a nice gesture of sectional reconciliation.  It will be in a place that is North, South, and West and not in Washington which they see as peripheral to the newly continental nation.  So there are definitely ways in which St. Louis is trying to put forward itself as a global city.  One of the pamphlets that’s written for the Capital Removal Campaign, is called “St. Louis: The Future Great City of the World” and so they are very much embracing the German immigrants, the Irish immigrants, and others as coming to a city that’s on the rise, that they’re willing to take the best of the world and make it into what they see as the promise of the United States for the whole continent and then trade with the world as well.  </p>
<p><i><b>CWBR</i>:</b> On Page 138 you make the statement that “Missouri’s condition was so stable that the principles for postwar government could already be considered in June 1862.”  What, if anything, did President Lincoln and his administration learn from their experiences in St. Louis?</p>
<p><b>AA:</b> What you see in St. Louis is, in May 1861 there is a skirmish at Camp Jackson as the Confederate-leaning state militia gather and then Union troops, along with a number of German volunteers, surround them and get them to surrender.  That’s really the only kind of battle in St. Louis.  What you see after that is the building of gunboats, the training of troops, including lots of U.S. Colored Troops, the caring for wounded and refugees from both sides, as well as new schools for African Americans, and a pretty strong presence for the Provost Marshall to keep the Confederate sympathizers at bay, but also not to expel them, not to remove them from the economy.  So I think that balancing act, that effort to make sure the city is still a place of North, South, and West is what makes it an interesting model for thinking about wartime reconstruction.   What does Lincoln gain from it, on the other hand?  I think a lot of the examples are in the negative.  General Fremont puts forward a proclamation in his efforts to deal with the Confederates in the western Missouri, where he is going to start emancipating slaves in 1861.  Lincoln immediately shuts that down; Fremont is eventually removed.  There are other examples where St. Louis gets ahead of what Lincoln thinks is prudent for the whole country and so he wants to be a little more cautious of it.  On the other hand, Fremont works with William Greenleaf Eliot to create the Western Sanitary Commission and its as active as the U.S. Sanitary Commission out of Philadelphia in being the relief organization for the sick and wounded and refugees.  And so that’s an important part of the picture and the Sanitary Fair that they hold in 1864 gathers signatures and mementoes from heroes and notables all through, not only the West, but the country as a whole.  Nelly Grant, General Grant’s daughter is instrumental in selling a number of raffle tickets for important items too.  So that’s an interesting moment that thinks about how the home front notables, in ways, were connected to the military leaders as well.  </p>
<p><i><b>CWBR</i>:</b> What were some of the challenges that St. Louisans faced that made their Reconstruction experience unique to the rest of the country?</p>

<p><b>AA:</b> They had been a Union city in a border state, sort of nervously held for the Union so they’re dealing with the aftermath of a slave society as much as the South is, but the city is not destroyed.  They hadn’t been a place of battles in a way that Richmond and other places were so you have some of the political issues that faced the former Confederacy but the economic possibility that the North and South are experiencing during Reconstruction.  You have the mix of things going on and so I highlight both the success of people linked to St. Louis in creating Lincoln University, which is the school for African Americans founded by ex-U.S. Colored Troops, really a unique case in that way and also the first permanent memorial to Abraham Lincoln anywhere in the country.  On the other hand, this capital removal effort, though it looks like something that is trying to bring everyone together and bring the national attention to St. Louis, as it falls apart, very quickly it becomes clear that these are individuals who are willing to leave African-American civil rights question behind as they think about ways to reintegrate ex-Confederates and they sort of reinvigorate the Democratic Party through people like Frank Blair and Benjamin Gratz Brown, Missourians become very active in what ends up stalling, and eventually reversing, the advances of Reconstruction.</p>
<p><i><b>CWBR</i>:</b> You close your book with the quote, describing St. Louis as “impossible or visionary, unfortunate or impractical,” and suggest that this might be a broad model for the general cultural civil war at the center of U.S. history.  What can we take from your analysis of St. Louis that we can apply to our broader understanding of American history?</p>

<p><b>AA:</b> Well, the period, I would say following, even the War of 1812 forward to the firing on Fort Sumter, that period is a period of really vast dreams for the United States.  You have people like Ralph Waldo Emerson and Walt Whitman making poetic or artistic goals but you also have people like Thomas Hart Benton or the filibusterer, William Walker, making territorial goals, thinking about this is what we’re going to do when we integrate the West, this is what we are going to do when we integrate Nicaragua, Cuba, or other places that the United States doesn’t take in this period.  So, there are so many wild dreams and, the fact that many of them succeed, we often don’t think of how impossible some of these goals were.  When the question over slavery becomes paramount and the war begins, you begin to see a recalculation of how people think about the role of these broad ideas in their own lives.  In a book like Louis Menand’s <i>The Metaphysical Club</i> you see the effect of the fighting on some of the deepest thinkers in the country.  What I’m trying to do is bring the political story and the cultural story together in that way.  You see the success of some wild dreams in St. Louis-their work on the railroad, the success of Washington University-but you also see their failure of something like the moving of the national capital and the way in which they set up a large urban park that doesn’t really allow them to recapture the national imagination quite as they hoped.  And I think that those contradictions between really broad claims and the realities of the society that is dealing with the end of slavery is really something that shapes much of nineteenth-century U.S. history in places far beyond St. Louis.</p>

<b><i>Civil War Book Review (CWBR):</i></b> Today, <i>Civil War Book Review</i> is pleased to talk with Anne Marshall, author of a brand-new work, <i>Creating a Confederate Kentucky: The Lost Cause and Civil War Memory in a Border State</i>.  Professor Marshall, thank you for joining me this afternoon.</p>
<p>
<b>Anne Marshall (AM):</b> Well thank you so much for having me.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b>  What inspired you to look at the Civil War and Civil War memory and how did you come to choose Kentucky as the focus for your study?</p>
<p>
<b>AM:</b> Well I really chose Kentucky because it sort of chose me I guess.  I grew up in Kentucky; I had always sort of noticed as I was growing up that there was some real sort of dissonance between the sort of standard history of the state and its Civil War experience that I learned in fourth grade Kentucky history.  And then the sort of public commemoration that I saw all around me, whether in historical markers or monuments or sort of the public dialog about the war and so when I got to graduate school this is right around the time when there was just a lot of great work about historical memory and the Civil War coming out and this was right when David Blight’s book came out and I just thought, you know, this would be a really great angle at which to study the question of why Kentucky supposedly succeeded after the Civil War and that's really how I came to the topic.</p> 
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b>  James McPherson has written on the motivations of soldiers and, more recently, in light of important books by Chandra Manning and Gary Gallagher, what can your analysis of wartime Kentucky say about why soldiers fought?  Did the Emancipation Proclamation shift the ways in which Confederate and Unionist soldiers and residents in Kentucky viewed the conflict?</p>
<p>
<b>AM:</b>  Yes, it definitely did and I think in a way different from that which these scholars sort of point to, I think that the general consensus (at least the question that they sort of hold up) is whether or not, and to what extent, the Emancipation Proclamation served as a real motivation for northern troops who had been fighting to preserve the union.  And for Kentuckians who were (white Kentuckians at least) who were fighting to preserve the union the Emancipation Proclamation really had a negative effect.  This was certainly not what some Union troops that were from Kentucky were fighting for and, in fact, many of them became incredibly disenchanted with the war effort; they had sort of seen the writing on the wall, of course, as Lincoln had been offering compensated emancipation to Kentucky before he issued the Emancipation Proclamation.  So they sort of understood what was happening and then, of course, Kentucky was exempt from that proclamation but they were very dismayed because for them turning the war for union into a war to end slavery was antithetical to the entire reason they had decided to fight for the union to begin with, and I do think that another important difference between Kentucky (white Kentucky) and its rational for fighting, in terms of nationalism, I think it’s important to consider how many Kentuckians didn’t fight.  About 71% of white Kentuckians decided not to fight.  Many, many Kentuckians evaded Lincoln’s draft so really it’s not so much in many ways a question of I think Kentucky’s experience shows that for many loyal citizens that loyalty didn’t necessarily translate into a commitment to actually don a uniform and go off and fight.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> That's interesting and I wonder shifting towards the years after the civil war. I wonder if the violence and lawlessness during 1865-1885 if that makes Kentucky unique or were these problems and challenge did they present a problem for residents in federally-reconstructed states as well?  What might Kentucky’s experience say about the effectiveness of Federal forces in southern states?</p>
<p>
<b>AM:</b>  I think that’s a great question because I think that as we know the South was a very violent place after the Civil War, but I think with states like Kentucky, and also Missouri to even greater extent, tell us is that the border states were particularly violent and I think that this was an effect of the kind of fighting that had been so prevalent: the kind of guerrilla conflict, if you will, that had been so prevalent in the state during the Civil War.  And also the fact that they weren’t federally constructed, as you say. They really didn’t have any, there wasn’t this official military occupation in most places.  There was really no apparatus outside of the state government to quell the violence in these states and so I think that it does point to the fact that in other southern states certainly federal forces had an effect in terms of quelling violence.</p> 
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> well you mentioned earlier the unionists that were able to keep their state out of the confederacy and who fought for the union army in times.  I wonder why did former Unionists, who successfully kept the state out of the Confederacy during the war, why did they fail to garner enough support to combat the conservative violent factions that you spoke about just a second ago in the post-bellum period?</p>
<p>
<b>AM:</b> Yeah well that’s another great question and what happened was a lot of these former Unionists were the conservatives.  They weren’t necessarily these leaders, former Unionist leaders who were able to use their pulls to keep Kentucky out of the Confederacy in the Union, weren’t necessarily the ones condoning the violence.  And in many cases they deplored the violence; they were also conservative and I think that after the war, and certainly the fact that the war had turned from a war of union into a war of emancipation, affected their conservative terms after the war and there’s no question that, in spite of the fact that many of them did deplore the means (the violent means) that the violence was an effective way of bringing about political ends that really suited them.  And on the ground the violence really sort of served their interest of their constituency, at least as far as their constituencies saw this, and that this violence against African Americans was used by lower-class whites to maintain their ideas about white supremacy.  And also their access to labor, they were using violence to keep African Americans away from the polls but also away from jobs, so really these conservatives, it’s not that they condoned the violence, but they certainly were aware of the fact that, in some ways, the violence served their interests and I think that that made them sort of politically ineffectual to some extent when it came to quelling the violence.  Although, there were certainly calls from, not only former Unionists, but former Confederates, especially people like Henry Watterson who was the editor of the Louisville <i>Courier</i>, journalists at that time to crack down on the violence.</p> 
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> Shifting to one of the key phrases in the title of the book the lost cause.  Some scholars have looked at this stating that perhaps the strength of the Lost Cause in New Orleans resulted from their relatively early and easy falling to Federal forces and inherit guilt in the city that helped them to embrace Confederate celebrations after the war.  How does the experience in Kentucky compare to a place like New Orleans or perhaps other areas that failed to become Confederate strongholds during the war like Unionist Tennessee?</p>
<p>
<b>AM:</b>  Yes, well I think that it’s, rather than focusing on the experiences of those places during the war, it’s interesting to sort of see an effect that historians cite the guilt factor in New Orleans is a little bit like the fact that they tend to focus on the political crack-down under martial law and the federal forces in Kentucky late in the war as sort of a factor of turning Kentuckians against the Union once and for all in the end.  And this, according to a lot of scholars of Kentucky, was the spring board for the Lost Cause, but I think what’s interesting in all of these case whether we look at postwar Kentucky, postwar New Orleans, postwar East Tennessee, is the fact that no matter what the particular situation during the war, that southerners of all political stripes could really find a lot in the Lost Cause that suited their modern (their contemporary) political imperative during the postwar era.  I really think that there really probably is some truth to the idea of guilt or the idea of (in Kentucky) of the poor treatment at the hands of the federal officials during the war.  But what really makes the Lost Cause resonate for so long in these places is that it really carries with it a set of values in the postwar era that suits people all over the South and in the North in some places as well.  So I think that that’s really where I would place the power of the Lost Cause and reason that southerners, no matter what their wartime experience was or their sentiments were, can really sort of grab on to it in the postwar era.</p> 
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> earlier you mentioned the importance of David Blight in sort of setting the foundation in the way you looked at the post bellum period when you began your studies.  Thinking about the recent scholarship of David Blight and Heather Cox Richardson and the ways in which they examine how whites reconciled nationally by pushing blacks to the margins, might Kentucky be indicative of a broader trend and how does your study illustrate reconciliation in a national context?</p>
<p>
<b>AM:</b>  Yes, I think that one of the points that I, from the beginning of this project, saw as a both being and engaging with those notions that David Blight and Heather Cox Richardson put out there that are very important in telling the story in terms of narrative and reconciliation and having to push.  In the case of David Blight, he argues that essentially northern whites relegated this, sort of emancipation narrative as he calls it, to the dust bin in order to reconcile with southern whites.  And I think that this is a really resonant argument but one thing that I found in Kentucky is that, if you look at it and you look at what the Civil War soldiers were saying the during the war and you look at what the Civil War meant for all of these pro-slavery Unionists, what becomes apparent is that this emancipationist narrative was really never viable to begin with.  So in essence, I guess, that means that what Kentucky can show us is that some Unionists never pushed African Americans to the margin after the war because they had always pushed them to the margin; they were never part of that vision of what the Civil War meant except for the fact that that meant the end of slavery and that was a bad thing.  So I think that that really crippled white unionist memory in Kentucky for a long time and so I do think that that this really does illustrate, in terms of reconciliation, because I think that it shows that there are lots of narratives out there and that in many ways white Kentuckians show this reconciliation happening much more quickly than it does nationally, which we tend to focus on national reconciliation happening in the 1890s, but I think in Kentucky's case whites reconciled in Kentucky much, much earlier over these questions of race.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</b></i> That’s really interesting and in terms of reconciliation it’s my understanding from reading your book that GAR reunions play a large role in the reconciliation and I wonder, do you have any sense if African Americans had been incorporated into northern Grand Army of the Republic reunions and encampments before the Louisville meeting in 1895 or were the challenges that organizers faced to incorporate African-American veterans more commonplace?</p>
<p>
<b>AM:</b> Yes, actually African Americans had been regular part of GAR meetings in may northern chapters.  They were integrated so African Americans and whites joined alike, they met alike, they remembered the war in some common ways and actually there’s a great book out about this, Barbara Gannon’s, <i>The Won Cause</i> where she actually refutes some of what David Blight argues as well in terms of war memories and she uses the GAR membership and the integrated GAR membership to really show this.  And so I think, in that sense, Louisville was presented a sort of new challenge: how were these northern, integrated chapters going to come in as equals; they come to the South and suddenly African Americans and white members were supposed to be segregated and have different accommodations and sit in separate places and really, in that sense, the Louisville experience was different.</p> 
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b>  What did the southern literature during the period, specifically Annie Fellows Johnston who sold millions of copies of The Little Colonel (later becoming a movie), what did that do for the image of the South in a national context, as we are looking at southern literature and sort of the popularity of things like gone with the wind and what not in popular culture in giving an impression of southern culture?</p>
<p>
<b>AM:</b>  Yes, well I would say that the <i>Little Colonel</i> series had a similar effect to the works of Joel Chandler Harris or Thomas Nelson Page in that it really sort of spun these tales even though the Little Colonel was set in the New South, it was actually set at the turn of the century, which is when Annie Fellows Johnston was writing.  It really evoked a sort of Old South gentility; it gave northerners a way to sort of look at the South and the post-Civil War South which carried according to Annie Fellows Johnston a lot of the same conventions in terms of that the Old South had carried, for example, the African-American characters were not slaves but they were devoted servants, still, who had chosen to remain with their former owners because they were well-treated and happy.  And there was a lot this air of the Old South, that was sort of positioned in the New South and that gave northerners (people all over the world as a matter of fact) a way to look at the South with this sort of sense of nostalgia, a sense that sort of gave it a comforting elegant gentile setting and a world that was increasingly tumultuous.  This was a time of increasing industrialization and increasing immigration and a lot of white Americans all over the nation were really sort of unsure about what was happening to their increasingly urbanized world.  And so being able to go and read these books that evoked this sense of Old South/New South gentility was sort of a form of escapism that was really very appealing to many Americans.</p> 
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b>  I wonder, how does looking at the ways in which Kentucky emerged from the war inform or shape our understanding of current events in a state like Kentucky versus other states like South Carolina, Alabama, or Pennsylvania?</p>
<p>
<b>AM:</b>  Yes, well I’m not sure that we can sort of trace a direct lineage in terms of a sort of causes and effects of Kentucky’s war experiences and its sort of contemporary realities of Kentucky.  But I certainly think if we're thinking about identity which is something I wrote a lot about in this book, not only just looking at the Civil War narrative that that came out of Kentucky's Civil War experience in the aftermath, but I was also looking at, in a general the way, that these Civil War narratives sort of created an identity for the state as a whole.  And I certainly think that the way that Kentucky's identity developed after the war, the things that made it seem like a former Confederate state have stuck with it in a lot of different ways, it still has this reputation for being sort of simultaneously poor but also having a sort of patina of wealth to it which we can associate with the Old South.  Some of what Annie Fellows Johnston was trying to create in her books, for example, and it still has a reputation for being a sort of violent state, so I think that there are still some elements there that are.  Certainly the racism that existed in postwar Kentucky that informed a lot of this identity is still there; I’m not sure that it’s any greater of an extent in Kentucky than it is in certainly in other southern places, and perhaps even in northern places today, but there’s still elements of that there so I think, in those ways, some of this identity is still sticking with Kentucky.</p> 
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> Well it’s interesting you mention identity and I have to ask why has it taken so long to incorporate African Americans and even Abraham Lincoln into the historical analysis of the Civil War in Kentucky and turning to the future and the present as well how has the Civil War Sesquicentennial celebration encouraged engaging and incorporating groups like these groups?</p>
<p>
<b>AM:</b> Well I think in terms of African Americans I think Kentucky is sort of where a lot of other southern and formerly Confederate states are on this sort of public acknowledgement of African-American history in general.  But also the history of slavery, the history of slavery’s influence on Kentucky's Civil War experience, and also the impact that African Americans have had on Kentucky's Civil War experience in that its sort of come in the aftermath of the Civil Rights Movement where people were connecting present fights for African-American rights in the 1960s and on into the 1970s with the deprivation of those rights that had come out of the aftermath of slavery.  And then had the promise of those rights had not been fulfilled in the Reconstruction era, I think that in this sense it’s sort of similar to the national narrative and it’s just really been in the last 20 or 25 years or so that really African-American groups have really been at the forefront of trying to gain recognition for their role in the state’s history and to insert their experiences into the Civil War narrative of the state’s history.  And the Lincoln question is really interesting because he was of course a Kentuckian and was hated in his home state for so long, getting less than 2% of the popular vote in 1860, and then he really didn’t gain any popularity among the states whites after the war, so what’s really been interesting of course that the Lincoln bicentennial, which those events were carried out mostly in 2009, and the state sort of did a whole 180 on this one and embraced Abraham Lincoln and had a couple of years of celebrations really where they focused on every aspect no matter how small every connection that Lincoln had in the state.  And I think that that’s really also a realization of Lincoln’s legacy and buying into this finally saying Kentucky is buying into this David Blight emancipationist narrative 150 years later to I think that the sesquicentennial was sort of, in essence, took off the tone for the sesquicentennial remembrance have come out of the Lincoln bicentennial in the sense that, with the sort of events the state is highlighting this year ,they are trying to sell a broader story of the Civil War that incorporates Confederates, white Unionists, African Americans so I think that this sort of evolution of historical memory and public history as well.</p>

<p><b><i>Civil War Book Review (CWBR)</i></b>: Today the Civil War Book Review is excited to speak with Anne Sarah Rubin, associate professor of history at the University of Maryland Baltimore County. Professor Rubin previously authored, <i>A Shattered Nation: The Rise and Fall of the Confederacy, 1861-1868</i>. Today we get to discuss her most recent book, <i>Through the Heart of Dixie: Sherman's March and American Memory</i>. Professor Rubin, thank you for joining us today.</p>

<b>Anne Sarah Rubin (ASR)</b>: Thank you very much for having me. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: So just to start we always like to hear, what lead you to this project? </p> 

<p><b>ASR</b>: I decided to write about Sherman's march and the place of Sherman's march in American culture a long time actually before I started the book.  It was a kind of confluences of things that happened during graduate school, things that I read and things that I saw. I had read Charles Royster's <i>The Destructive War</i>, which is a fascinating dual biography of Sherman and Stonewall Jackson and it looks in the way of how Americans became more comfortable with this kind of destruction and devastation. All around that same time was the first time I saw the Ross McElwee movie <i>Sherman's March</i> where he, in the early 1980's goes down South and he was planning to write a documentary about the legacy of Sherman's March. He wound up having all these romantic problems, so what the movie really becomes is him trying to figure out why he can't have a girlfriend and Sherman's March is a metaphor. I thought that was really interesting and unusual. Also, right around that time I saw references in a documentary then read James Reston's book <i>Sherman’s March in Vietnam</i>, where Reston tries to make a connection between Sherman's march and the destructiveness and devastation that Americans wreaked in Vietnam. Somehow it all kind of came together. There was something special about Sherman's march that made it unlike other Civil War campaigns and that gave it a sort of greater cultural power than other campaigns and events had, so that's why I decided to start exploring it. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: It's interesting that what draws you in is the cultural power of the march and we see that even in the name, because it's “Sherman's March to the Sea” but we really don't have a good name for it. It seems like we ought to at least add “Sherman's March to the Sea, and Back,” right? </p> 

<p><b>ASR</b>: Right, exactly and what happens, what I think is really interesting and what I was not very aware of in the beginning was how important the Carolinas campaign actually is. First of all, Sherman thought that Carolinas campaign was more important and I think at one point he refers to the march to the sea to a mere change of base. It's the Carolinas campaign that is in fact even more devastating and destruction than the Georgia portion of the march. There's a real since of anger and vengeance in South Carolina in the part of the men and Sherman is very disingenuous about this in his memoir he writes, “Well somehow the men got the idea that South Carolina was the cause of all their troubles and the cause of this war. They wanted to be harder on South Carolina and I felt like I couldn’t restrain them less they sort of loose their fighting edge and their vigor.”  He lets them loose on South Carolina and there is much more destruction of personal property of houses as opposed to outbuildings. I'm not minimizing what happens in Georgia only saying that it's actually worse than South Carolina and yet it's much less well known. Then in North Carolina the men are supposed to put the gloves back on, because of Unionism in North Carolina because of the unionist population there. They don't quite do it to the degree I think that Sherman would have wanted them to do. That's why the book in its entirety is about Sherman's march and I felt really strongly about how it had to be more than just the Georgia piece. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: Why is it you think that Georgia--and it seems like it happened fairly quickly by the early twentieth century—Georgia and Atlanta specifically kind of manages to claim the effects of that march almost all to itself and it seems like especially the South Carolina story is sort of lost outside of South Carolina. Why do you think that happened so quickly? </p>

<p><b>ASR</b>: It is really a curious thing and I think it happened for a couple of reasons. I think there is sort of narrative tidiness to the Georgia piece of it that it's the march to the sea. It's got this kind of inherent drama or destination, you're going to the sea. I think that's why, for example, it holds more cultural power, meaning, and people remember its violence more than the Shenandoah Valley Campaign or something like that in terms of how it blocks everything out. Also, a lot of it actually is the impact of <i>Gone with the Wind</i>, so that's a little later than what you're saying. It's the 1930's, 1936 is the novel and the movie is 1939. <i>Gone with the Wind</i> just exerts so much influence and defined Sherman's march for generations of Americans. One of the things that's pretty important to understand about <i>Gone with the Wind</i> is that Margaret Mitchell had grown up hearing stories about Sherman's march. It had happened to her grandparents and she also did a lot of research. She's very very careful in the book to be as scrupulously accurate as she can about all the military maneuvers. She writes in a letter at one point saying, ""I don't want anybody coming to me and saying that I got it wrong."" True confession time, I had seen <i>Gone With the Wind</i> for the first time in the 8th grade history class, and I always like to add unironically.  I actually grew up in the North too, this was right outside New York City. Then I had read the book, which I was about thirteen at the time and it was the longest book I had ever read, I was so enamored by the romance and all the reasons <i>Gone with the Wind</i> is a great novel and movie. Then when I became a historian and a southern historian then I started to realize how much was problematic about <i>Gone with the Wind</i>--the way it treats race and reconstruction. I moved away from it for a while but when I started looking at it again for this book, I sat down and reread the novel. For the first night I thought I'd just skim it and wound up literally staying up until two in the morning reading it. I was sort of sucked back into it again. Now I see that <i>Gone with the Wind</i> is this really powerful document. If you want an illustration of what white southerners thought about the Civil War and reconstruction in the 1920's and 30's read <i>Gone with the Wind</i>. It's straight out the Dunning School. For all of those reasons I think <i>Gone with the Wind</i> has a huge impact. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: Do you think the timing of<i> Gone with the Wind</i> is also sort of critical? It emerges right about the same time that a lot of these actual Union veterans of the march, the “bummers,” a lot of them are in their later years or gone. Do you think that the timing was right for, even in the North, a narrative that suggested the cause may have been just, but even [northerners] can admit or believe that Sherman was perhaps a little bit too much? </p>

<p><b>ASR</b>: I think that's interesting. I haven't really thought about that but you're exactly right. You know it comes out, the movie, right around the 75th anniversary of the march. There's a huge fanfare about it. They do this three day premiere with people dressed up in costumes and hoop skirts. In one of these crazy you-can't-make-it-up historical coincidences, Martin Luther King as a child actually sings in a choir that performs at the <i>Gone with the Wind premiere</i>. What are the chances? So anyway I do think there is a lot of that, that there's not ever a good kind of northern counter-narrative of Sherman’s march. Even the northern novels don't really--Yeah that's right there's not really a northern defense of the march in that period. Veterans themselves in the 1870's, 80's, and 90's they talk about the march in very heroic terms that they see it as winning the war and they minimize the degree of destruction, but you don't really see that coming out afterwards. The condemnations of <i>Gone with the Wind</i> are not about the way it portrays Sherman it's about the way it portrays African Americans and the way it portrays Reconstruction, as the carnival of corruption. So you're right that's a great insight. I should have put that in the book. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: Going off of your point there about Reconstruction it does seem that this march is really heavily mythologized very quickly and even though it has a tidy narrative as you say you also write that it sort of is missing the central cast of characters and missing the epic battles that the other mythologized events in the Civil War like Pickett's Charge, and there are a number of reasons why it occupies such a huge space. I was hoping you could expand on that a little bit. </p> 

<p><b>ASR</b>: There's very few actual battles along Sherman's march and from the Union side in particular they take very few casualties over the course of the march. Very few people died. That's one of the reasons that Union soldiers remember the march fondly. It doesn't have the kind of heroic grandeur such as Pickett's Charge or Cold Harbor or anything like that. It is the military movement that is about civilians, I think in a way that fewer or any other campaigns are described that way. Historians know about all of these campaigns against civilians and places on the border or as I mention the Shenandoah Valley, but the general public doesn't. So what happens is that Sherman's march becomes the scapegoat for all the ills visited on civilians, and all the devastation wrought on the South. Then I think there's a little bit of conflation too of any destruction and devastation is going be blamed on Sherman. These legends, Oh Sherman burned my family’s house in Alabama, well no, because he wasn't there. I've had people come up to me giving talks and someone how came up to me recently saying ""Oh we have a chair with scorch marks on the back and the scorch marks are from Sherman,"" and it could be from the march because this person mentioned where the chair had been and that in fact was in South Carolina on the route of the march so that could be true. But I think there's a lot of that kind of legend that grows up around it. </p> 

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: Well even in just the way the march is described I thought it was interesting when it comes down to the tactics.  In the [popular] narrative, it always comes down in a swath, but it wasn’t actually in a swath right? </p>

<p><b>ASR</b>: The phrase that I always use is, we think of it as this 50-mile wide lawn mower stripe but it's not. It's more like a 50-mile row of stitches in that there are a lot of places that aren't touched on Sherman's march. One of the things I explore in the book are that there are all these different stories and legends that grow up, about the reasons why this house was spared or that house was spared. It occurred to that the reason there are so many stories about homes being spared for different reasons was in fact so many homes were spared. You can't make this argument that Sherman's march cut this 50-mile wide swath and at the same time have tourism brochures and what-not praising all the antebellum homes that are still standing. It becomes this interesting way for stories about the march to come up that [people say] “this house was spared because we put up Masonic apron on the door or that house was spared because there were pretty girls there, or we saved the family silver by hiding it somewhere clever, or the jewelry got stuck in the baby’s diaper and that's why we still have the jewelry.” These ways of outwitting the Yankees become really prevalent, common stories. </p> 

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: It seems that compares to a lot of other Civil War memory--of course women have played a huge role in shaping a lot of those memories with the Daughters of the Confederacy and what-not--but it seems women play an even more essential role when it comes to Sherman's march because they're actually the actors, right? </p>

<p><b>ASR</b>: In most cases women were the ones that confronted the Sherman soldiers when they came onto their farms or plantations. Partly this was because most able-bodied men were away, and those able-bodied men who weren't away often hid when they knew Sherman was coming. They figured the women would be largely protected by their gender. One of the big misconceptions we have today about Sherman's march is that we talk about it in the context of “total war,” whatever “total war” means, and to us it means a war on civilians that involves the death of civilians. It's total war in the WWII or the Vietnam or Gulf War sense where there's actual killing of civilians, and that just doesn't happen along Sherman's march. They're not hauling civilians out and shooting them. They're not using sexual violence as a weapon the way that we've seen in ethnic cleansing and things like that. I don't want to minimize the impact the march had on civilians and it was terrifying for them, but it was a war against civilian property not against civilian persons. </p> 

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: Then why do you think that narrative seems to be so entrenched? It seems pretty evident that even if one could broadly define Sherman's war against property as still some kind of form of terror tactics, he's not the first even in the Civil War to do that. </p>

<p><b>ASR</b>: I think it's the triumph actually of a lot of the Lost Cause in ascribing this Sherman and it's the triumph of something like <i>Gone With the Wind</i> where that's the narrative that's put forward. Sherman I think, people always ask if Sherman was a war criminal and the answer to that I would say is no. I think Sherman is someone who knew very well the laws of war and I would say that he knew where the line was and he pushed right up against that line, but didn’t step over the line of what was permissible under the laws of war at the time. The only cases were where I think he might have are where in retaliation for Confederate actions he, in one case a Union soldier steps on a minefield in Georgia and has his legs blown off and Sherman calls up a bunch of prisoners of war and has them walk across the minefield. They actually survived all that. Then there are some cases in South Carolina and North Carolina where some groups of Union foragers were killed and in retaliation Sherman ordered some Confederate prisoners killed. That I think is more morally problematic than the kind of destruction and destroying of supplies that the march engaged in. </p> 

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: It’s sort of ironic that one of the most morally problematic events of the whole march is actually afflicted on freed slaves when that is sort of Sherman's other legacy is that he visited great destruction on white southerners but also an agent of emancipation. </p>

<p><b>ASR</b>: Yeah, I think that's one of the great contradictions of Sherman in Sherman's march. That's the other thing, when people talk about the destruction and devastation of Sherman's march they're really talking about how it affected southern whites when in fact it's African Americans who in many ways bear sort of the equal brunt of the destruction. If all of the food in an area is taken or ruined that's starving African Americans as well as whites. Sherman was no friend to African Americans really he did not believe, for example, in African American troops. He did not have African Americans units marching with him and one of his subordinate commanders, in this event that you allude to at Ebenezer Creek in Georgia, where it's a big cypress swamp and the Union soldiers are crossing over pontoon bridges and they're being followed by hundreds if not thousands African Americans, the subordinate commander actually named Jefferson Davis--no relation to the Confederate president--orders the pontoon bridges pulled up and leaves these African Americans with Confederate cavalry closing in on them. Their choice is try to swim across, which many try and many drown, or to be captured and sent back into slavery, which is what happens to them. Sherman is ok with what happens he doesn't condemn Davis for this, but when the news reaches Washington the Secretary of War Stanton comes down and is chastising Sherman for this and saying you [Sherman] go to do something for African Americans. So they meet first with about twenty African American ministers in Savannah and say, ""Well what do you want, what do you want to come out of the war?""  And they say, ""We want land.""  Sherman offers a suggestion so outlandish that [Stanton] will back off--this is Special Order 15—that they take all of this land that has been abandoned by whites who fled all along the coast of Georgia and South Carolina, altogether about 400,000 acres, and divide it up into plots for African American families to settle on.  From Sherman's perspective, that solves two problems.  It gets Stanton off his back, and it means that these thousands of African American who've been following him will be resettled on this land and not continue to follow.  And it happens that this plan is briefly put into effect, but I think the true test of it is that when Andrew Johnson, after the war, essentially voids it by returning all of this land to its original owners, Sherman doesn't say a word.  He's moved on, he doesn’t care.  He is simultaneously this great liberator, and his army is a great army of liberation, but they're not willing motivators.  They're not ideologically motivated. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: Sherman has quite a long career in fiction after the war and after he died, but it seems like that is kind of a theme--whether in emancipation, or in fiction, or in Lost Cause histories--of Sherman being this agent that causes things to happen, but he's not actually there.  He's always sort of there, but off-frame.  I thought that was sort of an interesting contrast, in your section on depictions in art and fiction, with somebody like Lee, who is like a King Arthur figure in a lot of depictions, always on his horse leading and a presence.  I wonder if that is indicative of how people imagine Sherman as an early practitioner of total war--do people more naturally imagine Sherman as hunched over a table of maps and troops strength readouts, sort of callously directing the logistics rather than galloping across a battlefield? </p>

<p><b>ASR</b>: I don't know if I ever thought of that--I think your portrayal of him hunched over a map is more generous than what I think are stereotypical portrayals, which is sort of Sherman, wild-eyed, holding a torch, where Sherman is personally burning things everywhere he goes.  Portrayals of Sherman are interesting.  There are not a lot of portrayals of Sherman's march, certainly--The Mort Künstler, Don Troiani, those paintings that people love--are definitely more of a glorification of the war in Virginia.  Sherman, though, does have such a long postwar career too.  He's General-in-Chief of the Army for about another 15-20 years.  One thing I was struck by was that when he died in 1891, there was this great outpouring of grief, a national outpouring of grief, with the black-bordered newspaper columns and the big funeral and all of that.  So he was a big national figure, and doesn't have nearly the number of statues that Lee has, but he does have a few big statues.  Specifically, the one in New York City at 59th Street, at the entrance to Central Park, there's also a large one in Washington D.C. So I don't know that he's that slighted.  Although I will say that I grew up seeing that statue all the time and had no idea that it was Sherman until I started working on this book. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: Of course that could just be a function of being around a landmark, monuments all the time, you may not think to really look at it until you move away from it.  But to backtrack a bit, I wanted to hear about the ""bummers.""  You were sort of surprised by their postwar sentiments, right? </p>

<p><b>ASR</b>: Yeah, because again, when you come of age in the post-Vietnam world, where so much of the writing about soldiers is in the vein of memoirs talking about post-traumatic stress, and soldiers who were asked to do terrible things, asked to make war on civilians, and they feel guilty about that and they feel traumatized by all that.  You just don't find that with Sherman's ""bummers,"" with the marchers.  The big caveat to that, of course, is that I can only know what they wrote down.  So certainly, the veterans who are gung-ho veterans, who belong to these veterans organizations and who go around and make speeches and all of that, are only one subset.  They don't speak for all veterans, but the dominant story that they tell is one of tremendous pride in their service, tremendous pride in the march.  They believed that they ended the war.  I think they're not wrong about that.  The analogy that I draw is that they're sort of like the airmen on the <i>Enola Gay</i>, who believed that what they did was necessary, was right, and brought the war to a close.  So they're not troubled by it, they're remarkably <i>un</i>troubled by it, I found.  To them this was the great moment of their lives, the great experience of many of their lives. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: This march just keeps inspiring other people to try to experience it for themselves too.  This experience thing [of Sherman's march], I don't know that it's stronger than with other events, because certainly people visit battlefields all the time, but retracing this entire march is a larger undertaking than visiting a battlefield park for a day.  It inspires this peculiar form of travel writing from just after the war through present day, people travelling through the South, coming to wildly different conclusions over time by visiting the same locales, and you end up deciding to follow in their footsteps, so what was that like? </p>

<p><b>ASR</b>:  I felt like I couldn't really write about Sherman's march, because so much of what I write has to do with these specific places, that I didn't feel like I could do it without visiting them myself.  I didn't retrace the entire march but I did about two-thirds to three-quarters of it.  I did all of Georgia in 2008, then I did the North Carolina from the Bennett place—from the surrender--to Columbia and then further south of Columbia.  I actually did that in reverse, because I was driving down from Maryland.  I found it really interesting.  I thought that I would see a lot more memorialization.  And I just didn't find as much as I thought I would.  Even the roadside markers seemed more about troop movements, and not really the impact of the march.  I found that surprising.  There was also such a contrast in the way that Atlanta sort takes their Sherman experience of being burned right before Sherman leaves on the march, and they kind of run with it.  Atlanta put the Phoenix on their city seal, and in a lot of way the march is kind of the best thing that ever happened to Atlanta, whereas I was really struck in Columbia by how much angrier Columbia seemed.  Columbia seemed to still retain this sense of grievance from Sherman.  I’m actually looking forward to a big symposium there on the anniversary of Sherman’s burning the city.  I was glad I got to go, and it will be interesting to go back.  One of the fun side-effects of this book coming out is that I got to back to a few places.  Even just seeing the names on the road signs again. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: Given how much more room you saw in the memorializations you mentioned, for added complexity that you show in the book here, moving the memory beyond just troop movements, do think that the memory of the march is as fluid as it was in the past?  Do you think we'll start to see a little of this complexity and contradiction work its way into the popular memory? </p>

<p><b>ASR</b>: That's hard to say, I'd like to think that complexity and fluidity moves in.  Certainly the Civil War Sesquicentennial in general has been a much more rich and diverse and complicated view of the war and what happened during the war, compared to the centennial.  I'm by nature an optimist, so I'll say yes, I think our understating will become more complicated and more subtle, rather than fixed.  So we’ll close on an up note. </p>

<p><b><i>Civil War Book Review (CWBR)</i></b>: Today the Civil War Book Review is happy to speak with Brian Craig Miller, Associate Professor of History at Emporia State University.  Professor Miller previously authored <i>John Bell Hood and the Fight for Civil War Memory</i>, and is Editor of the journal <i>Civil War History</i>.  Today we get to discuss his most recent book, <i>Empty Sleeves: Amputation in the Civil War South</i>.  Professor Miller, thank you for joining us today.</p>

<p><b>Brian Craig Miller (BCM) </b>: Thank you very much for having me. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: Ok so I always ask to start about what drew you to this project, but I think in this case it’s a particularly important question, given how potentially relevant these veterans’ challenges, and their society’s reactions were, as you mentioned toward the end of your book. </p>

<p><b>BCM</b>: Yeah, it sort of came by accident in some ways.  In graduate school we were discussing new ways of thinking about Reconstruction, and at that time I was starting to think about John Bell Hood as a potential thesis and dissertation topic, and since he was a double amputee, I thought wouldn’t that be a really interesting way at getting at his particular life?  In the midst of writing about Hood and his amputation and what that meant, ultimately, to his manhood and how it affected him in the postwar period, I started getting these letters in the mail that I mention in the epilogue, from these various veterans organizations, that showed amputees from Iraq and Afghanistan who had acquired prosthetic limbs and were looking for a financial donation to help them buy some sort of craft kit.  It was usually around the holidays so they could assemble a model kit and then paint it to give them something to do with their functioning limb, which I thought was really fascinating, in terms of the way that these photographs were taken, of these particular veterans, that were sent with the mailing to acquire funds.  To me, it became one of those things were the past of the Civil War and the present day crisis, that I think a lot of men and women who are returning from war are facing now, particularly with some issues with gaining the health care that they need quickly, and just simply being recognized.  That they have extensive challenges both with issues of mobility as well as chronic pain they may be facing, as well as just simple recognition for their military service.  So I think in many ways, the present day conflict, and the reverberations and aftermath of that conflict, bled into this particular project to think about, what does it actually mean in the Civil War era, to return home missing an arm or a leg, and how does Southern society, that has just been defeated in war, incorporate the damaged individual into the fold of society?  I think that sort of matches where the Civil War historiography is going right now.  I think the current trends of the issues veterans are facing in Iraq and Afghanistan are starting to appear in the Civil War era, with the work done recently by Brian Matthew Jordan, or James Martin, or I think you will see work here shortly from Diane Miller Sommerville, and Barbara Gannon, who are all talking about the challenges that veterans are facing, and I think that will continue on in the near future. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: A very interesting thing about this project is how it’s challenging in two different directions, because there is, as you mentioned, there’s real parallels with the challenges veterans face today and certainly, challenges that veterans from both sides of the Civil War faced, but then there are a lot of particularities to what Southern veterans experienced.  I was wondering if you could explain why, specifically, you choose to look at Southern veterans? </p>

<p><b>BCM</b>: The reason for the Southern veteran, if you will, being the center of this project is because in some ways I thought it would be more challenging to do the Southern side of the story, which certainly is not something that we traditionally see in Civil War scholarship.  A lot of times when volumes are produced on veterans, in particular, I would say that a vast majority of the source material and the stories within those books are mostly focused on Northern veterans, and for good reason.  The paper trail is much greater, the United States medical records are more extensive and easily accessible, so I wanted to focus on the South and especially in its connection to manhood.  We think of how Southerners defined their manhood before the American Civil War, with honor, or this internalization that men actually had to go through to realize they were a man, and how they outwardly showed that through how they physically appeared, how they interacted with the public, how they controlled their drinking or their horses and so forth.  And also their ability to master or control their wives, their slaves, their children, and their own personal behaviors.  The Civil War in many ways alters a lot of those particular facets of defining manhood.  For example, honor is shattered in many ways because Southern men are going off to war to fight to prove their manhood and they’re returning as military failures.  Their concept of mastery has been completely overturned because of emancipation and women taking a much more prominent role in literally running many Southern households while their men were away fighting the war itself.  So it seems that in some ways when men are returning home, and society was once again looking to them as men, it seems that the male physique, which had been so important in the prewar era, would in some ways naturally rise back to the top again.  However, because now the male physique has been battered in many ways, not just through amputation but because of physical scarring or emotional scarring that has made these men more dependent on their wives, on their children, on their society in general to care for them, which certainly would have been a mark of feminization in the prewar period.  What I was struck with, was I found some isolated cases of amputees in the South before the American Civil War, in the 1840s and ‘50s, many of them amputees from the Mexican-American War or from the Texas independence conflict, and what I found is that Southern society didn’t necessarily embrace them.  Even though they would be considered military heroes, they were still viewed in a negative light because their physical being, if you will—their body—had been battered, broken or damaged in some way, which was seen as a marker of feminization, or certainly not pristine manhood.  That sense seems to carry its way through the Civil War and into the postwar period, creating what historian LeaAnn Whites calls, and others have echoed, a “crisis in manhood.”  I think it’s a crisis that was deeper and more profound than historians have been willing to acknowledge, particularly because of this newfound dependent place in which Southern men find themselves, returning home, needing assistance to survive, coming back to a society that isn’t necessarily thrilled that their military prospects turned out so poorly. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: It’s that return of damaged physiques that seems to offer the starkest contrast between Southern and Northern veterans.  The Union guys can expect limb replacement programs from the government, they have Federal pensions, and of course they won, so there’s this outpouring of public gratitude for having won.  For Confederate veterans there are already steeper obstacles because of the shattered economy in the South, but then there are all these notions of Southern male honor, the pall of defeat, and these hinder the support that these guys can expect.  Since we’re already on that topic, could you talk about the ways in which those notions of honor hindered the support that they could expect? </p>

<p><b>BCM</b>: Yeah, it seems in particular that because these men would not get any Federal benefits at all, that they would have to be reliant on benevolent societies, local communities, or state governments to step up and take action.  The benevolent societies were completely overwhelmed.  I think they had great intentions early on, particularly the local groups that were gathering supplies or raising funds to buy prosthetic limbs, but they simply could not handle hundreds of men who needed their assistance, particularly when they were working based on donations.  The eye then focused on state governments, where you only see seven Southern states start prosthetic limb programs—North Carolina, Mississippi, etc., some of these deeper South states—start a limb program, starting with legs, then eventually arms.  But the programs are mixed.  They take some time, and require that the amputee themselves travel to usually the state capital or another other major city in that state to acquire the limb.  It would require some measurements and you’d have to wait for the limb to be constructed and then fitted.  Some men found them very useful, others did not, they found them painful.  States started to revise some of those programs by offering men a choice between a limb or a cash payment.  I discovered that as those programs advanced a few years, that men wanted the cash payment.  It was more important for them to have seventy-five or one hundred dollars up front rather than a prosthetic limb that <i>may</i> increase mobility or <i>may</i> hide the fact that they received a catastrophic injury during the war, but it seems that their dire straits of poverty required them to take the cash payment. </p> 

<p>Those programs fizzled out and you started to see other programs like land grant programs.  Louisiana and Texas particularly gave large tracts of land to amputees.  In west Texas and more rural areas of Louisiana, but those programs weren’t as successful as the state governments hoped them to be, because many of these amputated men didn’t know what to do with such large parcels of land unless they had family members who could help them farm these plots of land.  So ultimately it comes down to the pension programs.  Because of Unionist governments, because of Constitutional questions within state governments themselves, you have legislators, particularly in Texas, wondering if they <i>should</i> actually, if Confederate veterans should be seen as wards of the state, if this dependency that they’re going to have on a government handout payment in the form of four times a year—is that appropriate, is that an honorable endeavor to take place?  The governor of Florida actually questioned if this is a manly enterprise.  If Southern veterans were true men [the governor reasoned], then they shouldn’t have to rely on state governments in order to survive.  So the pension programs are very slow coming.  By the 1880s, some of the states started to buy into these programs, and they started to pop up from time to time all the way through Kentucky, which was one of the last to start its program, in the nineteen-teens, which was almost fifty years after the conflict itself.  Many of these veterans have started fade away, and haven’t even survived to the point where they could actually collect a pension.  That I think was most striking to me.  The Lost Cause, in many ways, has allowed us to think that these veterans returned home, were completely embraced by Southern communities, the women took care of them, they lifted them up, they constructed monuments in their honor, they praised them, and cared for them.  But the reality is that these men came home, they had no financial prospects, they ended up begging on the streets in some cases, or trying to find odd work here and there, but the doors were closed to them.  In fact, one veteran famously noted the sign that appears when he looks for work everywhere, “no maimed veteran need apply.” These men were not being recognized by society as men, let alone men who could be productive in a postwar Southern economy. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: Talking about how overwhelmed these benevolent societies were, about how this question eventually had to go to the states and to politicians because there’s just no other institution that’s capable of supporting them.  In a general sense, I’m curious about numbers, and if there are numbers available, for Southern veterans.  Looking at some of the tables in the book, the number of amputees seems a little lower than one might expect, especially once you divide them up among the states.  But at the same time, this controversial subset of veterans becomes a symbol for veterans, especially aged veterans, writ large.  So I was wondering first about the numbers, and second how they became such a powerful symbol. </p>

<p><b>BCM</b>: The numbers are a tricky prospect for anyone working on Southern medical history.  A lot of the records for medical hospitals and medical care were not standardized until several months into the war itself, so you didn’t have appropriate record keeping.  A lot of it was just doctors writing things down in ledger books, which of course were scattered all over the South.  Then as the Confederate government starts to centralize these medical records, and a lot of them were destroyed when the Confederate capital of Richmond was evacuated in 1865.  So we don’t have an exact count of how many Confederate amputees there were.  I think most medical historians have estimated it’s probably close to the Union figure, which was around 29,000, but it’s really difficult to pinpoint that exact number.  The pension files themselves may be useful in counting that number, but in some states they’re still medically sealed, because they contain medical information so historians are not actually able to go and look at that information.  This is actually applicable in the state of Texas, for instance.  The medical portion of pension files in Texas is not available for historians because it contains sensitive medical details, so again, so that would maybe be one way of counting these amputees, but we’re certainly not able to do so in a physical sense.  I can tell you that what medical there is does show that the number of amputees did decline during the course of the Civil War, which I think may surprise many readers with general Civil War knowledge, which sees this as a continued medical crisis throughout the war, but it seems that by 1864, Southern surgeons and hospitals have become very regulated, with very strict cleanliness policies, and doctors themselves had access by that time not just to practice but to medical journals and surgical manuals which had been updated.  These went step-by-step on when and when not you should amputate, and it became so standardized in practice that surgeons, particularly by the last year of the war, were able to treat thousands of gunshot wounds, but weren’t necessarily amputating at the same rate that they had done at Manassas or Shiloh, in the early part of the war, where you saw surgeons completely overwhelmed, without extensive experience , and they were cutting off limbs left and right.</p>  

<p>I think in some ways we can see the amputee, particularly because he became such a prominent physical being in many Southern communities, to be elevated to a different stature amongst other Southern veterans.  But it struck me again, particularly with these benevolent groups, that the amputees themselves aren’t always easily recognized in Southern society. You could have instances in some Southern communities where veterans and amputees begging on the streets were told that they were no longer allowed to do this.  They would be rounded up—particularly in the city New Orleans—and they would be rounded up and dumped into the Shakespeare Alms House.  So the city actually went back and revised that statute to say that actual Confederate veterans could remain begging on the streets, but what happens is some men are able to acquire Confederate uniforms by buying them or stealing them, and get through that loophole and beg for money as an amputee that would not have been caused by a war-related injury.</p>  

<p>I thought that the United Confederate Veterans, which becomes the largest Confederate veteran organization by the 1890s, would be a great place for amputees in order to be positioned and heralded, but what I found was that not a lot of amputated men were joining this organization, let alone being recognized by the organization.  The UCV does have in their mantra that benevolence is part of who they are, and they want donations to be solicited so they can help take care of aging veterans and infirm veterans, particularly in veterans’ homes across the South, but once state governments started to get involved and take over those veterans’ homes, it seems a lot of the financial resources the UCV would have put into taking care of veterans now goes to other endeavors, particularly textbook writing.  The UCV becomes very, very concentrated on making sure that the narrative of the war is written from a Southern point of view, and that Southern point-of-view textbooks are being used in classrooms across the South, rather than in lifting up and caring for these amputated men.  Maybe it’s because amputated veterans aren’t interested in joining a veterans’ organization, or they simply don’t have the financial resources to pay dues or to travel due to mobility issues, to go to camp meetings, or even to the national reunions that the UCV is holding from place-to-place.  Or they simply don’t want to return to locations where that injury actually took place.  A lot of times UCV reunions are taking place at or near battlefields where veterans can go and see where the action took place and maybe that’s something they’re simply not interested in reliving. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: Yeah I thought it was telling in the section you had on allocations of funds from Mississippi and, at the same time that some $2,600-2,700 was allocated for amputees, there was some $20,000 allocated for the defense of Jefferson Davis.  There seems to have been quite a mismatch between the rhetoric of supporting veterans, compared to when it actually came time to pay for such things. </p>

<p><b>BCM</b>: The thing that’s fascinating about that Mississippi number with historians is that it grows.  I’ve actually seen some popular Civil War books, looking at the darker crisis of the Civil War, which are now taking that number and saying that Mississippi spent fifty percent of its state budget.  It was twenty percent, then it was forty percent, now it’s fifty percent.  That’s simply just not true.  Mississippi actually spent about what everybody else did, which was a small portion of their budget, partially because there were such large hurdles for these men to actually go through and apply—because they had to be counted, they had to be verified.  In order to get you prosthetic limb, you had to prove that you were an honorable man, that you didn’t desert from the war, that you honorably left the war, that you surrendered or were discharged in an appropriate way, and you had to get medical guys to step forward, your physicians, surgeons had to say that this guy’s amputation took place during the Civil War.  So it became a very large burden of proof on these men just to actually fill out the paperwork and then swear and affidavit before a judge to actually get the prosthetic limb to begin with.  So Mississippi’s budget figure, I hope, will actually return back to normal here.  It continues to be one of the great myths of the Civil War, that Mississippi had to spend all this money on prosthetic limbs when the reality was very similar to what the few other state who even created the programs actually spent. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: There’s one group I want to make sure we talk about, because the whole time these guys are doing all of this, trying to get their paperwork filled out and, of course, they don’t make a whole lot of headway until almost the turn of the century, and in the interim in many cases they’re basically dependent on women at home.  You mentioned the disruption of prewar gender expectations.  Some of it seems to have come down just to numbers, with some twenty percent of the marriageable male population no longer available.  So women have to make adjustments, but they make a whole range of adjustments.  Would you say that overall Southern women formed a crucial bridge to the more formalized institutional support for veterans after they returned? </p>

<p><b>BCM</b>: Absolutely, I would definitely agree with that.  We think for these amputees themselves, the very first person that they’re going to interact with once they wake up from their amputation is probably a female nurse who has been assigned to give them medical care, change their dressings, and watch over them for a few weeks while they recover, before their return back to battle or the front lines or sent back home.  In some ways these nurses serve as the psychological gatekeepers for preparing these men for some of the challenges that they may face.  As these amputees are recovering, they take a lot of time to think about what an injury means to them in the future.  They begin worrying, in particular, about how their fiancées, or potential spouses back home, or their current spouse, are going to react to this injury.  It seems time and time again that the nurses themselves are telling these men, “everything is going to be ok, show your fiancée, your wife, your empty sleeve, show them your wound.  They will embrace you, they will love you all the more.”  In some cases as these men are recovering in the hospital, they’re getting mail, so we have nurses having to break the news that their fiancée or spouse has actually sustained a major injury, one that will alter their ability to maybe be a breadwinner for the household itself.  </p>

<p>The Lost Cause has this thing that every single Southern woman rose to the challenge and accepted these men.  I actually found it to be a mixed bag early on.  You have some women who were very enthusiastic, very excited about taking care of amputated men.  There are others who are not so interested, particularly those who want a fully able-bodied man, because that is how they see their ability to care, to survive in the future.  Other women simply become physically repulsed by the sight of men who have been physically altered by the war.  I don’t think we can blame those particular women because they are part of a culture and a society in the mid-nineteenth century that was in many ways Barnham’s world, where those were physically altered or handicapped became sideshow attractions.  They were individuals who were gawked at or stared at or ridiculed by the general public, so it shouldn’t surprise us as historians that these men now, who are veterans, happened to be viewed in the same way by some of their potential spouses. </p> 

<p>It seems that as time passes and these men come home, that for the most part they <i>are</i> embraced by women who have no choice other than to sort of help pick up the pieces.  They heed, in some ways, Jefferson Davis’ call near the end of the war to help build up the amputee as the “new aristocracy,” mostly out of sheer desperation to readjust to society.  If you fell in love with a man when he went off to war, you certainly understood the risks and when he returned missing an arm or leg, for the most part women, again, accepted that man in that new position.  We see cases of women who were very vigilant in caring for their amputated spouses, others who took them out every morning and tied them to the plow so they could actually do the fieldwork for the day.  Others found this prospect to be slightly exciting and beneficial for their own relationships, because they felt that their husbands or fiancées would not leave them.  “Who else could love an amputated man better than myself,” these women would start to argue.  In fact, some relished this newfound dependency that their husbands would now have on them, in many ways, as they had been dependent on their husbands prior to the Civil War.  It’s from those efforts in particular that we see women in that familial role of lifting these men back up or at least providing them medical care.  They become the stand-ins for the state governments that are slow to react, or the lack of healthcare system that’s readily available for these veterans as they return home and adjust to their newfound disabilities. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: Of course there’s one more group that undergoes a massive transformation over the course of the war, and that’s the surgeons.  It was really striking to me that you have these soldiers and also the untrained nurses, maybe from rural Arkansas or Mississippi or Louisiana or wherever, and they think so little of the surgeons that they feel that their own opinions on whether amputation is necessary or not hold more weight, even as the surgeons themselves are very carefully developing and documenting and standardizing best practices.  Although it does seem like there were certainly cases where the worst perceptions of wartime medicine were accurate, that actually instances of really saw-happy surgeons, and utter disregard for cleanliness, and incompetent post-operation care, those don’t really represent the typical standard of Civil War medicine.  So how is that our impression still today, has become so skewed?  Because of all of these groups that undergo real transformations, surgeons’ reputations don’t seem to come out of the other end of the war much better than they went in. </p>

<p><b>BCM</b>: I think there are a few reasons for that.  First of all, popular culture has done some damage to Civil War surgeons.  Think of any major Civil War film, going all the way back to <i>Gone with the Wind</i>, where the surgeon is sort of viewed in this negative light.  He’s more Sweeney Todd than a skilled individual, hacking away at the bodies, calling for the next patient/victim, hacking off the limb, tossing it, and then just screaming “next!” as they wipe the saw or knife on their blood-spattered apron.  That, I think, also parallels with some of the very negative impressions early on in the war.  If you look at any sort of general narrative history of the American Civil War, these big one-volume narratives that have been written, usually when you get to the section on medicine, or the medical crisis, a lot of the quotes pertaining to doctors, both Union and Confederacy, usually are lifted from 1861-1862.  We can’t blame those diary writers and letter writers because that is the horror that they’re seeing for the very first time.  They don’t have much of a frame of reference.  We’re talking about men and women who probably have never seen an operation before.  They certainly had not experienced any sort of major medical surgery in their life or been into a location where that had taken place, so when they walk by a battlefield hospital or they’re serving as a nurse in a battlefield hospital, they’re going to hear people screaming, they’re going to hear cries, they’re going to see limbs being cut off.  The only thing they can think of is to use the term “butcher.”  Now we think of the term butcher as back in those days as requiring some skill.  Even today, when you go to Whole Foods or Kroger and you go talk to your butcher behind the counter, you’re going to have him cut a piece of meat in a very skilled manner so it looks great, and so butchers themselves back then were doing very skilled work, but observers had no other frame of reference, so that was the term.  It comes up again and again and again, particularly in ’61 and ’62, and these accounts were written about these surgeons or the hospital experience in general.  It has been cast, when combined with popular culture, in a very negative light.</p>  

<p>In some ways I think surgeons rightfully earned that label, but only early in the war, because they were so overwhelmed, they were understaffed.  You’re talking about hundred of gunshot wounds, thousands when you’re looking at the aftermath of Shiloh, with a limited number of medical personnel, a limited amount of time, and in many cases they simply did not know what to do with that many wounded.  Once that storm calms a bit in the early part of the war, we start to see more standardization of practices, more medical literature readily available, and there it seems the medical practice really makes profound steps forward.  We have cases of surgeons who are clearly understanding germ theory well before we have given them credit for in the historical community.  Doctors are employing cleanliness standards in battlefield hospitals or in recovery units.  Nurses themselves are starting to understand the necessity for cleanliness and regularly changing dressings or following protocol where floors have to be scrubbed and cleaned in a certain way after a certain amount of time has passed.  In some ways when we negatively castigate these surgeons or hospital workers, we’re actually shredding their credibility, their honor, where they had taken up very honorable profession and did their best. While we have a lot of source material negatively blaming these surgeons in 1861-62, I was able to find quite a bit of praise-worthy material, particularly of patients who ran into their surgeon later in life, and thanked them for saving their life.  Those are the stories that don’t necessarily get into those grand narratives of the Civil War, and they certainly don’t make it into the Hollywood, pop culture views of the medical practice. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: So by the time we turn the clock again and get back up to the turn of the [twentieth] century, and women caregivers have been stand-ins for quite some time.  There have been the benevolent societies and we’re starting to get some incipient state programs.  But the foundation of support is really still too small, especially as these veterans get older.  By contrast, Northern veterans, by the 1890s, support for Northern veterans I think accounted for something in the neighborhood of forty percent of spending.  At the same time, Southern states are still debating whether individual support is undignified and maybe they should all go into these underfunded veterans’ homes.  So while there is some emerging systematic support, it’s coming after a lot of the veterans have died, and it’s really kind of, as you mentioned earlier, a very mixed actual result for the veterans.  What do you think was the legacy of their efforts, and the efforts of the women and of the benevolent societies, who championed on the veterans’ behalf? </p>

<p><b>BCM</b>: I would say it’s a very mixed legacy.  Unfortunately, I think this is a mixed legacy after every major American conflict.  I don’t think that the Civil War stands alone here.  If we look at recent events, you know, a few years ago with the issues at Walter Reed Medical Center or with the backlog of paperwork that veterans are having to wait to see a doctor at the V.A.  This seems to be a sad, persistent theme in American history, that after every major conflict, we sort of turn the page in the textbook, I like to say.  The war ends, we turn the page, and we move on to the next chapter in history, not really taking the time to understand the complexity of what these veterans, and those who were directly connected to them, have to deal with on a daily basis.  The benevolent organizations themselves, in the South, try their best, are overwhelmed, then sort of turn their attention elsewhere, such that caring for the wounded may not have been in their minds the larger legacy, as opposed to decorating graves and constructing monuments and writing textbooks.  That telling the story of the war becomes more a pertinent issue for these benevolent groups than taking care of the human beings who survived the war itself.  The state governments drag their feet.  Some of them take a long time to actually get to a place where they put up a financial commitment for these veterans, by which time many have passed away or are no longer interested in seeking out financial support.  A lot of them will just write in that they are in a place where they simply need help, and when the government was unable to do so, we’re left as historians to wonder what happens to them, if that’s the only paper trail that they leave behind.  </p>

<p>I think that the story of the veterans themselves becomes a problematic one in the sense that we don’t have enough material, if you will, to sort of glean what their experiences were really like, other than these sort of grand narratives that the benevolent organizations like the Daughters of the Confederacy, or the Ladies Memorial Association, or the United Confederate Veterans wrote.  They wrote very grandiose things about these men, and they wrote very grandiose things about the nurses who cared for them, but that rhetoric doesn’t necessarily seem to match when you go to pension files and prosthetic limb applications that show injured men in such dire straits that they are begging state legislators, they are begging governors.  You look at some of the governors’ files related to some of the prosthetic limb programs or pension programs, and there’s usually a folder full of letters written by the veterans saying, “I need help.  I don’t need help next week or next month, I need help immediately because there’s nowhere for me to go,” and I think tragically that continues to be a legacy of American military conflicts where we have veterans today who are still begging for help, who are having to live under bridges or are homeless, who don’t have the medical care that they need.  That sad mixed legacy I think for Confederate veterans, and even Union veterans as some historians have pointed out, even continues today. </p>

<p><b><i>Civil War Book Review (CWBR)</i></b>: Today the Civil War Book Review is happy to speak with Craig A. Warren, Associate Professor of English and Professional Writing at Penn State Erie, the Behrend College. Professor Warren previously authored <i>Scars to Prove It: The Civil War Soldier and American Fiction</i>, and today we get to discuss his most recent book, <i>The Rebel Yell: A Cultural History</i>. Professor Warren, thank you for joining us today. </p>

<p><b>Craig A. Warren</b>: Thanks for having me, I appreciate it. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: We always start out by asking because it's always an interesting question, especially in this case with this subject that hasn't been in historiography for quite some time, what was it that drew you to this project? </p>

<p><b>Warren</b>: I became really interested in the rebel yell in the summer of 2008. At that time my first book had just gone to press. To a large extent that book is about the memoirs of Civil War veterans and southern women on the home front. I came away from that project tremendously impressed by the ability of everyday Americans to put on the page some of the abstractions of war. Things such as freedom, democracy, and human dignity. I also became aware of where these writers struggled to represent certain phenomena in print and to communicate it to the reader. One of those areas, interestingly enough, was the legendary battle cry of Confederate soldiers, the rebel yell, and I saw writers struggling to represent it on the page. Some were trying to spell it out with vowels, consonants, and exclamation marks etc. That didn't satisfactorily convey this ferocious battle cry to the reader. Others adopted different strategies by using metaphor, saying the rebel yell sounded like the squealing brakes of a runaway train, or it sounded like the howling of wolves, and even a hurricane. This was not satisfying either since these three things don't necessarily sound alike. Also a frame of reference we are familiar with doesn't seem to connect with a Civil War battlefield. Then some just gave up altogether, which my favorite was the Union veteran and writer Ambrose Bierce who simply said the rebel yell was, “the ugliest sound that any mortal have ever heard.” I saw these different attempts to describe the rebel yell, all of which failed to a large extent. As a literary critic I was interested in the limitations of language to describe a sonic phenomenon, but as a cultural historian I quickly became interested in the rebel yell for other reasons as well. The more I looked into it the more I realized it had this really rich and vibrant career after the Civil War, all through Reconstruction and the Gilded Age and the early twentieth century. I think that's a history that most people still today are completely unaware of. That really got me interested to dig and understand the yell better, and to understand its evolving meaning and purposes for subsequent generations of Americans. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: I do want to come back to the sonic aspect and the limitations of the language, but before we get into all the details maybe it would be helpful to have a quick overview of the career the yell had that you mentioned. You found that it started from unclear but probably varied origins, to become what we are familiar with historically as a particular battle cry, but it changes a lot even after that. </p>

<p><b>Warren</b>: That's right. As with any human language or expression the rebel has, as you say, murky origins. Everything evolves from a complicated matrix and linguists do their best to patch together where human languages come from and how they evolve and change. It seems that the Antebellum South was absolutely awash with different kinds of high pitched yelling. Some was related to animal husbandry calling to animals, shepherding animals. Some had to do with rural life, communicating with neighbors and family members over long distances. There were also hunting cries used by every class strata in the Antebellum South. Then there were Native American war cries which could be heard through the 1830's and in some frontier communities in the south. Over a period of time it seems that all these different sounds and styles of noisemaking change how southern communities, in a broad sense, approached standard cheering. Unlike in northern populations and communities where cheering typically took the form of noisemaking in unison in a standard way like 'Hoorah, hoorah,' it seemed that in the South, both in town and in rural communities, cheering took the sound of free-form screeching, overlapping noises usually at a high pitch, lacking words or word sounds. When the Civil War began, it seems to me that this style of cheering just came naturally to most folks in the South, and was translated from a civilian life to the battlefield, the camp, and the march. It's sort of a mistake to think the rebel yell was exclusively a phenomenon to the battlefield. Southern troops used it in lots of different ways and in different contexts. In any case it became a battle cry and as you were saying after the war, it did change. For a long time was seen as a, I would say, kind of defiant statement of white southerners that they were still here and living through Federal occupation, but they were not foregoing their traditions. It was used in some cases of racial violence against freedmen. It was used in scenes of insurrection. The Crescent City White League, a white paramilitary organization was using the rebel yell while battling troops in blue in New Orleans. It was used in political contexts whenever different political parties would get their candidates together. The rebel yell was often sounded by old Confederate veterans now in support of new political measures. This goes on through the Spanish American War, and I don't know how much you want me to get into its career as a battle cry in 1898, but it's a major sociopolitical barometer of intersectional hostility in some cases, but also reconciliation as well. It's not until the twentieth century that we see the rebel yell eclipsed by the Confederate battle flag as a major symbol of white southern identity. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: One thing that struck me, going back to the origins of the yell, was this odd obsession, given how familiar most southerners would have been with all the different possibilities for its origins—whether it be Indian battle cries or hunting calls, anything like that—with figuring out a single source, and I was curious about that. </p>

<p><b>Warren</b>: Yeah, I think its human nature. We like to be detectives to try and find out the one single place where a particular expression began or where particular human behavior started. Really I think that's fool’s gold, there’s not going to be, when it comes to human language, one single beginning for virtually anything. I think that what happened with that obsession during the decades following the Civil War, with the origin of rebel yell, was that a lot of people began to understand the rebel yell existed somehow as the voice of the South.  That's how it was often characterized. That being the case, anyone who had a particular political or cultural agenda and wanted to represent true southern identity as belonging to a particular region, people, class, or political party would adopt the rebel yell as their own and try to make the case for its origins falling in line with their personal interests. For instance, if you wanted represent the South as this romantic, agrarian, cavalier society then you make the argument that, “oh the rebel yell derived from the fox-hunting cries of plantation owners.” If you instead want to make the case of true southern identity is in that blue collar work ethic of yeoman farmers then you say, “well the rebel yell derives from rabbit hunting calls that these farmers would voice after tending their fields during the daytime.” If you want to represent the South as a multi-racial society then you say, “oh it derives from Native American battle cries” or you suggest even that the rebel yell—ironically enough—began with slave songs and celebrations and those were passed on to their white masters. I guess what I'm getting at is the rebel yell becomes a political or cultural chess piece. People interested in trying to define the South in a particular way are going to interoperate its origins accordingly. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: In defining its origins it also, it was interesting to me, generates quite a bit more commentary than I had read anywhere else on how it was that northern soldiers supposedly cheered as well. </p>

<p><b>Warren</b>: That became something that for us today is kind of amusing, to see northern and southern veterans crossing pens after the war describing the difference between northern battle cries and southern. Northern troops seem to yell in a European and British style which is a low register, in unison, give a 'hoorah, hoorah.' They said this is the manly, deep-breasted cheer of the northern soldier. They all did it in unison and that sits very well with the concept of Union and togetherness. The southern veterans though, thought that was all clockwork and mechanical. They thought that kind of cheering was appropriate for northern factory workers who never saw sunlight and never got outside or had any individualism at all. They prized the rebel yell and said, here’s a battle cry which each individual contributed his own preferred pitch and sequence of sounds to the collective whole, and it's not a kind of cheering by rows, but instead free-form screeching, and all that overlapping sound creates a unified cacophony. The different sides found ways to talk about their style and mood of cheering as a way to describe their political approach to conflict and democracy. Are we representing a united front or are we each doing our own thing together? I think that's really interesting symbolically. There’s a lot to be said about how the rebel yell was different from the style of cheering in other sections of the U.S. and in Europe at the time. I think it does speak to the fact that the American South, although it had lots of shared characteristics and origins with the North, did have different cultural attitudes and origins owing to its region and to its people, which white southerners were encountering in the generation leading up to this whole war. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: It is interesting to me that these northern veterans and southern veterans, as they’re sort of sparring in various written pieces, are more or less in agreement on what makes a northern yell different from a southern yell, it's just they disagree on whether this is a good or bad thing, in their characteristics. Yet both interpretations lend themselves pretty readily to the growing Lost Cause ideology of the South being overcome by this tremendously more numerous, more industrial force, and really the ideology goes out of the equation. </p>

<p><b>Warren</b>: Right, I think that what happens over time is that as the two sections move towards reconciliation there becomes this need for mutual respect. Northern veterans instead of saying, “oh this high pitched rebel yell was effeminate, or it was wild and incoherent, and it represents everything that was wrong with secession,” began instead to praise the rebel yell as a unique American voice, voiced by a worthy opponent who, “though defeated in battle, nonetheless had lots of virtues in term of honor and dedication and commitment to cause.” If it does get discussion, the rebel yell gets incorporated into this drive towards reconciliation, which was not shared by everyone by any means, but in large contours there’s this movement towards reconciliation. It gets to the point where after a while, you begin to see the rebel yell embraced by people in the north and northern readers and newspapers are writing to southerners asking if they can describe the rebel yell in print or help them to better understand it. It becomes almost a kind of shared American achievement and I noted earlier that it took part in the Spanish-American War. By 1898, I would suggest the rebel yell became the de facto battle cry of the U.S. military. It was used on San Juan Hill and then the Philippines and elsewhere, taught to Northern troops and even African American troops by Southerners. After the war former Northern officers coming back to Washington D.C. in 1898 were serenaded by the rebel yell at the nation’s capital, which must have been really disorienting for them considering their previous experience with it, but it had become a national battle cry. I think you are right to say that it is an evolving experience and its meaning for the nation, and not just for the South, changes over time. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: That Spanish-American war moment was particularly striking, because it really does look for a moment that the rebel yell is going to become a newly fully incorporated American military tradition and it's going to be that shared American achievement you mentioned. All signs point to increased popularity, then what? Two or three years later it retreats, what happened? </p>

<p><b>Warren</b>: I think there was no longer the urgency on the part of white Southerners to prove their loyalty to the larger United States. That is what a lot of rhetoric was about during the Spanish-American War. People are saying, “oh look how the South is now sending its officers and men to support the United States and now they're wearing the blue uniforms as well and so forth.” After the Spanish-American War I think that Southern loyalty has been proven, so there's not this urgency in the part of the South to share the rebel yell with the North, so I think that's one of the reasons why there’s this retreat of its use. I also think that by the turn of the century, and I say this in the book, the rebel yell is no longer a military phenomenon. By then it’s been used and practiced by subsequent generations of civilians, people whose fathers and grandfathers had been Civil War soldiers and had taught that to them. We start seeing it also used in political spheres, the term rebel yell becomes an expression that's used to denote certain political perspectives. It's just not strictly a military phenomenon anymore and I talk about its growing demilitarization after 1898. So for me the Spanish-American War represents its zenith as a shared national battle cry and after the rebel yell, both screeching and name brand of the rebel yell, moves increasingly to the civilian sector. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: Was it the civilian sector then that was most responsible for the fact that, as we get past the Spanish-American War, you start to describe these multiple personalities for the rebel yell, so that there's still a Southern defiant yell that especially comes out in as a result of the Civil Rights movement, but then there’s also what you called a “cartoon yell?” </p>

<p><b>Warren</b>: Yeah, you know it's true. Once it's no longer seen as this terrifying ferocious battle cry, as it was described immediately after the war (veterans were writing about it in those terms), people begin to see it as an expression of life and vitality. People talk about the rebel yell as what Walt Whitman would call a “barbaric yawp,” declaring oneself’s place in the universe. It becomes something that screamed out at sporting events and race tracks. It becomes a fun-loving expression. Certainly during the Civil Rights movement the mid-twentieth century, segregationists started using the rebel yell in a throwback way as during the Civil War itself, but at the same time there's what I call the cartoon rebel yell was firmly placed as the sort of teenage hijinks yell, screeching out while driving 90 miles per hour down a country lane. It has multiple personas all at once, which is one of the reasons why I thought it was such an interesting phenomenon. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: We also cannot talk about its change without discussing the context of what might be replacing it. So especially when we are getting into the Civil Rights era, and the visual aspect is so important there, you write that that’s true as well for how the yell is regarded, right? </p>

<p><b>Warren</b>: The rebel yell, we have to remember, emerged from the nineteenth century. It's invisible, intangible, just really much more at home in a culture that was oriented toward sound. There are critics that have done a great job about talking about how sound was so important to nineteenth century America. That's one reason why today we have a hard time understanding why people would go and listen to three-hour-long oratory, but that was something that was part of their culture, perhaps especially in the South. As we get in the twentieth century, especially after World War II, we are now in a culture of images, with the advent of televisions and motion pictures. Increasingly people are looking for visual symbols culturally and politically. What happens, to my mind, is that the rebel yell is no longer as much at home in that kind of society. So the use of the yell as the dominant symbol of white southern identity is eclipsed by that Confederate battle flag, which had largely gone dormant from about 1865 to 1948 or so, when the Dixiecrats adopted it and it started beginning to be used for other purposes. John Coski's excellent book <i>The Confederate Battle Flag</i> charts this evolution about how the battle flag was largely used just in ceremonial ways through Reconstruction in the Gilded Age, but really came into its own as a controversial and important symbol around 1950. That was helpful for me because I began to see how in his description of the career of the battle flag, how it was following many of the same contours we had seen the career of the rebel yell established. I began to ask what the difference here is. Well one major difference is that the flag is visible and it’s more dignified to be suited for a governor's office or for a state capital than the rebel yell, which is more of a ragged, raw expression of self. The rebel yell is better suited for a street fight than for a governor's office. I think that's one reason why we see the battle flag eclipsing the yell as a major symbol right around 1948-50. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: It's not too long after that, that it seems to me like the yell experiences an effort to re-imbue it with a bit of the original ferocity and gravitas that it originally had. You mentioned there’s another personality, the “lost yell.” </p>

<p><b>Warren</b>: It's true, it wasn't that there was a clear passing from the yell towards the flag. There was an overlap for a while, the same places the segregationists are waving the Confederate battle flag such as from University of Mississippi in 1962 when James Meredith was enrolling. At the same time that those flags are being waved, protestors were also shouting the rebel yell. There is this throwback, but at the same time there is this new movement to which I refer to as the concept of the “myth of the lost yell,” which suggests that the rebel yell has been lost to history. That began with a handful of Confederate veterans at the end of the nineteenth century who didn't like how the rebel yell was being used by civilians. They thought it was being treated irreverently, and used as a party trick.   They wanted it to be treated as a dignified anthem for a particular time and place, the Confederacy of 1861-65. They wanted to cordon it off from its irreverent use and said, “Oh it's been lost forever and you can never hear it after Appomattox.” Lots of other veterans, though, were demonstrating the rebel yell quite willingly at banquets. The argument about the lost yell never got a lot of traction until most veterans passed away. Then people like Shelby Foote, who had a particular cultural agenda, began pushing again the concept of the lost yell. Over time people began to embrace the idea that “we may have a facsimile of the rebel yell today but we really don’t know exactly how it sounded but the true rebel yell has been lost,” so you see this movement as well. I think what Shelby Foote and others were trying to do was to distance the rebel yell from what they would see as its abuses in the mid-twentieth century. They didn't like the KKK using the Confederate battle flag during the Civil Rights Movement, or the segregations using the rebel yell, which made them think that it was spoiling what these nineteenth century artifacts had been used for initially, and they should not dishonor them in that way. They suggested that these things are actually dead and gone forever. They said that the rebel yell, like Southern oratory had been lost. I suggest in my book that it’s a myth and that there's never been a time since 1865 when we haven't had Confederate veterans willingly give up the rebel yell, or that we haven't had any recordings, audio and visual, of Confederate veterans giving the rebel yell. The idea that it was lost to history is really part of a particular agenda, but it's not a reality. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: Well the recordings that you mention became this really fascinating part of the book where you did quite a bit of sleuthing to dig a little bit into various efforts that have now been made with the miracle of digital technology and what not, to have now a “found yell.” </p>

<p><b>Warren</b>: Exactly, I think when Shelby Foote went on Dick Cavett in the 1970's and talked with Ken Burns in that famous PBS documentary <i>The Civil War</i> in 1990, we didn't have the World Wide Web yet, on which we could share recordings with the entire world, so it was easier than to make the case that the rebel yell has been lost and we don’t have any recordings of it. Now that kind of thing can be shared. There was an effort on the part of the Museum of the Confederacy a few years back to try and uncover what they were putting forward as the true yell. They were following the tradition that there had only been one way to give a rebel yell, that everyone who gave the yell did it in the exact same way. There's no historical record to back that up, but they latched on to that idea. They found a recording the United Daughters of the Confederacy had and then another one across the country thinking they were two separate recordings that lined up and uncovered the true yell. What I do is go through a lot of UDC catalogs and find different radio stations who played recordings of the yell over the last several decades and try to show that actually the Museum of Confederacy found the same recording twice. It wasn't a one true yell that was offered by different guys and units, but actually the same recording. I hope that what I have done in looking at that and trying to figure out exactly what's been recorded and when or who by, is that there was no true way of giving the rebel yell. Every soldier has his own preferred way of doing it, and I would suggest every soldier gave a slightly different rebel yell from one occasion to the next. So the found yell was really that realization, that there was no one way to do it and the fact that we now have the World Wide Web and technology is better to share those kinds of things. We can look at what the Library of Congress has, to look at their audio and visual recordings of Confederate veterans giving an individual yell or collective yells. This is available now at the Smithsonian website actually. I like to think now we can get past a lot of the myths that have grown around the rebel yell and better understand its real evolution for what it means for our country. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: So what do you see as the importance of the historical debate over the yell as its going on into the twenty-first century, trading its particular historical meaning in our culture for symbolizing a more general rebelliousness? </p>

<p><b>Warren</b>: One think I learned from this process is that often times passes for history is really an attempt by various commentators to shape the thinking of generations of Americans about American history or Southern history in this case. Really the job of the scholar is to look at different interpretations of the past or cultural artifacts and try to approach it in that sort of neutral objective way, and see how these markers have been used to front a particular agenda, and to understand how American culture develops overtime in accordance with these perspectives that are maybe politically motivated or culturally or socially motivated. In terms of what I've learned about the yell’s shift from one particular use on a battlefield for instance for being used for commercial purposes and everything else, it's that a cultural icon really cannot be contained. Shelby Foote and others might want us to say that this artifact is lost forever and lost to history, but cultural artifacts are not lost. They evolve over time, they change over time. You see this when Billy Idol can use the rebel yell—this British rocker having it on a song or an album—or whenever the rebel yell is used now as a name for a clothing line or bourbon. You see how these things can be commercialized, how symbols can change and be adopted for new purposes and new agendas. I think that's the truth in how we approach symbols as people, and to understand that about our images and symbols is important, because it makes us more aware of who we are and how we choose to represent ourselves to the world. </p>

<p>
<b><i>Civil War Book Review (CWBR):</b></i> Today, I’m joined by Eric Foner who is DeWitt Clinton Professor of History at Columbia University to discuss his Pulitzer Prize-winning <i>The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery</i>.  Professor Foner, congratulations on your award and thank you for joining me.</p>
<p>
<b>Eric Foner (EF):</b> Thank you very much; I'm happy to talk to you</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> What inspired you to take this approach to looking at Abraham Lincoln?</p>
<p>
<b>EF:</b> Well obviously, as you know, there are enumerable books about Lincoln out there already, many of them are, of course excellent books.  I feel that in recent years, with some important exceptions, there's been a tendency in some of the literature to sort of focus so specifically on Lincoln that the wider world slips from view sometimes, that, in a sense, my feeling is Lincoln needed to be put back in political context, particularly in this one area: that my book is about Lincoln and slavery; it's not a total biography.  It's about Lincoln and the evolution of his ideas about slavery, policies about slavery, and I did feel that there was still something to be said tracing out how Lincoln’s attitudes and views changed over the course of his life: how he related to other people in the whole broad anti-slavery firmament.  So, I guess, I felt there was room even though there is such a large body of literature already about slavery, about Lincoln</p> 
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> You mention placing him in that overall world and I wonder: is seems like you suggest that we can often see certain aspects of Lincoln in ourselves.  Does examining the personal  growth during his life, in terms of how he looked at government, slavery, and society, make him more approachable?  Does it remove some of the mystique, making him more human?</p>
<p>
<b>EF:</b> Well, I hope so.  I mean Lincoln was a man of greatness; he grew into greatness.  I don't think he was a great figure for all of his life and I think we can learn something from how Lincoln related to broad social movements of his time: abolitionism, other forms of critique of slavery, which he was not really part of, but he was willing to learn from them, and I think just the notion of a statesman who is open to new ideas, who is intellectually curious, who is willing to change-of course, in the greatest crisis in our nation’s history- is something we can learn from: that people should not be totally set in their ways, totally inflexible.  Today, if a politician changes his view about something he is immediately denounced as a flip-flopper, right?  Lincoln was a flip-flopper; he changed enormously, in some regards: in terms of policy about slavery, attitudes about race.  Another way of putting it is he learned, he grew, he understood that new ideas were valuable.  So the notion today seems to be that anyone who learns anything, that's to be criticized and condemned because they're not holding exactly the same positions throughout their whole life.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> How important was an ideological base in Revolutionary politics and the ideology of the Founding Fathers to Lincoln’s political foundation?</p>
<p>
<b>EF:</b> Well Lincoln, of course, greatly admired the founding fathers as most people of his generation did.  In that famous Lyceum speech when he was still a young man in the late 1830s, he sort of said, well what have the Founding Fathers left for us to do, so to speak?  They created this, what he considered the last, best hope of man, this democratic system of government, and, in a sense, they had usurped what subsequent generations might do to achieve notoriety and greatness.  But ,of course, Lincoln felt that-he believed-(this is open to some criticism) but he believed that the founders had set the country on a course toward the eventual abolition of slavery and he felt that their policies were being overturned particularly in the 1850s by Stephen A. Douglas and those pressing for the expansion of slavery.  And so, on the one hand, Lincoln claims to be, in a sense, a conservative; he's going back to the original purposes of the revolution.  But, in doing so, you're radically altering the system that has existed since that time.  He said that the nation cannot exist forever half slave and half free.  Well, it had existed half slave and half free for well over 50 years.   So on the one hand he says he's going back to the views of the founders; on the other hand he's really trying to change the fundamental nature of American society because of his anti-slavery commitments.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> Well placing Lincoln, then, in the overall society, did Lincoln’s unique upbringing in Kentucky and Illinois, on the edge of slaveholding society, give him a distinctive perspective into intersectional politics and dealing with the South during secession and war?</p>
<p>
<b>EF:</b>  Well, of course, Lincoln, as you well know, was born in Kentucky, a slave state.  He grew up in southern Indiana and then southern and central Illinois, areas settled mostly, at that time, by people from the South.  He married into a Kentucky family, so he obviously had very close personal connections with the South and, in some ways, with slave society.  And I think that that gave him a sense of…he didn't denounce southerners.  He didn't denounce slave owners the way some abolitionists did; he never said that they are sinners, that kind of thing.  In fact, he said in one of his speeches that if we were in their position we would be pretty much doing the same things they are.  But I think that during the war one of his problems may have been, at least in the secession crisis, that he overestimated the degree of support for the Union in the South.  He sort of felt that secessionism was a minority movement, was almost like a conspiracy of a small group.  And he believed that there was this strong latent Unionism in the South that would eventually rear its head and end secession.  That, of course, did not turn out to be the case so maybe, in that sense, on the one hand, his personal connections with southerners made him less likely to engage in a kind of vitriolic denunciation; on the other hand it may have led him to overestimate the degree of Unionism.  After all Kentucky was not your typical slave state: Kentucky remained in the Union, it was divided his wife's family, his father-in-law ,who died in 1849 I think, was strongly pro-Union.  Henry Clay, the great Kentucky statesman who Lincoln admired so much, was pro-Union and Lincoln may have somewhat extended those views to the rest of the South in a way that didn't turn out to be totally accurate. </p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> Once Lincoln was elected, was there an honest opportunity for compromise in your opinion?</p>
<p>
<b>EF:</b> You know, it's interesting,  Lincoln admired Cay enormously but Clay made his reputation, of course, as the Great Compromiser.  Lincoln, in the secession crisis, refused to compromise.  He said he is perfectly willing to compromise on peripheral issues, but not on the core question which was the westward expansion of slavery.  On that, he said I am not compromising so Lincoln was willing to risk war even in the face in the secession crisis.  So I think Lincoln was able (and this is another lesson for statesmen) to clearly differentiate, in his own mind, between core principles, which he wouldn't compromise, and other issues which he was willing to compromise.  So, if Lincoln’s only aim, as some people seem to think was to preserve the Union, he could have easily preserved the Union by just giving in to the South, no problem.  Give the South what they want, let them expand slavery, and then the Union is saved.  What's the problem here?  But Lincoln said no; it must be a Union worth saving, a Union in which slavery is confined and put in, what he calls, the course toward ultimate extinction.  And that's your fundamental problem there; if you don't compromise on that you're not going to settle the secession crisis.</p>
<p>
<i><b>CWBR:</b></i> How does one reconcile the fact that many white southerners mark Lincoln’s election as a blow to slavery with the fact that many abolitionists like Garrison worry that Lincoln is not radical enough?  What does that tell us about the complicated task that Lincoln faced?</p>
<p>
<b>EF:</b> Lincoln was not an abolitionist; he didn't claim to be an abolitionist.  Abolitionists were often very critical of Lincoln.  On the other hand, people like Garrison, Wendell Phillips, and Frederick Douglas hailed Lincoln’s election as a step in the right direction.  They said no, this is not going to end slavery just like that, but it's definitely a step in the right direction.  Simon P. Chase, who was an abolitionist although a republican politician, says this is the culmination of my life’s work-Lincoln’s election-the slave power, southern slave owners, have been expelled from control of the federal government.  So, even though abolitionist felt Lincoln was not nearly as radical as they wanted, southerners (white southerners, secessionists) feared that Lincoln’s election marked a fundamental shift in power in the country.  They didn't think that Lincoln was going to sign an emancipation proclamation as soon as he came to office; he had no legal grounds for doing that, and he made it clear he wasn't going to do it.  But, in the longer run, this seemed to be to them a sign of the northern states now acquiring control of the national government and they felt slavery would not be safe ultimately under the rule of people who were hostile to slavery.  So that's why they seceded.  Read the South Carolina Declaration of the Causes of Secession, they don't beat around the bush; that's what they say: slavery is no longer safe with the election of Lincoln.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> What role did the Union military play in forcing Lincoln to define or clarify his policy on slavery and what role did the slaves themselves play in that?</p>
<p>
<b>EF:</b> At the outset of the war, of course, Lincoln says that this is not a war about slavery; it's a war about preserving the Union.  Four slave states, the Border States, remain in the Union; Lincoln was very concerned about maintaining their loyalty.  But very quickly the government has to take cognizance of slavery.  The first thing is slaves run away.  Wherever the Union Army goes, slaves start running toward Union lines and the army has got a dilemma.  At the beginning they start returning these slaves but many soldiers don't want to do that.  They're not in the army to be fugitive slave hunters and, moreover, many of those slaves have been used as laborers for the Confederate Army and why send them back to build fortifications against your own forces?  So this forces the Lincoln administration to start making policy about slavery and in 1861 they do it in a modest sort of way.  By 1862, in the spring when they capture the southern part of Louisiana, they're in control of an area with many, many thousands of slaves and so the slaves put the issue on the agenda so to speak by their own actions.  And then the army has to deal with it.  The army says: well what are we supposed to do?  We can't just start capturing slaves and sending them back; it is distasteful, it's counterproductive.  Sometimes slaves have very valuable information about the disposition of Confederate forces or the local terrain or things like that which they bring to Union commanders and they say: well we just can't send this guy back into slavery now that he's been helpful to us.  So that's a couple of, among many, of pressures that are pushing Lincoln toward a new policy on slavery. </p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> How did the Emancipation Proclamation alter the course of the war and might the Proclamation be indicative of a general shift toward total war?</p>
<p>
<b>EF:</b> Well I think the Proclamation does fundamentally change the nature of the war because it makes slavery officially a target of the Union war effort.  Henceforth, after January 1, 1863, wherever the Union Army goes, one of its responsibilities, as Lincoln says in that document, is to protect and maintain the freedom of about 3.2 million (more or less) slaves who were declared free under the terms of the Emancipation Proclamation.  So it guarantees that, if the Union wins the war (which, of course, is an “if;” it's not guaranteed) then slavery will end, no question about it.  Even though it doesn't apply to Kentucky, it doesn't apply to Maryland, if slavery dies in South Carolina, Mississippi, and Alabama, it's not going to be able to survive all that long in Missouri and Delaware.  So it really does change the nature of the war and, indeed, of American society.  It means that now the issue on the agenda is going to be: what is going to be the status of these millions of slaves who are now being declared free people?  What's going to happen to them in American society?  Are they going to enjoy the same rights as white people?  Are they going to be in the same labor system?  So it opens up a lot of important questions, even though it sort of points toward solving the question of slavery, per se and so I think it does very much change the nature of the war.  And also of course the Proclamation, for the first time, officially announces that black soldiers (black men) will be allowed to enlist in the Union Army and I think the service of the 200,000 black soldiers and sailors by the end of the war does have a very big effect on racial attitudes.  Even Lincoln, himself, comes to feel that these people who fought for the Union have stake to claim for citizenship in the post-war world.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> What effect did Lincoln’s increasing use of emancipation as a war aim, as the war progressed, have on public support leading up to the 1864 election?  Without Sherman’s victory at Atlanta, was a loss to McClellan possible?</p>
<p>
<b>EF:</b> Well certainly in August of 1864 Lincoln believed he was going to lose; many Republicans thought Lincoln was going to lose the election.  There was a great deal of war weariness in the North; casualties in 1864 were enormous compared to the rest of the war.  Even though there had been Union victories, important ones previously, (Gettysburg and Vicksburg) still it seemed to be a sort of stalemate in the East and there was a lot of fear that war weariness would lead to the election of General McClellan, the Democrat.  In August 1864 Henry Raymond, the editor of the <i>New York Times</i>, and some other Republicans came to Lincoln and said: people think the Emancipation Proclamation is prolonging the war because they'll never come back unless they can keep their slaves.  Why don't you say that we'll accept the South back with their slaves if they just give up the war?  Rescind the Emancipation Proclamation, basically, that will, at least boost, your chances of re-election because, if they say no, it will prove that the Proclamation is not the reason the war is continuing.  And Lincoln seems to have thought about it a bit over night but then he said: I can't really do that.  First of all, it would just be wrong to promise people freedom and then rescind the promise.  Second of all, we need those black soldiers; if we do this the black soldiers will lay down their arms and without them we can't win the war.  So he was wedded to emancipation by then, even at the possible price of losing the election.  Then, as you said, Sherman’s capture of Atlanta seems to have turned the tide in terms of public sentiment and he is elected eventually by a very large margin.  But basically once the Proclamation is issued, Lincoln is not going to go back on it and, even though some radicals thought he was too slow in issuing it, once it's issued, this is it.  This is now the policy of the Union and he is not going to change.</p> 
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> What was Lincoln’s vision for American society in the post-war period and how did his vision evolve or change from his antebellum ideas of an American society with or without slavery?</p>
<p>
<b>EF:</b> We know very little about what was Lincoln thinking about the post-war world; obviously he was assassinated April 1865 when Reconstruction is really just beginning.  There were various plans of Reconstruction put forward during the Civil War but these were plans for winning the war, not a blueprint for the post-war South.  And certainly, in his final speech, just before his death he talked about maybe limited black suffrage in the South, which is something he had never publicly spoken of before so I think his ideas were changing and evolving.   I don't think Lincoln had a blueprint at all.  I think he wanted a relatively quick reunion of the country; he was not vindictive toward white southerners.  On the other hand, I think he recognized, by this point, that the former slaves had a claim on the conscience of the nation and you couldn't just abandon them and let them be put back into some kind of system akin to slavery again.  How to work that out, how to bring the white South in and yet protect the rights of the black South was a gigantic dilemma which Congress will be wrestling with for several years after this.  Of course, the problem was that, once Lincoln is assassinated, you get probably the worst president in American history, Andrew Johnson, replacing him who is totally incapable of confronting this question at all in any serious way and that complicates the situation very dramatically.</p>

<p>
<b><i>Civil War Book Review (CWBR):</i></b> Today, I’m delighted to be joined by Gary Gallagher who is John L. Nau III Professor of History at the University of Virginia to discuss his most recent book <i>The Union War</i>.  Professor Gallagher, thank you for talking with us today.</p>
<p>
<b>Gary Gallagher (GG):</b> Thanks for inviting me.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> You mention in the acknowledgements that you came up with the idea for this book ten years ago; how did you decide to approach this question and look at a study of the Civil War through the concept of Union?</p>
<p>
<b>GG:</b> I began talking about the book ten years ago with Joyce Seltzer, who is the editor I worked with at Harvard on an earlier book, <i>The Confederate War</i>. But I’ve really been thinking about this for much longer than that. I’ve been thinking about it because I’ve found over the years perhaps the most difficult thing to explain to students, or groups of adults to whom I speak about the war, is why the loyal citizenry thought Union was worth fighting for.  It’s a very hard concept for many modern Americans to come to terms with: why would someone from Vermont who is under no direct threat, either their property or their system of local government, from the Confederates, why would they think it was worthwhile to put on a uniform and risk their lives to save the Union?  Union just doesn’t mean anything to us now, and it’s very hard to explain that to modern audiences.</p>
<p>  
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> I was especially intrigued by your discussion of language and vocabulary, particularly when you discuss how the word “Union” has essentially dropped from our current vocabulary but that it dominated the Civil War and antebellum period. Why do you suppose that is the case? What did Union truly mean to the wartime generation of soldiers and civilians?</p>
<p>
<b>GG:</b> I do think Union has gone out of our vocabulary, literally gone out of our vocabulary in terms of its mid-nineteenth-century meaning.  Union has a labor connation now; it has no tie to the way that it was used in the mid-nineteenth century.  In the mid-nineteenth century, Union and nation and country and United States were deployed as synonyms frequently; they’re interchangeable in a lot of the writings that you see in the mid-nineteenth century.  I think that part of the problem now is that Union, among that cluster of words, simply has dropped out. Now we think of nation, or we think of country.  And we take the nation for granted; we take all of the things for granted that were much more fraught in the mid-nineteenth century. We can’t imagine an internal threat to the United States of the sort that galvanized the loyal citizenry between 1861 and 1865.  Union is just a word that no longer has any meaning in that regard, and if we don’t have a sense of what that word means . . . I think Elizabeth Varon’s book from a couple of years ago, <i>Disunion</i>, helps get at the meaning of the word.  She talks about how important the word “disunion” was and, of course, disunion can only be an important word if Union is an even more important one.  Why was the idea of disunion so troubling to so many people?  Well, it’s because Union meant so much, and I think it meant a cluster of things.  It meant the legacy of the founding generation, the handiwork of the Philadelphia Convention, the small “R” republican form of government, the small “D” form of democracy; it meant a nation where common people had a voice in their own government--of course, we’re talking in a mid-nineteenth-century context, so that is to say white men had a voice in their government--and also had the ability to rise economically.  Lincoln spoke to this beautifully, in many ways during the war, but the really interesting and important thing to me is Lincoln is simply saying the same kinds of things--he says them better--but he is saying the same kinds of things that untold people are saying.  This place is unique in the Western World, the rest of the Western World is going in the wrong direction, advocates of Union believe.  They believe the failed revolutions of the 1840s show that the European nations were falling even more into the embrace of oligarchy and aristocracy and monarchy. In an American context, the slaveholding southerners represented oligarchs and aristocrats; unionists in the free states deploy those words constantly in referring to those who led the secession movement.  Everything they stood for, slaveholding oligarchs, was inimical to the work and promise of what the Founding Fathers had done from the perspective of those who really took Union seriously.  They also believed that Union had meaning beyond the United States.  It’s important for all of those reasons within the United States but beyond that, it’s important because, they would argue, that democracy had not at all been established in the Western World and if it fails here, it might be snuffed out entirely.  When Lincoln talks about the last, best hope of earth, that’s what he is talking about, but lots of other people used language very similar to that. So it has a Trans-Atlantic meaning, and it also has a meaning for those who lived in the United States: a profound meaning, something that would cause people to risk their lives.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> You admit, up front, the challenges that any scholar must overcome when looking at the motivations of the common soldier and/or the common population during wartime, especially given the tremendous amount of letters written during the American Civil War.  What sorts of obstacles did you face in trying to provide a broad enough scope to achieve a representation of the ways in which soldiers and civilians, alike looked at Union and the Civil War?</p>
<p>
<b>GG:</b> The key is, there’s so much evidence from the Civil War that you can argue anything.  You can take almost any position and argue it, and you can find evidence that supports what you want to argue.  I don’t just look at soldiers in this book, but common soldier testimony is so voluminous that I think the only way to come at it is to read as much as you can with the understanding that no scholar can read anything but the tiniest percentage. We’re talking about millions and millions of letters that the soldiers wrote, any scholar who reads 20 or 25,000 of them has done heroic labor in research.  But those 25,000 letters are statistically insignificant, and they cannot, in any way, be considered a real representative sample of soldiers’ sentiments.  So I think it’s important to place different kinds of evidence in conversation with one another.  Read as much as you can, pick out the themes in the letters that you’ve read, and then compare those to what you find elsewhere. There are other types of evidence you can use. In <i>The Union War</i>, I used patriotic covers, newspapers, song lyrics, and other things. I believe historians should use as many different kinds of evidence as possible--and when you have the array of different kinds of evidence, see if themes cross over from one kind to another.  That’s the way I think we have to come at this. Everything we do is imperfect; there’s just no way to get a perfect reading of what was going on.  But when I think that you look at an array of evidence, Union stands out. This includes the writings of Abraham Lincoln, who had as good a sense of what motivated the loyal population as anyone. He was an incredibly perceptive politician, and his public statements and statements designed to be leaked to the public, so to speak, first and last, spoke of a war for Union.  He says it in the beginning; he says it in his message to Congress after the 1864 Presidential Election. In the latter, he says, in every great war--I’m paraphrasing him--a people have to have one overriding goal and in this great war of ours, its Union.  Much of what he is talking about in that statement is a plea to pass the Thirteenth Amendment.  But in calling for that, he specifically says the Thirteenth Amendment—emancipation, killing slavery--will be one of the tools to help achieve the overriding goal of Union.  Even at that late stage of the war, he understood that, for most of the loyal citizenry, it’s still about Union.    Most of them had embraced emancipation by that time, not for the reasons we would want them to, not as a great moral crusade, but because they knew that emancipation would help to beat the Rebels, would punish the slaveholding oligarchs who caused all of the problems in the first place, and would create a better Union, an improved Union, a Union that didn’t have the poisonous issue of slavery sort of lurking in the national political scene to rise up and cause a problem such as that in the Secession Winter of 1860-61.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> If northerners were fighting for Union, does that mean southerners were fighting primarily for disunion and not states’ rights <b>or</b> slavery?</p>
<p>
<b>GG:</b> I think it’s very important to separate the issues that brought secession and what motivated people in the Confederacy during the war.  Those are two related issues, but they’re not the same thing.  Secession came because the cotton South believed that Abraham Lincoln’s election, the election of a Republican, posed a sufficient threat to the long-term stability of slavery to make secession a smart choice.  It’s all about slavery (secession is), absolutely, it’s all about slavery.  You take slavery out of the picture in 1860, and you don’t get secession. I see no way for secession without slavery.  I don’t think there can be any question about that, and I don’t think that any serious scholar does question that.  The fact that the Republicans had a plank in their platform that said they would leave slavery alone wherever it existed struck slaveholders as dishonest.  They knew that both Lincoln and Seward , the two most famous Republicans at that stage, had said, in very well-known speeches from 1858, that the nation couldn’t exist half-slave and half-free.  Slaveholders knew that both Lincoln and Seward wanted the nation to be all-free, and therefore they just didn’t trust this idea that Republicans wouldn’t strike at slavery wherever it was, never mind that they were going to block it in the territories.  So secession is all about slavery.  Once you get secession, once you get the cascading crises in the wake of that first round of seceding states, then other factors do come into play.  And I think motivations for actually supporting the Confederacy and going into the Confederate army were various, just as they were with the United States soldiers.  But I think protecting home ground, not being dictated to by the United States, those are very important. But Confederates talked, all the time, about preserving their way of life, preserving their country, preserving their homes, and all of those things are tied, inextricably, to the fact that they lived in a slaveholding society, in a society that gave them racial control over 3.5 million black people.  Slavery is important any way you look at this, but I think different kinds of motivations come into play in terms of what why soldiers went into the army for the Confederacy, for example.  But we have to take as a base line that the vast majority--you can’t say everybody because with millions of people there are always outliers--the vast majority of the white south, whether or not they owned slaves, had a profound interest in slavery as a means of race control, in addition to slavery as a means of economic control in some ways.</p>

<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> During Grant’s campaign, how did many northerners justify going through the trial of so many casualties?  It seems almost as if Grant gets a pass for the tremendous casualties.  Was it the promise of a stronger Union?</p>
<p>
<b>GG:</b> He didn’t get a pass from <i>all</i> citizens in the North.  A lot of the Democratic newspapers, especially the Copperhead kind of newspapers such as <i>The Old Guard</i>, were very hard on Grant.  Some of them began to call him a butcher; that’s mainly an epithet that was leveled against him by Confederate newspapers but some of the newspapers in the United States did so as well.  I think it was a measure of the devotion to Union that the citizenry <i>was</i> willing to put up with that level of loss in the spring and summer of 1864, although it was a close thing in the summer.  We always need to remind ourselves that United States victory was not pre-ordained.  The United States could have lost the war.  I think that more than once the Confederacy came close to meeting the test it needed to meet for success. The Confederacy had an easier test than the United States did.  All the Confederacy had to do—and Lee understood this very well--was persuade the civilian population of the United States that it wasn’t worth the cost. I think Overland Campaign pushed a significant part of the civilian population close to that point in the summer of 1864, from late June and through July and into August.  I think it was--of course this isn’t new with me--Sherman in Atlanta and Sheridan in the Shenandoah Valley that turned things around and re-elected Lincoln and the Republicans who, of course, had not run as Republicans in 1864.  They ran as the Union Party, which is another very clear indication of how important that concept was.  Let’s don’t even call ourselves Republicans, they said, we’ll bring in the greatest possible support if we call ourselves the Union Party.  It was close in the summer of 1864.  Grant did get some criticism; the person who was largely immune from criticism and a person who was a much bloodier general than Grant, first to last, was Lee.  That’s one of the interesting topics of the war.  We’re off-subject a bit, but Lee essentially was given a pass by the people of the Confederacy. That’s always fascinated me.</p>
<p>  
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> You seem to be arguing for a middle ground when you discuss the role that the Union Army played in emancipation, a coming together of opposing traditions (military and social).  How important is an understanding of both perspectives in the process of emancipation and the execution of the war?</p>
<p>
<b>GG:</b> There are several factors that have to be in any consideration of the process of emancipation, and it was a process.  Lincoln has to be in it; Lincoln’s absolutely one of the crucial factors.  Congress is very important, beginning with the first Confiscation Act in the summer of 1861 and moving through all of that legislation in the spring and summer of 1862.  And, of course, the actions of hundreds of thousands of enslaved people in the Confederacy are very important, the notion of self-emancipation that W.E.B. Dubois advanced in the mid-1930s and which has been picked up by any number of historians beginning in the late 1960s and coming down, most recently, through Steven Hahn and others now.  All of those are very important elements of the process, but my argument is the one that gets left out is the role of the United States Army.  If you take the United States Army out of the equation, you don’t get emancipation no matter what any of those other people want; it doesn’t matter.  If the United States Army doesn’t go somewhere, emancipation doesn’t go there either. It’s fascinating to look at the geography of emancipation in the Confederacy during the war.  Where are the roughly half-million enslaved people who actually achieved freedom during the war?  And I take this number from Ira Berlin’s project at Maryland, which I think is the gold standard in that regard; it’s about a half a million, about one in seven.  One in seven, where are they?  They’re where the United States Army went and stayed for a significant period of time: up and down the Mississippi River, the Lower Peninsula in Virginia, in significant parts of Tennessee, that’s where emancipation comes.  It comes where the army goes.  What is the degree of emancipation in Texas?  Virtually zero; the United States Army doesn’t get there, so it doesn’t matter how much an enslaved person wants to be free.  In Texas, there’s no chance because the army doesn’t come.  So I just think it’s very important to put the army, not only in the picture, but put the army very prominently in the picture.  And also, to make the point that it doesn’t even matter whether the soldiers in the army want emancipation to come or not.  A lot of them do; by the end of the war, I think most of them did, though again, not for the reasons we would want but they still did.  But even somebody who isn’t really for emancipation, an army commander who’s not really for emancipation--Sherman would be a good example of that--still acts as a destructive agent regarding slavery as he moves his army through central Georgia or wherever he’s going.  The army is absolutely critical to the process of emancipation.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> Stephanie McCurry’s most recent book suggests taking the slaves seriously in the ways in which they negotiated freedom, that they had to navigate a difficult environment when the Union army came marching through the Confederate countryside.  How might your findings complement or contradict the concept of the slave as an active player in emancipation?</p>
<p>
<b>GG:</b> I don’t contradict it at all.  I think that enslaved people <i>did</i> play an active role when they were in a situation where they could.  I’ll just come back to my earlier point; the situation has to be one where there is the possibility of freedom, and that possibility of freedom lies in the presence of a United States military force near enough at hand to make the decision for freedom one that was attainable.  It might still be very difficult to get to Union lines, it often was, but they had to be close enough to get there.  So I see no inherent contradiction at all between the idea of an enslaved people working hard to achieve their own emancipation and the fact that the United States Army was crucial in allowing them to do so.  I see no contradiction there; it’s just that I would argue that it doesn’t matter how much an enslaved person wants to be free, they cannot be free within the context of the Civil War unless the conditions are appropriate and the crucial factor is: has the United States Army come close enough to make it possible?</p>
<p> 
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> David Blight has become the staple for looking at postbellum reconciliation.  Does recognition of slavery and its abolition as major war motivations or war goals hold northern and southern whites accountable for rebuilding their postbellum society?</p>
<p>
<b>GG:</b> Well, I think reconciliation has been exaggerated; I don’t think most people were reconciled after the Civil War.  I think there’s a difference between reconciliation and reunion, and there’s an interesting study that will be coming out soon by Caroline Janney. She’s writing a book on the memory of the war that is going to deal with these themes, and distinguishing between reunion and reconciliation is one of her points.  I think she’s exactly right. Of course reunion began at Appomattox; the two sections are put back together into the nation. But true reconciliation--the kind of reconciliation where the opposing parties would say it doesn’t really matter who was right or wrong, let’s just talk about how brave we all were together, and let’s airbrush black people out of the picture, and just have a white drama of triumph--I don’t think that ever really happened.  I think it happened in key places, sort of showcase places, but reconciliation for Union veterans was--and Grant is a perfect example of this--their version of reconciliation was: we were right, you were wrong, and now we welcome you back on those terms.  That’s not really reconciliation of the sort that’s often put forward.  I think the animosities were profound, and I don’t think they ever went away for the wartime generation.  And the mass of white veterans did not airbrush emancipation out of the picture. That doesn’t mean they held the kind of racial views we would want them to hold, but they didn’t airbrush emancipation out.  There’s a wealth of evidence that supports this point.  In the speeches at Union monument dedications--the ones at Gettysburg are the easiest ones to get to—the speakers talk about Union the most but also talk a lot about emancipation.  Emancipation was a good thing; emancipation hurt the slaveholding class, it removed this future threat to the republic, it made a better republic possible.  I don’t subscribe to the idea that there’s this great collective amnesia that swept over white people North and South in terms of which side was right and which side was wrong.  I don’t think most Confederates would have ever said that they were wrong; they weren’t happy that they lost and they weren’t happy that slavery was gone but they accepted reality.  And the United States veterans who won the war would never have said that it didn’t matter whether you fought for Union or fought for the Confederacy.  For Union veterans, they had been right and they were willing to reconcile on those terms: “You ex-Rebels were wrong and we defeated you, now you can now come back into the Union.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> During an 1889 battlefield dedication at Gettysburg, Joshua Chamberlain says “our thoughts were not then of States as States, but of the States united, ---of that union and oneness in which the People of the United States lived and moved and had their being…[T]he cause for which we fought was higher; our thought was wider…What is lost is slavery of men and supremacy of States.” Was the Union the ultimate contribution of the wartime generation to the future of the United States?</p>
<p>
<b>GG:</b> I think the wartime generation would have absolutely said yes, and they would have said that it was an improved Union because it no longer had slavery in it and therefore did not have a powerful oligarchic class of slaveholders.  I absolutely think they would have said that the primary outcome of this war was Union.  Emancipation is also extremely important, they would have said, for those reasons, because it helps the Union.  It makes the Union stronger; it protects the Union going forward. I think that Chamberlain gets at that.  Chamberlain certainly mentions emancipation, and he would have been much closer than most Union soldiers to the position that we, in the twenty first century, would want the Union soldiers to have regarding emancipation.  But it is about the Union; you have to save the Union first. To repeat myself, they would have also said it’s a better Union.  War made a better Union.  It’s a better Union because that ticking time bomb of slavery has been excised.  So, for most of the loyal citizenry, they had taken care of all of the business at the end of the war.  They had saved the Union, and with the Thirteenth Amendment they had gotten rid of slavery.  The only reason they went beyond those things was because in the war’s immediate aftermath former Confederates did not seem to understand they had been defeated. I don’t think there’s any great lost moment in Reconstruction, I absolutely do not.  The Fourteenth Amendment was, in the mid-nineteenth-century perspective, mainly designed to punish slaveholders again; that’s what loyal citizens would have said.  Even the Fifteenth Amendment represented a way to punish the former slaveholding oligarchs.  The only reason we got to those two amendments was because the white South behaved so badly, with a big assist from Andrew Johnson, in the wake of Appomattox.  I think that many of the loyal citizens said: wait a minute; they’re not acting like they lost the war.  They’re acting like they didn’t lose the war!  They were offended by that, and so they went beyond the Thirteenth Amendment.</p>

<i><b><p> Civil War Book Review (CWBR): </i></b> Today the Civil War Book Review is proud to speak with Stephen Kantrowitz, Professor of History and Director of Graduate Studies at the University of Wisconsin. We will be discussing his recent book <i>More than Freedom: Fighting for Black Citizenship in a White Republic 1829-1889.</i> Thank you for joining us today.</p>
<p> 

<b>Stephen Kantrowitz (SK):</b> I am really happy to be with you.</p>

<i><b><p> CWBR: </i></b> Based off the title of your book, could you explain why you chose the dates that you did since most people see your subject as something intimately connected with the war years?</p>
<p>
<b>SK:</b> Yeah, the reason behind the wider parameters there is that the black freedom struggle in the nineteenth century is closely, intimately related to the Civil War era. Its normal dates and topics and events, but it isn't totally identical to it. The black freedom struggle that I'm charting begins with the publication of David Walker's <i>Appeal to the Colored Citizen's</i> in 1829-1830. Which from my perspective establishes the idea that African-Americans are going to forcefully claim a place in the American nation. But not only that, it is possible for them to do so by making an alliance with whites and being their friends. I don't say that in a casual way, Walker truly believes that it is possible for whites and blacks to share a country. That will mean changing the hearts of white people. It is that project, as much as the project as ending slavery, as much as the project of transforming the legal, or constitutional status of African-Americans that he and his comrades are after during that entire period.  To 1889, is a little less clear as a date. The reason I chose that date has a lot to do with the life of a person who is central to the arch of the book, which is Lewis Hayden, who was a fugitive slave who becomes one of the key activists in the black Boston community of the nineteenth century.   He dies in 1889.  That is the year before the lodge elections bill fails, that is the year before the Mississippi disenfranchising constitution passes, it really is the end of an era that something like David Walker and his friends would have imagined as possible earlier in the century. </p>

<i><b><p> CWBR: </i></b>  You chose Boston as the focus of your work. Why did you choose this city over others with large free African American populations like New York or Philadelphia?</p>
<p>
<b>SK:</b> Two reasons for that, first it is personal. I am from suburban Boston, I am from Brookline, and in the course of exploring the history of the free black communities in the North, I realized that I felt a very powerful personal connection to the place, and found the strangeness and difference of the history that I was exploring relative to my own experience of the place, really a powerful motivator that kept me going and connected to the project in many ways over the course of a decade. I think there is a much more important intellectual reason for doing this project and that is free black people are the freest and most equal in Massachusetts. There freer and more equal in Massachusetts than any other polity or context in North America, or at least in the United States. Black men have the right to vote, and have few formal restrictions on their lives. Therefore we get to see the limits of the possible. We also get to see a place where slavery has been extinguished since the 1780s, and so there is a long, long history of freedom. We also have a white climate that is more open to anti-slavery abolitionist ideas comparatively early. So, Boston is a great place to test the limits of the possible. It is a great place to see how far things could go, and it is wonderful for that reason too because it is in Boston that the first important interracial coalitions devoted to anti-slavery and equality emerge in the form of New England anti-slavery society and the Liberator and that world. This makes Boston a wonderful place to see how far it was possible to imagine how things would go.</p> 
<p>
<i><b><p >CWBR: </i></b> African Americans in Boston identified themselves as ""colored citizens,"" how important was this term to the fight for citizenship?</p>
<p>
<b>SK:</b> It is a surprisingly important term, and one that kept coming up over the course of the research. Not because I think everybody in that world had read David Walker, it is not clear to me that they had. The term itself survives and establishes a foothold in people's imaginations and it does so, as something to aspire to. That is people say, we the ""colored citizen's"" assemble to do this or that, and you will find that language throughout the anti-slavery press, you'll find it in petitions, you'll find it throughout the Civil War and beyond. People use it to express their hope that they can be both ""colored"" and citizens. African Americans also use this term ironically, they use it to suggest that many people think this term is an oxymoron in fact, and that we are incapable of being citizens because we are ""colored."" African Americans understand that use a lot of other terms that signal the same things. Like, ""Aliened-Americans,"" or the term ""2/3 free,"" that is one of David Walker's phrases, or the ""nominally free."" There are a lot of other phrases like these that play upon this idea of skepticism. ""Colored Citizens"" is really critical, and at one point, was actually the title of the book.</p>

<i><b><p >CWBR: </i></b>Was the rhetoric and legacy of the American Revolution important to helping African Americans see a path to citizenship? Is following this ""American"" pattern helping African Americans to gain citizenship?<p>
<p>
<b>SK:</b>Well to some degree. But I would phrase it a little differently.  I would say African Americans are they themselves aware that they had participated in the Revolution. So say, George Middleton, a Revolutionary War veteran, is one of the stalwarts of the community in the early nineteenth century on Beacon Hill. There are a large number of memories of the so called ""bucks"" of America, a black unit that was presented a flag by John Hancock. So, what I am suggesting is that the relationship to the Revolution is not one of the Revolution happened, we can use this event and therefore analogize our freedom struggle to the American Revolution's freedom struggle. Instead, we are going to seize that freedom struggle as though it were our own which it only was in part of course. The best example of this is the way that slavery comes to an end in Massachusetts. Which is, well there are many slaves in Massachusetts in the 1780s. However, in the middle of the decade, a series of court cases brought by Massachusetts slaves in which they sue for their freedom based upon the first line of the Massachusetts constitution. Which is ""All men are born free and equal."" On the basis of that simple utterance, they say how can slavery exist when all men are born free? The courts agree, and the Supreme Court agrees that slavery is unenforceable. Slavery collapses. So, the Revolution offers some of the tool kit for establishing freedom, but it is black people seizing that opportunity and leveraging those universal principles into something that will work for them in their own lives. That is the importance of the American Revolution for them. You can see this in the way that William Cooper Nell approaches the Revolution when he writes <i>Colored Patriots of the American Revolution</i> in 1855. He is very carefully deploying a partial record of black military service and other achievements, to make a case that African Americans had always been integral to the American national project. Now, he leaves out the fact that many African Americans took up the British offer to serve with them in exchange for freedom. This had been the case in every war where they had been an opportunity to serve one side or another for freedom. So, he writes a very selective account in order to make the case, because, well, he is a propagandist as well as a historian. So, it is a complex relationship, but the Revolution is absolutely useful too and important too to the black freedom struggle in the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>
<i><b><p >CWBR: </i></b>How important was the relationship between black activists and white supporters, why was this relationship needed in order to move citizenship forward?</p>
<p>
<b>SK:</b>So, we think about the United States in 1850 or 1860, there are about 250,000 free black Northerners, there are somewhere around 20 million white Northerners.  There is no way that 250,000 people even if they were all enfranchised, even if they were all activists, which of course they are not. There is no way that this tiny group of people can assert itself politically and transform a white republic, into a non-racial republic. What they can do is recruit white allies. That is the reason that 1829 is such an important date.  It is the first time we hear free blacks appeal to whites In David Walker's appeal when he says, ""What a happy country this will be if the whites will listen."" William Lloyd Garrison and a handful of others do appear to listen to that, and their willingness to extend themselves over the color line at great social cost, and enormous lifetime that many of these individuals make to that struggle. That ability to do that and show that this is a cause worth doing is the turning point for African American participation and belonging in the American body politic, and American social life, and American cultural and political life. So, I think it is absolutely critical and tough, it is not easy, and as with any struggles white people at any moment can decide to go home, and retreat to a world of comfort. That doesn't involve constant struggle, and their black counterparts do not have this option, and so there is an inequality built into the struggle itself. On the other hand, some of the white people last in the struggle for decades, and some last for their entire lives. The book charts some of the ways in which some of the white allies disappoint and desert and betray their black coalition partners. On the other hand, it shows people who had been bitter enemies like Benjamin Butler, turn out to be for critical moments really important allies. So, it's a mixed bag, but it is a really important story because it is what makes that change possible for a specific group of people. </p>
<p>
<i><b><p >CWBR: </i></b> Why was the formation of organizations, public and private, from Masons to militias, so central to your book?</p>
<p>
<b>SK:</b> There are central to the story of this because, for the most part, I said that black men were enfranchised in Massachusetts, but they are excluded from virtually every white dominated institution, organization, political party, and political club. So, in order to learn the function as political beings, to learn how institutions work, to learn how constitutions are written, to learn how meetings are run, to learn all the basic elements of political life African Americans have to turn to one another to do it. And it is through these organizations that they do these things, in much the same way that Europeans had turned to one another in the eighteenth century in the middle of the ""Enlightenment"" and begun to constitute themselves as independent societies, which were not under the control of the state or the church. It is a much the same story as that, except in the American context it is not threatening to a king or church and thus they can do. If they try to do it in Richmond or Charleston, or in New Orleans, it would have been construed as a precursor to a slave revolt. In this context they can do it and they learn to do. The second reason is less practical and more transcendent, that is they are mostly poor people. These are mostly people who experience a lot of hostility and neglect in their daily lives, as members of a very small stigmatized minority. So, to have a place to go where they constitute themselves as whole, special, important that is really important to them and their understanding of themselves and one another, and their ability to turn to the wider world with a sense of they are worthy of the things they imagine. This takes place in churches, it takes place in schools, it takes place in masonic and other kinds of fraternal organizations. Wherever it takes place I think it is part of a dialectic, a necessary back and forth between the retreat to a place of security and comfort and the knowledge that one needs to move out from that world into the world where you might make some transformative change. </p>

<i><b><p >CWBR: </i></b> How does the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act change how African Americans work to preserve their freedom?</p>
<p>
<b>SK:</b> Well the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 upends their politics. There had been efforts to capture fugitives, and rescue fugitives prior to that; examples include the Lattimore war in the 1840s. But at the same time they had not had the concerted weight of the federal government pursuing a pro-slavery political project in this way. The Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 signals to African Americans that the Federal Government has abandoned whatever ambivalence had characterized it at some point. And instead has decided to become active agents for slaveholders, and that is really threatening. It warns a fair number of far-sighted African American intellectuals that the Dred Scott decision is coming. Martin Delany as early as 1854, remarks, ""forget these personal liberty laws, our fate is in the hands of the federal government, that is where the fate of our liberties will be decided."" That turns out to be true. So, it is hard to overstate the importance of the Fugitive Slave law, it causes some people to flee, it forces others to become more militant. It ignites the political crisis of the 1850s, and it accelerates the spiral from Kansas/Nebraska, to Bleeding Kansas, to John Brown, to the beginning of the war itself. </p>
<p>
<i><b><p >CWBR: </i></b> Speaking of militant, when the war finally does come we have this popular picture of free African Americans pushing to join the army, and help fight for freedom. However, is that the case 100%, in at least the North or in Boston. What issues did the free African American community of Boston have with joining the army, based on what their idea of citizenship was? 
</p>
<b>SK:</b> So, when recruitment begins for the 54th and later the 55th and the 5th cavalry, black Bostonians bring to that effort their own history with military recruitment. For them, the last ten years have been crucial because for ten years black Bostonians have been trying to establish a black unit of the state militia, with black officers accredited and admitted and enrolled in the militia in the same way as any other unit. That is, enrolled on the terms of perfect equality with other units. That fits with their whole idea that engagement as citizens of the American nation requires a transformation of the American nation so that it abandons its commitment to whiteness. For example, they are not only asking to be chartered as a unit of the state militia they want the want the state to remove the word white from its state militia law. That is a key feature here, which the state won't do, because that is part of federal law.  So, they run up against this over and over again, and in frustration their militia movement collapses and they never march and it is a kind of a fiasco. It is not a fiasco though at the end of the day, because what it does is it sets the table for the conversation at the end of the day that happens in 1863, and that conversation says: it is great that the Union has decided to honor our desire to serve against the slaveholders, but it has to be on terms of equality. Initially they think they are going to be offered the same pay as white soldiers, they are promised that in the recruiting for the 54th. People like Robert Morrison and John DeGrasse go to the governor and say: we need to have black officers appointed. Governor Andrew approaches the War Department, and is told in no uncertain terms this will not happen. Faced with a situation where they are not going to treated as equals, where they can't have black officers, black units will be led by white officers, Morrison and his friends say nope we are not going. The proof is in the pudding here, the commitment of black Bostonians is not universal but it is strong enough when the 54th marches through Boston on its way to South Carolina in the spring of 1863, there is nearly 1000 men marching through the streets but only about 40 of them declare Boston as their hometown. Compare that to the initial movement to form a home guard to defend Massachusetts at the moment of secession in 1861.  In one night they get 125 men to sign up, here they had weeks, and weeks to recruit and they only had about 40. That tells the story, as for equality a lot of people simply aren't willing to serve, and when it turns out they are going to be paid as military laborers, and not private soldiers, many of them think twice about what they have done. Some of them have to be sent home, they strike for pay. When the state of Massachusetts offers to make up the difference in pay they say that won't do. The Federal Government has to recognize our equal service with equal pay, if we take extra pay from Massachusetts it makes it look like the money is the point, of course the money is not the point, the principle is the point. By 1864, Congress ends up passing the Equalization Act, ultimately pay is pretty much equalized for everybody. They do win that fight, but it really is a painful struggle though. </p>
<p>
<i><b><p >CWBR: </i></b> When the war ends slavery ends, now the struggle for citizenship though has really just begun. What did the activists in Boston hope to accomplish in a world without slavery, and how well were they able to reach out to their newly free southern brethren and help and tie together with them this push for Citizenship? </p>
<p>
<b>SK:</b> This is where the great disappointment of their story begins. Neither the effort to build on their wartime victory, and on the early constitutional amendments, or the outreach to the newly free people bears the kind of fruit that they thought it would. The 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments are transcendentally important.  They understand how important these things are to ending slavery, and national path to citizenship, and there cannot be racial discrimination in obtaining the franchise. Few things can be as important as these, they also see the limits of them.  Some of the people in this world oppose the ratification of the 14th Amendment because it doesn't go far enough. It does allow southern states to continue discrimination against the right to vote, if they are willing to pay the penalty of a proportional reduction of representation in Congress. That seems like a total betrayal to people like Edwin Garrison Walker. The 15th Amendment likewise, a lot of these folks believed that should have included women too. Many black activists in the Boston community, men and women, are some of the best women's rights advocates in the United States. They are very disappointed to see the 15th Amendment go forward, for not speaking about sex as well as race. They are also disappointed that the right to vote might not be limited on the basis of race, as opposed to an affirmative right to vote. What happens quickly thereafter, black Northerners find themselves marginalized and treated as second class citizens, in much the same way as black Southerners are experiencing. They are described as mob like and incapable, as really not quite ready for the full exercises and privileges of citizenship. When it comes to the freed people, I think black Northerners because of the power of their vision and the power of their literacy, because of their institutions initially feel as though they are going to shape freedom. They are going to teach the free people how to live as citizens rather than slaves. But the free people have ideas of their own. They have not grown up in an institutional framework ,have not grown up under constitutions, they live in a different cultural and political world. So, it is very difficult for, say, ministers who have been trained in the North, or for that matter Masonic organizers, to use the same tools that they used in the North to build political or cultural institutions in the South. Although they often rise to prominence in southern Reconstruction politics, they don't build the same world that they had lived in in the North. It is just not possible, in terms of life, in terms of labor.  The violence of the labor struggle in the South are just too different from what they know. It is a story of surprises and disappointments. </p>

<p><b><i>Civil War Book Review (CWBR)</i></b>: The Civil War Book Review is pleased to speak with T.J. Stiles, winner of multiple awards for biography and author of <i>Jesse James: Last Rebel of the Civil War</i> and <i>The First Tycoon: The Epic Life of Cornelius Vanderbilt</i>. Today we get to discuss his most recent work <i>Custer's Trials: A Life on the Frontier of a New America</i>. Mr. Stiles, thank you for joining us today.</p>

<p><b>T.J. Stiles</b>: Thanks very much for interviewing me.</p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: You've worked on subjects from varied backgrounds and who played remarkably different roles in American history. What drew you to George Armstrong Custer, who dies in a remote area at a young age, and is today remembered mostly for how he died?</p>

<p><b>Stiles</b>: Well, I approach my subjects from the perspective of a historian. I'm interested in the period and the questions and then that leads me to an interesting individual who I can really explore as a writer as well. And so, Custer is someone who's ubiquitous in any exploration of the Civil War Era. He just keeps showing up everywhere. And so I was very aware of his life. And as I began to think how to explore this revolutionary period of the Civil War and Reconstruction, and all of the attendant issues that come up with that period in a new way, I wanted to think ""What have I not done? What are stories and aspects of this history that are interesting to me?"" And I thought about the western experience and I thought about the conventional Civil War in the East and I thought about the other aspects--literary, cultural--of this period that I have not touched on in my first two books. Custer first drew because of the travelogue of his life. His travels across that astonishing nineteenth-century landscape. Traveling from New York to the Great Plains, to dealing with pre-industrial nomadic peoples, to visiting Wall Street and having business there. It is just an amazing journey across that panorama. And then, as I began to look into what he was doing, then it really came together for me as a book and what my particular take would be.</p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: Custer's Trials is ostensibly about the life and times of Custer, but as you have alluded to here, the book works equally well as a story about the birth of a modern United States. When did you realize that Custer's life embodied this change and how did that realization shape your approach to writing about Custer and his contemporaries? </p>

<p><b>Stiles</b>: Well there are several things that began to put together a picture of Custer as a figure on a frontier in time, as I put it in the book. We think of him as a figure on the geographical frontier, which part of his life definitely embodied that. But also, I eventually came to the conclusion that he was--what really defined his life, more than a geographical frontier--was this chronological frontier. And one little nugget of that came from his serialized memoir, which he wrote for a major magazine and which was published as a book, about his first years in the West after the Civil War. And he described his march to the Battle of the Washita, through a howling blizzard, how he was leading the column through the snow with only a compass to guide. And he wrote that, he could see the width of Broadway. He meant Broadway in New York. He didn't bother to identify it as the great street of New York. He assumed his audience would know. And that identification with the cosmopolitan center, that allusion to an urban metropolitan landmark, in a story about the wilderness of the Great Plains--about the Indian Wars--that was fascinating to me. That was something that just stuck in my mind from years ago when I first read that. And then as I began to look into his life, and I began to look into the way he had a very diverse range of actives outside of service in the Army, and even his service within the Army, showed him struggling with excited by, and sometimes rejecting all the many changes taking place in America at the time. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: Even before the Civil War ended, while praise for Custer was growing there was a growing contrast between him and Grant. Does this contrast reflect the thesis of your book, which places Custer on this frontier in time? </p> 

<p><b>Stiles</b>: I think the relationship between Custer and Grant is absolutely central to the book. One of the interesting things about Custer is that he had this very large and flamboyant, colorful, public life and yet because of the volume of material that has been preserved--the number of letters he wrote, the way in which his wife wrote about their intimate life together---we have a very interior portrait of Custer and this is actually the most interior biography I've been able to write so far. In his relationship with Grant, you see both the external and the interior aspects of Custer, highlighted by the contrast with Grant. And the growing tension between Custer and the times is reflected in and exacerbated by his growing tension with Grant. Grant was equally American with Custer in many ways. They were both from Ohio, they both were from struggling families, they had very obscure backgrounds, and yet, Grant was understated. He was someone who despised flamboyance and the big show. He was extremely practical--someone who was very modest and direct in his methods and his manner. Custer, of course, was the flamboyant figure, very consciously adopting an almost southern air of the cavalier. And that was significant. That isn't just something he should be scorned for. And yet, it is something that is a little bit out of step with an America that was more organizational, industrial, and corporate, and one that that was more technical as opposed to heroic and individualist in the way that Jacksonian America had been. And this then throughout the course of his relationship with Grant, this difference in style, in leadership, difference in style in their public image, the difference in their interest to having a public image, which did not appeal to Grant as much as it did to Custer obviously. That becomes caught up with the way they address the times. Grant is somebody who came to embrace not only emancipation, but civil rights. Whereas Custer increasingly made himself into a public figure opposing civil rights, opposing black suffrage, opposing the fourteenth amendment. There is a rise and fall in their how much they confronted each other personally, but it really came to a head right before the 1876 Little Bighorn Campaign. </p>  
<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: Grant is an interesting figure because he is our segue into other figures in Custer's life that you dwell on in the book. Custer is obviously influenced tremendously by the people closest to him or the people above him in terms of the military institution. So can you describe the dynamic between Custer, his wife Libbie, and Eliza Brown, the African American teenager he hired during the Civil War? </p>

<p><b>Stiles</b>: Yeah, this is something that is both fascinating in terms of simply the human narrative but also the way in which Custer came to confront, in a very personal way, the larger issues of the Civil War. Custer was someone who had a professional military education, even though he famously graduated last in his class at West Point in 1861, though first in demerits. He graduated--and many cadets did not make it all the way through. He had a professional military education, probably the best in the world at that point. And yet he rose in the Civil War through personal connections, through patronage, the traditional method of advancing in the world, and he combined ability and real merit with this working the chains of patronage. So 1863, on the eve of the battle of Gettysburg, his personal connections with General Alfred Pleasonton lifted him to the rank of Brigadier General, gave him command of the Michigan Brigade of Cavalry, he demonstrate his ability at the Battle of Gettysburg, particularly the third day, when he not only famously led charges, but he also deployed his men well and making use of their Spencer rifles and the new technology that the Union is bringing to the War. Now this great moment, this transformation in Custer's life, when he became a Brigadier General of the US volunteers, this led him to want to adopt the lifestyle of a general and the lifestyle he'd seen Pleasonton lead. So he went to a contraband camp in Virginia at the close of the Gettysburg campaign and he—a contraband camp of course as I know your listeners know was a camp for escaped slaves--and he found this young teenage from the piedmont region of Virginia, who was really extraordinary. She obviously had a real presence, as we know not only from Custer's response to her, but from what his wife Libbie later wrote. And she went to work for him as his cook, she took advantage of that position to really build authority and security for herself, such as she had never known. She took all of the skills of dealing with white people from a position of total powerlessness and she applied those in the role of the general's cook, and she really became his domestic manager. She traded information with visitors, couriers and messengers from other commands. She served as the banker, an interceder for Custer's men, she began to build her own patronage network by distributing food out of the general's mess. So she is someone who really took advantage of that position, built up the security for herself and then had a very interesting change in her life when February 1864 Custer then married Elizabeth Bacon, or Libbie as she was known. A very well education, very intelligent, supremely charming young woman, who came to the front and found that another woman was running the household, a young black woman. Now this was long before the Great Migration, there are very few black people in the North, and Libbie doesn't know how to navigate that relationship. She expects to have the domestic authority as the wife, and especially as the wife of a general. And yet she finds herself consistently outmaneuvered by this young black woman. So there is a personal tension as well as mutual admiration and respect between the two women, but also of course, Libbie and George Armstrong Custer, find the issues of race and slavery personified in this extremely intelligent and capable and resourceful black woman, and she actually tries to educate the Custers in slavery. She brings them, later after the Civil War, they go to Louisiana and to Texas. She brings them into slave quarters, she introduces them to people who have been whipped, and shows the scars on their backs and really helps to change Custer's views because he had quite frankly accepted slavery and opposed Lincoln's election in 1860. And yet this personal relationship, more than anything else, bring him around on the issues of emancipation, and that relationship between the three of them went on for six years until 1869. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: Eliza Brown, as a researcher, how difficult was it and what sort of methods did you use to reconstruct her life, to put it back together because it seems that a lot of the material you were able to draw on had to come from Custer or his wife, so how did get to an authentic version of Eliza Brown? </p>

<p><b>Stiles</b>: This is a very interesting question. This is something I dealt with, for example in my first book Jesse James, for whom but not only for Jesse James but the lives of the slaves in his family and his family members was not well documented in letters and diaries and traditional sources. So it is a matter of correlation and interpretation and putting together small bits of information until it builds a convincing picture. In the case of Eliza Brown, we also have the benefit of the many amateur researchers who looked into Custer's life. He's one of those figures who has attracted a great deal non-scholarly research and as my late mentor Richard Maxwell Brown said: ""These are grassroots historians.” They should not be scorned. They don't operate within the academic structure, they are not interested in issues of historiography, they can get very focused on the trees rather than the forest and yet a lot of them do great work. And so, there has been research on Eliza Brown--the farm she came from, who her slaveholders were, where she ended up after she left the Custers. I was able to draw on those bits of information. Put together with what historians have written, I think Brenda Stevenson is the author of <i>Life in Black and White: A Look at Slave Life in Northern Virginia</i> (<i>Life in Black and White: Family and Community in the Slave South</i>) and tries to understand what daily life was life, what the relationships were like, what the struggles were like for the enslaved, in exactly the part of the country where Eliza Brown came from. So it's drawing on the historiography, putting it together with bits of data, and then getting into the more qualitative look at her life, much of which comes through not only mentions in Custer's accounts, in his letters, and letters from Libbie Custer, but also Libbie's memoirs is a very important source. Memoirs need to be treated with a grain of salt of course, more than a grain of salt. What's fascinating about Libbie Custer's memoirs is that if you read it carefully with an attention to who Eliza Brown and her position in the world, you can read it very differently than has been read in the past. Libbie Custer reflected in her memoirs this tension, as well as the mutual respect and support, that the two of them had. There's many moments throughout their memoirs which she highlights moments where she embarrassed Eliza Brown, when she sort of showed her up, her racism is quite frank. We understand the tension between the two women because Libbie Custer wrote about it. It's there in her own account and so that is convincing to me because I don't think it is particularly flattering to Libbie Custer. Sometimes you take the same bit of information and if you think about that information from the perspective of the person who is has traditionally not been in power to tell the story it looks very different.</p> 
<p>So to take one example, when Custer was deployed to Louisiana immediately after the Grand Review of the armies and he took Eliza Brown, took Libbie, they stopped briefly in Michigan, and Libbie's hometown Monroe, then they traveled through Ohio to their way to New Orleans, they stopped at a restaurant that had no separate facilities for black customers. And so, the owner refused to serve Eliza Brown at all and Custer insisted that she be fed. And so he insisted, in a great confrontation with the owner, that she be seated with Custer and his staff. And Libbie, and it was a very tense moment, as we know from Libbie’s memoir, and this has been traditionally has been seen as a great thing. Custer was insisting that his servant should be showed respect and served also. But for one thing it is the lack of segregated facilities that upset Custer. The fact that there were no facilities where her to be fed. He wasn't trying to desegregate the dining halls of Ohio; he was asserting his position in the world as a major general at that point of the US Volunteers. And he wasn't going to let some civilian say that his servant couldn't eat. And for Eliza Brown, that moment is fraught with tension; she did not ask for that confrontation. She is aware of the dangers of confrontations over race; and she knows that if anyone is going to suffer from that confrontation, it will be her. This is my interpretation brought in by imaginatively understanding--based on our knowledge of race relations of the Civil War and its immediate aftermath--what life was like for a black person who is powerless in that situation. Libbie wrote that she was embarrassed, and I write about that in the page, but I say from Eliza Brown's perspective it’s not embarrassment-- its fear, its danger, and a sense of powerlessness that's going to be in play. Now that's interpretation, that's not fact. And yet, highlighting this moment, drawing it out, putting my interpretations on the page, draws attention to it and I hope gets the reader to think about these moments from the perspective from somebody whose normally been left in the margins, or left out of the picture entirely.</p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: What was it about the West as a context--because you talk a lot about context and how much it matters for these historical actors--what was so different about the American West versus Custer's lived experiences before the war and during the war?</p>

<p><b>Stiles</b>: That's an interesting question because it brings out Custer's personal flaws and conundrums as well as the, as you put it, the contextual differences. Custer was someone who I think was driven by a great ambition; he desired greatness and he desired to be seen as great; and, coming from a very obscure background, he had an underside, I detect, an underside of insecurity, which gave him great volatility. He rose to high rank in the U.S. Volunteers at a very age without much of an apprenticeship in lower levels of command; he was from a staff position to a command position very early in his life; and, so he didn't have the seasoning, the experience and the slow process of maturation within an organization, within in a command. The Civil War though was a great crisis and we see in the Civil War that--and actually in later moments in the West also--that in combat is the one moment when we don't see signs of insecurity, we don't see the volatility that marked other areas of his personal life. He was at ease; he was himself; and, so combat despite the impression left by how he died, combat was his great forte. He wasn't simply lucky, even though he was; he wasn't simply heroic in leading charges, though he was; he really knew how to husband his resources, how to make use of the latest technology. He more often deployed his men in dismounted skirmish lines in the Civil War then he had them lead in mounted charges. He made great use of his rifled artillery and other resources available to him. And so, we see Custer as a true professional in the Civil War and in moments that come afterward. The problem is, the moment that combat stops, Custer now has to play a different role; he has to play a different role within the Army itself, in which his role goes from combat leadership to what can only be called management. He has learn how to deal with troops who are no longer driven by the great mission of the Civil War who are now going to be dealing quotidian complaints about food and discipline, and other issues that come up in any command. He has to develop tact; he as to develop a way of keeping his troops contented to a certain degree without simply relying his heroic image, and that's an area where he really flounders. And what happens is this is where we see the insecurity in Custer. Again and again he lashes out, very different from the way that Grant as a commander operated. Grant really knew how to win his troops loyalty without relying on harsh discipline, not that he didn't use it, but that wasn't his primary hallmark as a commander.</p> 
<p>Custer on the other hand engaged in whippings, head shavings--other humiliations--to try and force his men to knuckle under, and it only built up more resentment. Now in the different phases in the West the first came actually in this period of 1865 into very early 1866 when he was deployed into Louisiana and then Texas. At that point he was commanding U.S. volunteers who had not been mustered out; and, these are troops that wanted to go home. He was dealing with Texas which is an area that had never been significantly invaded by Union forces, it had not been conquered; slavery had gotten stronger there, and there we begin to see another aspect of Custer's post war difficulties, which is a return to his conservative viewpoint, and also his desire to be accepted by, what we can only call, his social superiors. So the planters of Texas who had done quite well during the war, they cultivate Custer and he very readily accepts their invitations and their offers to socialize with them. And we see his Jacksonian Democratic, conservative views on race and society really coming back to the fore after all of this lobbying by Eliza Brown about slavery. That's the political of this story and how it put him in conflict with the country becomes very important with his next deployment in the West in 1866 and 1867.</p>  

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: Could we also describe the difference between east and west at this time as one of---in the American West--especially in the 1870s--as a place that is simply less managed, it's one that seems in your book, at least, seems to be a place that is racially ambiguous at times, where people who are in the margins of society in the east are in power in the west, does that play into the West's ability to confound not only Custer but his contemporaries too?</p>

<p><b>Stiles</b>: Well I think that's a major issue in general in the West. We have to remember of course there are many wests. The southwest in Texas you have the slave economy of the South, which not only in Texas, but also in the so-called Five Civilized tribes of the nations that had been ejected from the southeast on the Trail of Tears, they have slavery, they sided with the Confederacy. You have that southern slaveholding culture is very strong on the southern Great Plains, and then you have other layers of the West, which are brining into a mix and conflict and alliance, a very complex mix of very different peoples in a vast landscape. So of course you have Latino-Americans--I wouldn't call them Mexican-Americans because the border crossed them--who have strongly influenced a lot of the culture in the West and especially in the southwest. You have many different Native Americans who are in conflict with each other. You have different economies that are taking place; you have of course the Sodbusters in Kansas and Nebraska, but you also have the mining economy of the mountain states, and you have the great transit that's taking place across the Great Plains, which is a major issue, and something the Army doesn’t really quite come to grips with because its driving the conflict of the High Plains nations. And then you have this hybrid hunting and trading economy that the Great Plains peoples have to varying degrees and the conflicts between the High Plains who are fully nomadic and the nations of the lower Great Plains, lower in altitude to the east, who combine horticulture with seasonal hunting, and who are in a great conflict with the High Plains nations. </p>
<p>It's a multilayered set of conflicts. You have a changing economy as the cattle drives start and you have the great cow-towns grow-up in Kansas, and you have different sources of conflict. It's not simply whites come in and try to grab the land, it's migration through the West is creating economic degradation which is making the bison based economy of the High Plains untenable, so the Army keeps trying to assert the right of passage and the Great Plains people are stating quite frankly that's making their lives untenable and the Army doesn't really quite accept it--or to the degree that they understand it--they say you just have to live with it. So there are all of these different tensions that are taking place and Custer steps into this very complex landscape at a moment of personal crisis. I mean 1866 and 1867, when Custer is deployed to Ft. Riley, now his regular Army rank is that of Lieutenant Colonel, he is effectively the field commander of the new 7th cavalry, and yet he was in personal crisis because he had thrown him into Andrew Johnson's campaign again the Republicans and the 14th amendment. He went alongside Grant on the Swing Around the Circle, but where Grant was disgusted by Johnson's politics, and actually left the campaign early, Custer spoke to the crowds alongside Johnson on the stump and helped organize a soldier's convention to support Andrew Johnson, to oppose the 14th amendment, the Republicans; he very much himself a conservative national political figure. And as a result, he was scorned by a majority of--at least politically speaking--by a majority of people in the North. And he went from being a great hero to being a---someone who was intensely controversial. </p> 
<p>This is before he starts confronting the Indian Wars and so that important; he's under pressure, he's under crisis. And his constant neediness, this personal neediness of his, for attention and approval and for sex, quite frankly, put him in crisis in his marriage. He had spent time in New York in 1866, away from his wife, he was flirting, he was pursuing other women. And I believe, from reading the bits of evidence that we have, that he had as a result created a crisis in his marriage. So Custer confronts this very complex picture of the conflict  with the High Plains nations at a moment when he is personally preoccupied, and it's a very different kind of warfare, and of course that's something historians have stressed, that the warfare on the Great Plains, it’s not properly guerilla warfare--it’s a raiding warfare, something that Alexander the Great had to deal with in Afghanistan, something that settled populations have dealt with on their borders, on their frontiers of nomadic people from time immemorial. And it's a very difficult kind of warfare for a conventional force to manage, and Custer is trying to carry out orders that are not necessarily well thought out, he's put in an impossible position at a time when he is least able to grapple with it personally. As a result, he completely falls apart—in 1867 he was court marshalled, quite rightly, and convicted quite rightly, and again it reflects this amazing confluence of personal disaster, of political crisis in the nation, and of these great crises that are taking place on the Great Plains as a result of the U.S.'s expansion into this space that has been dominated by other peoples for so long. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: What were the expectations of plains Indians? Well the high plains Indians especially, who were used to military conquest--their expectation was to win militarily and not necessarily acquiesce to the United States offers of land and settlement? </p>

<p><b>Stiles</b>: This is something we have to remember is that the United States had been a presence in the West, the trans-Mississippi West since the time of Lewis and Clark, and the U.S. had a sort of contractual relationship, a relationship of alliance and partnership, rather than domination. So, for example, the Lakotas in the northern plains they had actually, at various points, been allies with the United States as the U.S. dealt with other nations. They had been enemies and allies, they had confronted I don't deal with much in the book, but extremely important, is the war on the northern plains that resulted from the so called Sioux uprising in Minnesota during the Civil War. General Alfred Sully led a column, including a number confederate prisoners of war who were given the option of serving in the U.S. Amy in the West--What's the term? galvanized Confederates who'd been converted into Union soldier--and led this destructive column through the West; and, yet what happened after that campaign is that it was followed by Red Cloud's War where there were some fights including the famous the so-called Fetterman Massacre, and there were some Army victories, some Indian victories, and the U.S. government decided to ratify this Sioux on the northern plains. So rather than a story of constant displacement and constant defeat--you know we tend think of the U.S. of advancing west and defeating and displacing various Indian nations--a kind of march of defeat for the Indian nations--the Sioux had seen ups and downs, they'd seen victories and defeats followed by the Fort Laramie Treaty, which basically ratified their power on the northern plains. It granted them this huge reservation and then a larger area that was called ""unseated Sioux territory,"" which included a big disputed zone in their wars with Crows and others to the West. And then they accepted these treaty goods and treaty rations that were given to them, that the U.S. saw as a show of the U.S.'s superior position, that they were ceding to U.S. authority and they have these agency posts in their territory and they come in and accept these rations. Whereas I think the Sioux were seeing this as a part of their ongoing contractual relationship with the U.S. If anything it was more resembling the tribute that they forced some of their militarily weaker neighbors over time. They certainly didn't see themselves as a defeated and subordinate people. And so this is very different from the High Plains people, of the central plains, who were confronting US power and suffering defeats much more directly. </p> 
<p>What leads to the great Sioux War of 1876 and '77, is not necessarily a sense of grievance by the Sioux they were upset by many things, particularly the invasion of miners into the Black Hills, but the fact that they had a sense of power--1873, for example, was climax of their generations long war with the Pawnees. They wiped out the last major Pawnee buffalo hunting party on the Great Plains. So they are embroiled in a series of wars, which they are winning at the time when they face the great confrontation with the U.S.; and that's very important to remember, that they were not feeling weak, they were feeling strong when Custer advanced to his death. </p>

<p><b><i>Civil War Book Review </i>(<i>CWBR</i>):</b>Today, I’m discussing with Professor William J. Cooper, Jr., his newly-published <i>We Have the War Upon Us: The Onset of the Civil War, December 1860-April 1861</i>.  Professor Cooper, thank you for joining us today.<p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR</i>:</b> You examine the failure of the Democratic National Convention when it met in Charleston as a signal of the splintering of the Democratic Party.  Surely the Democrats understood what their failure meant nationally; why couldn’t northern and southern Democrats compromise to oppose the Republicans who faced a much easier task in an election against a broken Democratic Party?</p>
<p>
<p><b>William J. Cooper, Jr. (WJC):</b> Well the Democratic Party had two problems.  The first problem was Stephen A. Douglas who was an anathema to the southerners, and the southerners were determined to stop him.  They thought they had a good chance to do so because of the two-thirds rule requiring two-thirds of the delegates to nominate a candidate.  Moreover, the more moderate southern leaders like Jefferson Davis, for example, wanted the convention to move toward nominations before a platform. They wanted to get a candidate in place and then get a platform, but the more radical southerners wanted a platform first because they wanted to force Douglas to come towards them or to beat Douglas at his own game.  And those people led by William Lowndes Yancey of Alabama forced through a platform regarding slavery in the territories that the Douglas people could not and would not accept.  Though the platform committee voted for that platform, or that plank, because the vote was by states.  Once the radical southerners pressed the others on the platform committee went along with them.  But when it went before the full convention it was voted down, and at that point Yancey lead a walk-out.  Now most scholars don’t think Yancey wanted to break up the Democratic Party, that he wanted to come back as a kind of hero, a king maker.  Well he didn’t come back, and other southern states that walked out with him didn’t come back because they weren’t asked to do so.  The Douglas people in Charleston thought that they could get him nominated but the ruling was made by the convention chair that it took two-thirds of all the delegates, not just those remaining; thus they didn’t get what they wanted and the convention adjourned, agreeing to meet again in Baltimore.  It met and it was the same difficulty even compounded because some of the southern states sent old delegations and some sent new delegations.  The party came apart.  It came apart both on the southern antipathy to Douglas and on radical southern demands that northerners wouldn’t accept.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR</i>:</b> You mention Yancey from Alabama, but you state that “Fire-eaters considered [at one point] the Palmetto State their citadel, the stronghold where they exercised enormous influence.”  How and why did South Carolina ascend to this status instead of any of the other Deep South states?</p>
<p>
<p><b> (WJC):</b> I’ll do the best I can with that.  That’s a vexing question that numerous historians have addressed, and none have come to a conclusion that satisfies more than a handful of individuals.  Why South Carolina became so radical and stayed so radical so long is very hard to understand.  The political organization of the state which gave great power to the legislature and still required property qualifications to sit in it, the absence of a two-party system which was chiefly due to John C. Calhoun’s dominance of the state during the formative period of the Democratic and Whig Parties, the overwhelming domination of the state by large planters, the fact that the state had been majority black for so long, all of these come together.  And of course South Carolina was a nullifying state in the 1830s and wanted to secede in 1850, but even the radicals of the state decided that someone needed to go first because they had been alone once before yet they could not get anybody else to go out so secession in South Carolina came apart.  In 1860 they still wanted someone to go out first-most of them-but they couldn’t get anybody to take that step.  But when they thought they got promises that some would follow especially Georgia, the radicals in the legislature in the state succeeded in getting the state to go out.  It’s very difficult to understand because amongst the chief radicals were some of the richest people in America: the rice and Sea Island cotton planters on both sides of Charleston on the sea coast,  people who were absolutely vulnerable if any military conflict should occur.  And when that did occur one of the first places that fell to Union forces was around Beaufort, South Carolina, a radical bastion and a center of very wealthy planters.  My answer is not very satisfactory because I don’t think a satisfactory answer exists at this point.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR</i>:</b> It seems that the Radicals-we mentioned those fire-eaters in the South, but also those hard-liner Republicans in the North- that they are the ones that scooped up any potential undecided support during the secession crisis.  Why couldn’t the Border Conservatives, as you call them, garner more support for compromise and patience during the secession crisis?</p>
<p>
<p><b> (WJC):</b> The Border Conservatives failed because they failed to move the leadership of the Republican Party.  And I spend a lot of time in this book talking about the struggle of Border Conservatives.  They had an ally in the Republican Party, William Henry Seward.  I’m persuaded that Seward wanted to make a deal, that he would have made a deal had it been within his power, but Lincoln said no and Seward pushed Lincoln as far as he thought he could.  He did urge Lincoln to adopt a more conservative, more conciliatory course, even down to Fort Sumter when he wanted Lincoln to remove the federal garrison.  But he never got too far in front of Lincoln, he never wanted to alienate Lincoln.  The failure of the Border Conservatives to convince Lincoln that he needed to move toward their position guaranteed that the Republican Party would not move.  Nothing would have moved the Republican hard-liners but, if Lincoln had moved, the great center of the party would have followed him.  I am persuaded of that.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR</i>:</b> It almost feels, at times like politics got away from the political giants of the day, specifically William Seward and Jefferson Davis, who preached caution and union.  How did the people on the ground, the hard-liner Republicans and the Fire-eaters successfully achieve the plunge into secession and war?</p>
<p>
<p><b> (WJC):</b> Well let’s go to the South first.  Secession followed the election of Lincoln.  Fire-eaters had been preaching secession to break up the Union, for so long, but they advocated a doctrine that asked southerners to step into the unknown, to take a giant step away from something they knew into something that they didn’t know.  Now the fire-eaters proclaimed that this was going to be the political Garden of Eden, the land of milk and honey.  But southerners weren’t sure and southerners were loyal Americans; they embraced the United States.  They looked to the great American heroes as their own heroes.  Leaving the country, leaving the United States was not a step they would take easily but with Republicans in charge, now the fire-eaters ask: what’s going to happen with the Republican administration?  So now you’ve got the unknown of secession matched with the unknown of what a Republican would do.  What men like Jefferson Davis wanted was some signal from the Republicans that they were going to respect what a person like him thought of as southern rights.  And that meant to say that the southerners had a constitutional right, not only to own slaves in Mississippi, but a constitutional right to share in the national territory, in the national property .  Davis didn’t demand a slave code for the territories but he did demand a constitutional right.  He was quite willing-and men like him were quite willing-to make compromises on territorial alignments, but on the fundamental right he wanted Republican acquiescence or recognition.  He thought that if he had that he could go back to Mississippi and to the rest of the South and say: look, they recognize our rights.  When he couldn’t get that, the fire- eaters had him in a box; if he wanted to retain, if men like him wanted to retain, any power and prestige in their states they were forced to go in that direction.  Likewise, in the North, the hardline Republicans said: we will never make any deals, we will never make any compromise.  While their number was a minority within their party, the president- elect, the man who was to be the leader of their party, stood with them on that particular issue.  We must remember that, despite the fire-eaters in the South and the hard-liners in the North, a large pro-compromise element did exist and that group included northerners and southerners, anti-slave and pro-slave alike who sought to maintain the Union despite sectional differences. In my judgment Lincoln’s failure in this crisis was that he never said anything publicly about what he would and wouldn’t do.  He never stood up and told southerners that he would be president of all Americans, that he and they were different but also alike.  Lincoln had an enormous gift for fitting political language and one can imagine the kind of statement he would have made.  It might very well have quieted some of the southern concern but he didn’t’ do it.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR</i>:</b> On pages 72-73, you discuss a shift in Lincoln’s approach to compromise, noting that he supported the Compromise of 1850 publicly but within a decade of that support, “Lincoln unequivocally opposed compromise even as the Union came apart.”  What accounts for this adjustment in his viewpoint?</p>
<p>
<p><b> (WJC):</b> Well I think that there are two things.  This is a general position on Lincoln and compromise, but I think you have to be a little more specific and look at Lincoln at this particular instance between his election and his taking office, why he was so adamantly opposed then.  And I think that there are three reasons, and I talk about them in my book at some length.  First, he was ignorant of the South; he had no southern political friends, really no southern friends of any kind except a few in Kentucky.  He didn’t know anything about the Deep South politics; also he didn’t understand the society of the Deep South.  I don’t think he had any recognition of how deeply slavery had become embedded, how white southerners, no matter whether they thought slavery was good or bad, were committed to it.  Committed to their slave society, they wanted no interference with it.  They feared that he was going to interfere with them.  I don’t believe he stopped to think, when he said this country can’t continue half-slave and half-free, how southerners might react when he says something like that.   Second, Lincoln approached this whole problem as a Republican partisan, I think he had just become party leader.  He knew Seward, for example, had more national stature than he did even after his election, and he knew that many Republicans still looked to Seward.  He wanted to establish himself as the party leader.  He was very concerned about what he saw as the fragility of the Republican coalition, that he was the first elected Republican president and he feared that if he moved toward conciliation, toward any serious compromise, that he would alienate the hard-liners, the left wing of his party, who might bolt.  In contrast, Seward who had been a spokesman for antislavery politics for a decade, first as a Whig, then as a Republican, had a standing to face those people head-on if they came after him, and he suspected that they would. But where would they go if the most radical bolted?  He thought that the Republican Party needed to expand, and he was looking to those conservatives in the border states to build a national Republican Party based on Union.  Now, Lincoln eventually came to the Union party idea during the war, but before war he never saw the Republican Party expanding beyond its initial boundaries.  He did not come to this crisis as the president-elect of a country but as the leader of a party and a party that had always been in opposition.  But there was even a third factor.  Lincoln, I think, was more viscerally anti-slave than Seward.  Yet, he was no abolitionist; he even supported the original Thirteenth Amendment which would have made it practically impossible to touch slavery in the states.  As a constitutionalist, he couldn’t do otherwise because he believed the constitution sanctioned slavery in the states, but by emphasizing the territories and by saying never again in any territory he could get around that constitutional barricade and still hold to his constitutional scruples.  He saw the future in territories.  In his view stopping slavery in the territories stopped slavery in the future.  He also claimed that he was simply carrying out the legacy of the founding fathers.  In his famous Cooper Union address back in February 1860, he focused on the signers of the Constitution and he said that these men really intended for an antislavery America and somehow that legacy had been turned in the wrong direction.   But although Lincoln in the speech talked about what he called the facts, the founding fathers bequeathed a much more complicated legacy.  With every president from Washington to Monroe new territories permitting slavery were added to the Union or organized</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR</i>:</b> You mentioned Seward’s national recognition and leadership in the formation of the Republican Party, being one of the premier Whigs before that.  In those weeks after the election, did Seward want to appear as the savior of the Union for his own self-fulfilling purposes or did he simply not trust Lincoln to serve the country adequately?</p>
<p>
<p><b> (WJC):</b> I don’t think he knew enough about Lincoln to know what to think about Lincoln.  I think most Republicans were in that position except those who were very close to Lincoln in Illinois.  Lincoln had a fairly small circle, his circle of intimates was almost closed.  And Seward wasn’t the only Republican concerned about what Lincoln would do.  I think he did have concerns about Lincoln but I think Seward also, early on, decided that the Union was in great danger and something had to be done to pacify the South in terms of convincing southerners that the Republicans weren’t out to get them.  And that’s what he wanted to do, but as I said a few minutes back, he was never willing to cross Lincoln.  Lincoln had bested Seward for the nomination and had been elected.  You can understand Lincoln’s thinking: if I go along with Seward, it’s going to look like I’m Seward’s man, and it’s going to be Seward’s presidency rather than mine.  I’ve got to establish myself and put myself in the front.  And he did that; he certainly did that in December of 1860 when after Thurlow Weed, Seward’s political ally, went to Illinois hoping to get Lincoln’s agreement on things he and Seward wanted.  Weed failed.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR</i>:</b> James Buchanan has time and again faced severe criticism for his failure to prevent secession and his seemingly passive stance in the face of southern attacks on federal property.  But, I wonder, how tough was the task that he faced and might historians have judged too harshly what he did not do (hold the Deep South in the Union) while failing to commend him for halting the spread of secession and preventing open conflict?</p>
<p>
<p><b> (WJC):</b> Well I don’t think Buchanan could have done much to halt the spread of secession.  Yet, he did have a great deal to do with keeping the flag flying at Fort Sumter and Fort Pickens that gave Lincoln levers that Lincoln wouldn’t have had otherwise.  Tthere was enormous pressure on Buchanan to give up both of them, and he held his ground in both.  I think he deserves a good deal of credit in terms of maintaining a position that his successor could use if his successor chose to.  What Buchanan would have done if he had ever faced what Lincoln faced at Fort Sumter: Anderson’s saying he needed to come out, that he was running out of supplies.  I think he would have withdrawn Anderson under those circumstances because his agreement with Anderson was if Anderson asked for help he would send help, Anderson didn’t ask for help in early March of 1861.  He said he couldn’t be successfully reinforced.  In terms of stopping secession there was very little Buchanan could do.  You may say, well he should have done what Andrew Jackson did.  Well remember Andrew Jackson did two things.  One, he did raise the threat of the sword but he also worked with Congress to get a compromise to diffuse the situation.  Buchanan had no chance with Congress, the Republicans wouldn’t pay him any mind whatever.  He had even lost his influence with the southern Democrats over Fort Sumter.  So by January the first he was in Congress a dead letter practically speaking, with both Republicans and southern Democrats.  Then, he faced a much more difficult situation than Jackson did.  Jackson had one state where Buchanan had one state going out and several other states, all the way west to Texas saying we’re all going out if you do anything.  So he calculated that if he took any overt act that would encourage secession more than if he didn’t take any overt act.  Now perhaps taking an overt act would have slowed it down; we can’t know that but that was the calculation he made and in my mind to compare him and Jackson is really like comparing apples and oranges.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR</i>:</b> When Alabama Congressman, Williamson Cobb, left his post in Washington to return home, he writes the Republican Party: “you can still this storm before the sun shall set to-day.”  Is that correct, and how?</p>
<p>
<p><b> (WJC):</b> Well he said that in a speech in the House of Representatives.  If the Republicans would have agreed to a serious compromise, that would have killed secession.  I mean Cobb believed that; I certainly believe that; Jefferson Davis believed that, Robert Toombs (who didn’t want any compromise) believed that.  It’s hard to see, in a state like Georgia where the vote was so close anyway, that if serious compromise had been reached that Georgia would have gone out.  Even though South Carolina had gone out, Georgia was the bridge to the rest of the Deep South.  However, the same deal that started secession in Georgia would have done likewise farther west.  In sum, I think Cobb was right.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR</i>:</b> You end your book, just as you begin it, with a look at John J. Crittenden, the political heir-apparent to Henry Clay.  While Clay became known as the Great Compromiser or Great Pacificator, Crittenden failed to hold the nation together.  Does this signal failure on Crittenden’s part or is he symbolic of the inability to compromise after Lincoln’s election?</p>
<p>
<p><b> (WJC):</b> I think that Crittenden did all that Crittenden could do.  He could not move Lincoln; he could not move the Republicans.  The Republican Party was not going to break with Lincoln.  He was the first elected Republican.  The Republicans had never had the White House before and they were going to stand united behind that man if they could.  And even Seward, who wanted to go toward Crittenden wasn’t going to break with Lincoln.  They were going to keep a united party.  It was not Crittenden’s fault as one hard-liner Republican said and I quote him: “we couldn’t stand firm until people like Clay and Webster were gone.”  Crittenden just couldn’t move the people he had to move. </p>

<p>
<b><i>Civil War Book Review (CWBR):</i></b>   You begin your latest book with the phrase ""Jefferson Davis by William Cooper, once again,"" of course referring to your 2000 biography ""Jefferson Davis, American.""  But why Jefferson Davis in the first place, what lead you to study this man?</p>
<p>
<b><i>William J. Cooper, Jr. (WJC):</i></b>  I've been interested in Davis for a long time.  When I was a senior in college, I wrote my senior thesis on the Confederate strategy at the end of the war in the West from Atlanta to Bentonville, and of course Davis was a major character, and that and I went to graduate school and I thought about Jefferson Davis and my advisor told me that Davis was too complicated for a graduate student to write a biography about, but I could pick a portion of his life like ""Jefferson Davis, Secretary of War.""  This seemed to me to be about as dull as you could get.  So I went in a totally different direction, and I ended up writing about antebellum politics.  But Davis was interesting to me and always in my mind.  Nobody ever wrote the biography of Davis that everyone turned to.  I became a dean in the 1980s and when I finished that I was looking around and I said to myself, ""This is the time.  If you are ever going to give it a shot, give it a shot.""  And so I decided to try it.  At that time the Jefferson Davis Papers project at Rice University was made open to me-- earlier in my career they had a less than open door policy to let people come in.  And so I decided to take a shot at it.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> This collection of essays focuses sharply on Davis the politician and Davis as the commander-in-chief of the Confederate States of America.  And you characterize Davis as the ""consummate antebellum politician,"" a man who intimately understood politics as ""a means to an end,"" and he worked to achieve his goals through deliberation and compromise.  Was Davis representative of the ordinary southern politician? How did he differ from his colleagues?</p>
<p>
<b><i>WJC:</i></b>  I don't think he did differ from his successful colleagues.  I could rattle you off a half dozen more names, but Davis has generally been depicted as a person who was not a politician; a man who was the antithesis of the politician, and this depiction did not simply deal with the Confederate States of America, though it centered on his role as president.  But before that he was most often characterized in the historiography as a person who was stiff-necked, who was unbending, who as his wife said, ""didn't know the arts of a politician and wouldn't practice them if he knew them.""  And my research indicated to me that he was a very different kind of person.   I don't think he was that kind of stiff-necked, unbending man; I think he was a professional politician and he was really good at what he did.</p>  
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b>  Keeping in the vein of politics here, you say in this book, definitely, Davis played a critical role in the opposition of the Compromise of 1850, yet as you also note, this didn't mean that Davis opposed compromise, <i>per se</i>.  Why did he oppose the plan from 1850?  And what would he have preferred?</p>
<p>
<b><i>WJC:</i></b>  Well he opposed the plan for 1850 chiefly because of California.  Bringing in California as a free state would end the balance in the Senate.  There would be 16 free states rather than 15, and the slave states would remain at 15.  He saw southern power in the Senate as absolutely critical in maintaining southern power in the nation.  And he followed Calhoun.  Calhoun believed that you had to have political power to maintain your position in the United States even if your position was based on views of the constitution.  So Davis believed that California coming in would disrupt the balance and would weaken southern power.  He also objected because California was being handled a way differently from any preceding territory becoming a state.  It was done so quickly with no territorial phase, which would eliminate any possibility for Southerners to participate in its settlement.  That’s why he opposed the Compromise of 1850 so desperately. </p>
<p> 
What he preferred and what he had supported and voted for in 1848 was to extend the Missouri Compromise line.  He also voted in 1848 for the proposal that would turn the question of slavery and the territories of to the federal judiciary—the so-called Clayton proposal, which like the Missouri Compromise extension, passed the Senate, but failed in the House.  He supported both of those, because he thought those were dividing the question, giving the South a fair chance;  whereas he thought the Compromise of 1850, with California as the headlight, didn't give the South a chance and broke equality.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b>  Davis urged caution during the secession crisis and he didn't support immediate secession.  Did southerners ever question Davis's suitability for the Confederate presidency based on his support—albeit qualified—of the Union?</p>
<p>
<b><i>WJC:</i></b> Well, not really I don't think.  There may have been a few radicals who thought Davis had been too conservative, but not for most Southerners.  He was not like Alexander Stephens, who had actually opposed secession at the Georgia secession convention.  Once it became clear that Mississippi was down the road to secession, Davis said fine.  When he was in Jackson, in November 1860 at the meeting of the congressional delegation for the governor to make his decision on how to approach the legislature and the crisis, Davis opposed immediate action and he told the governor this.  But when Davis left that meeting to go to Washington, he made it very clear that what Mississippi decided was where he would go.  When he first got to Washington in December, he was very dismayed and very depressed and didn't think there was any chance that any kind of compromise, and then his spirits lifted a bit at mid-month. As he said, he didn't really give up on the Union, until the failure of the Committee of Thirteen in the Senate.  But he was not looked upon as somebody who had really opposed secession, like Alexander Stephens.  He was looked upon as a moderate, and that was terrifically important, especially to people in the Upper South states.  People in states like Virginia had informed some of those who were going out that they needed to put in a moderate man like Davis.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> Now you certainly make clear too that Davis has held firm loyalties to the Union.  Yet you also note that early on in the war Davis wanted to make, ""the enemy know firsthand that the sting of war.""  How would you describe Davis's feelings toward northerners, and toward bringing the war to them?  And then, how did Davis's outlook harden over the course of the war years?</p>
<p>
<b><i>WJC:</i></b>  In the beginning, what Davis wanted was for the Confederacy to be left alone, but he didn't really think that was going to happen.  He didn't believe the North would let the South go without a struggle, and he foresaw a very long and difficult struggle.  At the same time, I don't think Davis had any enmity toward Northerners, <i>per se</i>.  He began to have a real antipathy toward the Lincoln administration because of what he saw as a harsh war policy. Confederate territory came into Union hands in 1861 and from then on every month, every week almost, more and more fell.  What he saw was not only Union armies pushing Confederate armies back or overrunning Confederate forces, but he saw buildings burned, he saw people put on the road as refugees, he saw a war against civilians.  And then, of course, when the Union army began to employ blacks that, in the South, that raised a specter that haunted Southerners for generations—the idea of race war. He saw the Emancipation Proclamation as an utterly brutal act that endangered southern civilians, particularly women and children.  By 1862, when the South had been invaded, and he saw what he called this brutality, and what modern historians call the hard War, he wanted the North defeated.  He wanted northern civilians to know what they were perpetrating on the South, and the only reason northern civilians didn't feel it was because he didn't have the wherewithal to make them feel it.</p>
<p>
<b><i.CWBR:</i></b> You argue in this book that Davis saw the fight for the Confederacy as a ""holy mission.""  The Union had failed and so the principles of 1776 had to be secured through a “revolution against politics"" as George Rable has put it.  Did Jefferson Davis foresee an eventual return to a more traditional form of politics or would fealty to the Confederacy always amount to a ""holy mission"" even after independence had been gained?</p>
<p>
<b><i>WJC:</i></b>  I can't answer that.  His great goal was to have an independent Confederacy.  If the Confederacy had in fact won its independence, none of us knows what would have happened.  I simply can't answer that question, but he certainly believed that as long as the Confederacy was in balance that the old politics had to disappear.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b>  You argue that as the conflict progressed, political concerns dominated Davis's strategic thinking, again linking the idea of politics and war aims.  To what extent did these concerns about politics hamper the Confederate war effort?</p>
<p>
<b><i>WJC:</i></b>  I don't think that he got more concerned about the political aspects of the war as the war progressed.  I think that was in the forefront from the very beginning.  I argue that Fort Sumter was his first great political strategic act, because Fort Sumter was a political act more than a military act in my judgment.  I think if Davis never had to concern himself with politics he might have done things differently.  But in some ways I think that’s a false question, because he himself said there was no way to separate the two.  He existed in a world in which politics had to play a part.  Probably if politics wasn't involved at all, you could say well he may have jettisoned the Trans-Mississippi early on.  He did say that it was a tough job to have politics and war at the same time.  Maybe he would have concentrated more on other issues as some of his critics said he should have done, but I'm not sure.  That’s a hard question to answer.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> You mention in the book, too, though that one of the problems that Davis faced was that he felt he had to keep troops throughout the Confederacy.</p>
<p>
<b><i>WJC:</i></b>  That's right, he did.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> And he had to do that, in your opinion, to maintain the political balance?</p>
<p>
<b><i>WJC:</i></b>  He had to do that to maintain loyalty.  Davis knew there was no Confederate nationalism in 1861.  He said on one occasion that Confederate nationalism was being created in the cauldron of war.  He looked to the Revolution.  He saw American nationalism being created in the American Revolution.  So he thought it could be done—that Confederate nationalism could be created.  But it didn't exist when the war began in his own mind, nor in mine.  He looked at portions of his country and he was told by politicians and by soldiers that in places like Arkansas, for example, that if he didn't defend Arkansas that it would probably leave the Confederacy.  And if Arkansas left who might be next?  As he explained to one of his generals, he said, ""When we give up on a place we not only lose territory, we tend to lose men as well,"" because their loyalty had not yet been secured by the Confederate government in his own eyes.  And I think he was right.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> You also discuss in here that Davis tended to be a micromanager.</p>
<p>
<b><i>WJC:</i></b> Only in one sense.  He was a micromanager in Richmond in directing the war.  He had several Secretaries of War and all but one was quite able.  But in dealing with his generals he was not a micromanager.  I argue emphatically that he was not, that in fact, he should have managed them more carefully and more closely.  When he appointed a senior general to a major post he basically left that general alone.  He might make suggestions and he did make suggestions, but he was not a micromanager of his generals in the field—not at all.  I would argue that Lincoln was much more of a micromanager over his generals in the field than Davis.  But in running the general war, letters left the War Department with the Secretary of War’s signature and with the adjutant general's signature, but all the decisions were Davis's decisions. You can look at the materials he looked at, and as president the stuff that came across his desk you can see his endorsements.  Does a piece of artillery go here or there?  He liked to talk to his Secretaries of War and would have long conversations with them.  He wanted them to talk and he wanted their opinions, but he made the final decision on almost everything.  But once appointed somebody as a general—even people he didn't really like very much—he left them out there to do what they would do.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b>  In Davis's estimation the Confederacy faced ""victory and liberty, or defeat and enslavement.""  Did he ever talk of defeat and enslavement, in particular, in the postbellum years?</p>
<p>
<b><i>WJC:</i></b>  No.  During the war he did say we that if we lose, we will become slaves of a horrible North.  After the war he kept very quiet about public questions, particularly because he had been imprisoned and he had never become reconciled to the new order of things in terms, for example, trying to get his citizenship back.  He refused to do that.  He realized that if he made any comments about public matters, it would only serve to hurt those he cared most about, that is, the South and the southern states.  So he didn't comment publicly on public matters.  In terms in what was happening inside the South, privately he did feel that during the Reconstruction years that the South was basically in servitude.  He applauded the end of Reconstruction; he applauded the restoration of white supremacy.  And if you look at his public speeches in the 1880s, he is not a fellow who is standing up bemoaning and lamenting.  He is looking at the future; he is talking about the future.  He says he is proud of his country.  I think that's because by 1880, he saw that the South was back in the hands of those people that he thought should have control of it.  But during Reconstruction, he never made a public comment about Reconstruction that I know of.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b>  Now in sort of the same vein, you state that Davis believed that Northerners, especially the Republicans, challenged the Americanness of the South.  Did Jefferson Davis see his ""holy crusade"" as a way to prove that Southerners were true Americans, and in Davis’s mind was the true America lost with the death of the Confederacy?</p>
<p>
<b><i>WJC:</i></b>  Davis saw the Confederacy as the true America without any question.  He believed that.  When the Confederacy failed, as Davis said toward the end of his life, many of his hopes and aspirations fell with it and his conviction about the future fell.  But then I think, as I try to argue, that by 1880 his view had changed; that he is much more optimistic, that he applauds his country.  He says that all Southerners should be proud Americans. I think he thought by the end of Reconstruction that the America he had cherished was in fact gone, but there was an America there that deserved southern loyalty and southern allegiance. And it had his loyal allegiance, though he refused to do those things that would have given him his citizenship back, because in his own mind he said, ""those people didn't have the right to take it, so I don't have the right to hold it; I'm not going to give them the opportunity to give it back to me or reject me."" You can say that was pretty stiff-necked, but that was holding to a dogma he had about the legitimacy of what he had done in 1861, its constitutionality, and the correctness of it.  But if you look at the last public address he gave to a group of young men near his home on the Mississippi coast in the last years of his life, he tells those young people that they need to look forward, that they can't be trapped by the past and they should be proud of being Americans.</p> 
 <p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> Now in your last essay you raise a really fascinating point about the creation of the Lost Cause ideology, and you mention in there that the Lost Cause ideology was based in some part on omitting slavery from the history of the Civil War.  What role did Davis play in creating that Lost Cause ideology and in trying to create it in part by omitting the idea of slavery from the causes of the Civil War?</p>
<p>
<b><i>WJC:</i></b> In that last essay, I argue that Davis had a very important role to play.  He was not young enough, as some of the men who historians normally point to as the real founders of the Lost Cause ideology, but was an older man and older generation.  If you look at his memoir, <i>The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government</i>, which was published in 1881, he specifically says in it that slavery was not the cause of war.  If you look at the remarks he made in Montgomery in 1886, which was the focus of that essay, again there is nothing said about slavery. But if you contrast those remarks with the remarks he made in Montgomery in 1861, when he was the provisional president, in both his actual inaugural address and the remarks he made in public before that in Montgomery he put slavery at the very forefront of what was going on.  So I think he was absolutely in sync, if you will, with the general thrust of southern opinion at that time that was putting slavery and race out of it. The unity of North and South was coming, was taking place and nobody wanted to talk about slavery, and Southerners certainly didn't.</p>

<p><strong><i>Civil War Book Review (CWBR)</i></strong>: Today the Civil War Book Review is proud to speak with William S. King, an independent scholar making his debut in the Civil War Era, and discuss his book, <i>To Raise Up A Nation: John Brown, Fredrick Douglass, and The Making of A Free Country</i>. Thank you for joining us today.</p>

<p><strong>William S. King (King)</strong>: Well I'm glad to be here. </p>

<p><strong><i>CWBR</i></strong>: So just to get us started, describe to me what brought you to this subject, not only recovering John Brown as a key player, but then linking him to Fredrick Douglass and using these two lives to sort of tell this very large story of the era? </p>

<p><strong>King</strong>: Yes, well my links with John Brown go back to my earliest childhood.  I lived in that area of Kansas in the early 1950's with my parents and have active memories through the years, of the battlefields there, of John Brown's presence. More than that I would say in the development toward my journey to writing something like this was the impact of the Civil Rights Movement in the United States. In all of its phases, and I feel that I have been very shaped and profoundly affected by it in all of its phases. I think to really to really put a point on it one of the impetuses of me developing toward was the killings that developed, of course Medgar Evers, Martin Luther King himself and Malcom X, and many others that sacrificed their lives in a very American way in the sense that they were targeted individuals, because they became outspoken and became effective. In this struggle that we've had in America we've had with race relations, but my initial contact which moved me into this book was reading Du Bois’ <i>John Brown</i> and there one has a point meeting in the stone quarry outside Chambersburg between Fredrick Douglass and John Brown. Essentially all we know about it come from Douglass's narration of it in his <i>Life and Times</i>, and of course he talked about it in a few other venues as well. At the end of his account Brown puts his arm around Douglass after two days of discussion, and it was a comprehensive discussion, when he says, ""Come with me Douglass I will defend you with my life. When I strike the bees will begin to swarm and I shall want you to help me hive them."" But Douglass as we know refused to go and broke off with John Brown at that point, and the rest transpired. I wanted to write that story and that led me to the other biographies of John Brown and Fredrick Douglass, and his own writings (<i>Life and Times</i>), the works of Benjamin Quarrels, and Phil Foner. That story gets repeated but is never elaborated on, causing my reading to keep branching out. I was living in New York City at the time and I had the great fortune of getting laid off—this was back in the 1970s—and took myself to the New York library picking books I had noticed in my reading, which were interesting and out of print coming from the nineteenth century volumes. I began reading in, crucially, in some people that had known Brown and had written biographies of him notably Richard Hinton, Franklin Sanborn, and James Redpath. I began, not having been able to write anything yet, but just gathering notes and experience, which grew out. I had been familiar with the story the Civil War, several years prior to this I had read the entire series by Bruce Catton on the Civil War.  That's basically what it was and I struggled with this writing for a number of years and kept reading. That is where it began its development, from that specific incident in the stone quarry outside Chambersburg. </p>

<p><strong><i>CWBR</i></strong>: It sounds like part of what drew you to the story of Brown was this (and the link that would obviously connect him to much later figures you mentioned Dr. King and Medgar Evers), is this notion of sacrifice and then is that sort of the link that then led you to branch out and explore the myriad instances of sacrifice--many of them nameless—by these people that are soldiers and commanders? </p>

<p><strong>King</strong>: I think that’s really the crux of it, although I don’t overtly state that, but I think that's what moved me through this.  And it's a process of revelation too, because there is so much that's obscure about this aspect of antebellum period because there's such contradictory views on John Brown and the understanding of what he did is very ill thought-out in most, if not all regards. The relationship of Douglass and Brown, which is crucial to understand this whole era, has not been a source to study for everybody.  They leave it at the brief statements that Douglass makes, and Brown didn't make any, then leave it at that. But there's a whole area that can be open up to this portal, as it were.   </p>

<p><strong><i>CWBR</i></strong>: Do you think that part of how Brown has been misunderstood is basically then what sort of prevents people from exploring the relationship between Brown and Douglass?  You mention early in the book that Brown has sort of become this caricature; he's sort of eternally the depiction in the <i>Tragic Prelude</i> that hangs in the Kansas state house, of this larger than life kind of crazy man. How does that prevent us from exploring his relationship with Douglass? </p>

<p><strong>King</strong>: Well in the matters that pertain to the Civil War his story by in large has not really had a comprehensive grasp of the nature in the meaning of American slavery. The fact that it is often a peripheral discussion in the matters of the civil war, even a great work like Bruce Catton's volumes. I recall him saying in his book <i>The Coming Fury</i>, which was on the precursor to the Civil War, the 1850's, he really devotes one line to state of the slaves and their stake in the issue saying, ""the mute and luckless negro."" That's his phrase and he really doesn't develop a view of slavery or of the agencies blacks really had, both enslaved and free, in bringing on that war and in its resolution. I find that many historians, and my latest experience was with David Blight, a professor at Yale University who is a magnificent scholar on the Civil War as you know, I just happened to take myself to the internet and watched his twenty-two part lecture series of an hour each on the Civil War. He devotes a whole chapter to John Brown, but is appallingly miserable in his discussion of Brown as a historical figure. Partly that is because they haven't felt that they really had to think through what he did and they’re deriving all their information from sources that really had a negative view about him and haven't penetrated for several reasons the meaning of Harpers Ferry. In one of them they sort of cap the whole thing on this notion that he was trying to raise a slave insurrection there of significant proportions, which I show in the book was not the case at all, and certainly it would have defeated all efforts he was trying to accomplish there if he had been able to do that, which is just fantastical. I just find that they haven't thought it through, which is a great failing of scholarship because there is plenty of material available. Notably, in Brown's on words, if you really study them if you get away from this notions of him being a mono-maniac who was mad and was a bloodthirsty, cold blooded killer, which he wasn't. You have to see what he was grappling with and the difficulties presented. One of the things I was able to bring out was that he was definitely trying to foreshorten what he saw to be the terrible war that did come. He saw that, and it wasn’t a fantastical, God-driven apparition, he really understood his time, and the potentials that war would unleash. Although there is magnificent work done, I don’t think scholars have really gotten to the root of that war. </p>

<p><strong><i>CWBR</i></strong>: So, you have, as I understand as your saying, when you're trying to decide how to evaluate Brown, and of course evaluating Brown sort of a matter of deciding which of his words to weigh his actions against. It seems that a lot of historians have weighed his state of mind against his words where he says, oh I would like to seize the armory and start and insurrection. So they have decided that weighed against those goals, Brown must have been a failure and basically, as I understand, what you're saying is historians should take more seriously when he writes about the moral impetus slavery and how very seriously he took that? Since for him the political issue couldn’t be divorced from the moral issue, so then the evaluation of what he's doing shouldn't be either? </p>

<p><strong>King</strong>: Right, but I think they still miss the point in terms of what he was trying to accomplish at Harpers Ferry. It was not a slave insurrection in the terms it's been conceived in most commentary. His son, who's mentioned in the book, had an interesting remark saying that all writers had failed to appreciate that his father was trying to bring about the split in the Union. That was his point of striking at Harpers Ferry. It was not an irrational, ill thought-out thing. He was trying to topple the very foundation of the political structure of the Union which at that time had a huge slavery component, and was undermining the foundations of the republic as he saw. He was kicking the legs out from under the stool.</p>

<p><strong><i>CWBR</i></strong>: That is very interesting about the perspective that you bring because John Brown is not completely alone in this of course. One thing I found very interesting about the book is that you're always keeping track of the more familiar Civil War narrative, but as the same time this is a story that is often told from the perspective of so-called extremists. You're highlighting the grassroots narratives that are essentially the opposite of those examined by our last guest, Rachel Sheldon, who wrote about this sort of “Washington bubble,” the fact that a lot of these politicians in Washington, they do conceive of these things as completely political issues with political solutions and they're really surprised by secssion and by the ferocity of the war. In many ways the war is a rejection of them and we're seeing that here too. We're seeing fire-eaters seceding against Lincoln's initial expectations and we see Wendell Phillips echoing John Brown by welcoming secession, because it's going to eventually seal abolition. It’s an intriguing juxtaposition, the sort of a larger narrative that I think a lot of readers will find very familiar, and then this sort of grassroots undercurrent. Would it be fair to say you think the grassroots as not only dragging the nation to the conflict, which I think a lot of historians would agree with, but that consistently the grassroots has to keep dragging laggard military planning and politics throughout the war? </p>

<p><strong>King</strong>: Yes, I agree 100% on that, though their defeat is what compelled them to go in the direction the grassroots were pulling them. They weren't able to resolve this war in fact they were on the verge a number of times and people like to point this out that there could have been a Southern victory. It wasn't impossible, or there could have been a victory that was achieved with an independence of sorts, of course things would have continued after that, that wouldn't resolved anything at all. It did come to a revolutionary peak. It was a complete transformation that fact that they accepted these regiments of black soldiers after the Emancipation Proclamation. It's not at all that they had a significant impact on the battlefield. They had an impact and at times an important one, but the underlying fact was the whole direction and the meaning of a confederacy was undermined by that fact, of these black men in arms who have been enslaved in the south. That utterly defeated slavery. It couldn't go on. They had then to throw in the towel even though they continued to fight on, because it was a possibility even as late as Appomattox that there could have been a political compromise. That compromise didn't go away with defeat of the confederacy it reemerged as you note in a Reconstruction and the defeat of Reconstruction. </p>

<p><strong><i>CWBR</i></strong>: I actually would like to hear you talk about that a little bit more because so much of the second half of the book does show what you were just talking about, how important it is that there are black Americans taking agency in their own emancipation, and it doesn't come down to whether they win or lose individual engagements in which they're deployed, it's the fact that they're there. But then the war does conclude with this disappointment of reconstruction. </p>

<p><strong>King</strong>: Well actually I mentioned David Blight earlier, he had suggested the question of when did reconstruction end? He ends with the interesting idea that it never ended, in other words that struggle within our history has continued down to today. It has a very different flavor and balance of forces and dynamic in each succeeding decade, but it's continued to roll on, never with complete resolution, never yet with complete quality and acceptance of the black nation within the United States. We continue to see--I don't need to bring up examples--but Ferguson would seem coincidental, but I don’t think it can be considered coincidental. </p>

<p><strong><i>CWBR</i></strong>: Do you think that kind of falling short, or perhaps the fact that it never really does resolve in a positive fashion, would lead you to say that [lack of resolution] has something to do with the fact that as powerful as this grassroots impetus can be, it's also very tough to turn into a cohesive structure? Or would you say that really the problem is not that the grassroots impetus for freedom wasn't strong enough, but that there's this continuing and ongoing grassroots kind of counter-revolution in American history that's always trying to push back?   </p>

<p><strong>King</strong>: In history I would say it continually shows itself in new forms, but also it needs new forms of defeat. There's no promised land and no resolution of struggle in human existence. We should hope, we may be faced with it, but that's extinction I think, a society without history. History is the narration of the struggles. People who study this aren't always aware of it of course or some are, but it is continually re-presented. The Civil War era is a classic case of that. People are stirred by images of combat and in who was there or what canteens they carried or armaments and all of that. I find that I had to pay attention to the strategic and tactical points of these battles. In the writing of it I wrote in terms of what I thought was essential in terms of its strategic importance. I brought to the foreground what had not been present in most histories of the Civil War which was the black presence in it, and that black agency, which was important to the resolution it had in that period. I quote Douglass on one of his magnificent speeches late in the war when they had a convention of blacks to consider he said, ""Come let us reason together. You may not have such an opportunity in 100 years,"" and that exactly what it took before there was that upsurge that we saw in the 50's and 60's (historians know the incidents and conditions).  Of course there were people and events prior to that, but that grassroots movement come up again in a magnificent way. This is the essential American story, that struggle.  I don’t believe it’s resolved in any one period. The struggle adjourned from the battlefields to other venues, to the social venue and to the courts, and the mass movements. We did neglect poor Fredrick Douglass and John Brown in this discussion, that I think is the key which is why I subtitled the book <i>John Brown, Frederick Douglass and The Making of a Free Country</i>. That was a crucial relationship in our American narrative, and it has been neglected. Of course there’s been recent scholarship The [James Oakes] book, <i>The Radical and The Republic</i>. I based myself largely on Douglass's own writings in his journalism and his speeches which merits a lot more attention than it usually gets. I let him speak in a full sense on many occasions there are actual words and writings. It's interesting to think too that Douglass, his house burnt down, he lost all of his volumes of the <i>North Star</i>, Frederick Douglass’ paper, all of these papers and correspondence, and he remarks in <i>Life and Times</i> if he said or did anything important it was in the period covered in the papers he lost in that fire which was 1845 through 1860. Yet most people study him after the civil war as a figure in that period.</p>

<p><strong><i>CWBR</i></strong>: Also the period where he knew John Brown. </p>

<p><strong>King</strong>: Yes and that was going to be my next statement. All of his work on John brown, so scholars haven't had the benefit of going directly to those papers. I was mentioning Phillip Foner's volumes the <i>Life and Writings of Fredrick Douglass</i>, which is a 5 volume series. I don't know how many people read those, but I've broke the backs of several of them, bent the pages right out the book in find that it is a marvelous history of the period, in the most comprehensive sense. It's not incidental or undeserving of study, and I’m sure many scholars have gone to it, but I don't think it's been quite appreciated to the extent that merits even yet. Brown and Douglass, the meaning of their relationship the depth and contact I try to bring out in the book but the skeleton is based on Douglass's on writings. </p>

<h3>Interview with Dr. Richard Slotkin</h3><br>
<h3>Interviewed by Nathan Buman</h3>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR: </b></i> My first question, what led you to venture away from your three-volume study of the American frontier in <i>Gunfighter Nation, The Fatal Environment, and Regeneration Through Violence</i> to examine the Battle of the Crater during the American Civil War? </p>
<p>
<b><i>RS: </b></i> Well I’ve always been interested in the civil war, in fact my interest in American history in general really dates from two things: western movies when I was growing up and visits to civil war battlefields and for various reasons having to do with the way my education went that my career developed I  wasn’t professionally licensed to write about the Civil War coming out of graduate school but I was so interested in it that it was always in the back of my mind as something I wanted to do.  It’s really to me the water shed of American history.  It’s the place where the United States turned into the unified nation-state that we’ve got the industrialized nation state and it’s also the moment when our perennial conflict between racialism and belief in equality comes to a head and the issue really takes a modern form.  </p>
<p> 
<b><i>CWBR: </b></i> What if any are some of the similar themes that you can trace across your frontier analysis and your look at the crater?  It seems to me that you have in part shown a similar trend toward imagery through conflict to detail very differing frontiers. </p>
<p>
<b><i>RS: </b></i> Yeah, I see that I focused on the way in which, let’s change this.  The key to the stuff I've done on the frontier is the idea that we've as a culture we've always seen violence as an essential means for producing the nation that we became and in the frontier what makes the United States ""American"" is the conflict with the Native Americans so there is always a racial dimension in there from the start and that combination of racism and violence has a different form but a parallel form in the Civil War where both sides are grappling with the question of: what is the relation between white and black?  Is it potentially a relationship of equality; that is are blacks Americans as well as whites? or is the United States a white man’s republic and that issue, which in a sense begins on the Indian frontier, comes home in the Civil War and it comes home with tremendous violence.  It’s my contention that the South secedes, primarily, to preserve white supremacy; slavery as an institution yes but as an institutional means for the preservation of white supremacy and the North doesn't get it in those terms.  The North thinks that slavery and white supremacy are two different issues and one of the things that happens is as the North confronts the end of slavery and particularly as the soldiers on the battle line confront the question: shall I fight for the end of slavery, what succeeds slavery what comes after is the question of black equality.  And northern whites as well as southern whites are violently freaked out by that notion and the thing about the Battle of the Crater is: it ends with a massacre of black troops, not only by Confederates who are storming the position the blacks are occupying, but white troops on the northern side turn against the blacks and kill them as well.  </p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR: </b></i> So it’s almost like the Battle of the Crater and the American Civil War are sort of a frontier in itself towards that unified nation-state. </p>
<p>
<b><i>RS: </b></i> Yeah it’s a frontier in a sort of symbolic sense, the frontier between, or the borderlands, between two different Americas.  In one of which white supremacy is assumed and slavery exists and the other slavery is removed and now you have to ask yourself: are you still in favor of white supremacy? </p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR: </b></i> Well much of your narrative focuses on the experiences of the United States Colored Troops as you say, and their enlistment in the war following emancipation in the proclamation. Do you think the enrollment of black soldiers altered the course of the war politically and/or ideologically and how so? </p>
<p>
<b><i>RS: </b></i> I think it altered it in both ways. First of all, just in terms of numbers: I think the statistics show there were something like the North had a little bit over 2 million men under arms during the Civil War.  By the end of the war nearly 200,000 troops, almost 10% were African American.  That’s very significant and is actually even more significant since their presence is weighted into the last two years of the war and although they don’t take a leading role in most major battles the Crater is an exception in that way.  Their role is absolutely essential; there is a whole corps of black troops in the army of the Potomac by the end of the war so just militarily their entirely significant.  Politically and socially, war is about politics as well as about tactics and the fact that black troops could come marching through slave territory in the South had a tremendous impact on the stability of the slave-based economy even before northern success guaranteed the end of slavery.  And the political issue in the North, by the 1864 election.  In the 1864 election, the Democrats contest Lincoln’s administration with essentially a campaign for white supremacy, arguing that to preserve white supremacy you have got to throw the Republicans out.  When Lincoln is endorsed by popular vote the possibility of something like a movement in the direction of racial equality gets a certain kind of credibility so the role politically, socially, and tactically is highly significant. </p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR: </b></i> Well what did the blacks’ fighting experience itself accomplish for African Americans that simple freedom through emancipation could not? </p>
<p>
<b><i>RS: </b></i>  Well you have to remember that the right to serve in the militia or in the army is a fundamental civil right, the famous Second Amendment has not only to do with fire arms, ""the right to bear arms,"" explicitly deals with the right serve in the national defense and until 1863 blacks were barred from militia service in all the northern states including Massachusetts.  And admission to that civil right has a tremendous symbolic and cultural impact.  Remember also that this is a country in which only men can vote and which the concept of manhood is almost indistinguishable from the concept of political equality or political rights.  So if you admit blacks to the civil right of service as men bearing arms the cultural impact is immense.  Even those blacks who never see combat have their sense of self and their sense of their possibilities of self turned around by military service.  I think studies have shown that blacks who served in the military tended to do better in Reconstruction than those who didn’t, in part because they learned a certain skill as soldiers as well but the psychological impact I think is immense.  </p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR: </b></i> Well on page 328 you state that the mine explosions seem to be ""an extraordinary escalation in the murderous cruelty and destructive power of the federal war effort"" and Charles Royster has discussed the destructive nature of the war that made the conflict increasingly exhaustive for soldiers and civilians alike.  How did the Battle of the Crater change warfare and the psyche or the psychological aspects of both armies? </p>
<p>
<b><i>RS: </b></i> Well I think you have to put it on, again, a kind of continuum of developments.  The technology of violence gets upped by the Civil War and that’s what the crater explosion is part of.  The Confederate army invented the use of land mines during the Civil War.  A Confederate officer did that. That too was regarded by generals on both sides as un-chivalrous as an illegitimate means of making war, almost as bad as the use of poison gas.  In fact, the use of poison gas was actually proposed by several officers on both sides during the course of the Civil War.  Technology made it impossible but there it is.  Once you go to war the use of violence and violent means to win the war becomes primary over time but part of it takes again this technological form.  The other side of it, the part that Royster talks about, is the willingness to inflict pain and social destruction in order to obtain victory and that’s, I think, the bigger side of it technology is one thing but the will to kill the will to destroy is upped intensively the longer that a war goes on particularly where the issues are so fundamental as they are in the civil war.  </p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR: </b></i> Well why do you feel that the slaughter occurred to the degree that it did in the crater specifically the inter-racial violence.  Is it confederates who are blaming black soldiers for the waning fortunes of the Confederacy or were they afraid that the social hierarchy based on white supremacy was crumbling or was it simpler than that? </p>
<p>
<b><i>RS: </b></i> Well I think that both of those things are true.  That is, they do feel that the presence of blacks is really a major contribution to the overthrow of the Confederacy.  Remember, not only because of the numbers that they are now facing but the fact that the presence of black troops carries with it the implied threat of a slave uprising behind the lines and the intense racial hatred is also a part of it.  But one of the most critical things which I point to in the book is the role of Confederate officials in establishing a framework of law and policy which encouraged racial murders.  The Confederacy had officially taken the position that blacks captured in arms would not be taken prisoner and that the white officers leading these troops should be treated under Confederate state law as persons inciting a slave insurrection which made them liable for the death penalty.  Now fear of Federal retaliation led the Confederacy to back off from officially enforcing the policy but as I quote in the book the Confederate Secretary of War said, yeah we can't do this publicly, but let's do it secretly.  Let the killing be done red-handed on the field of battle rather than taking these guys prisoners and then executing them.  So what you get then is a kind of uneven enforcement in which local officers and private soldiers even granted permission by their government to do these killings they either do the killings or they refuse to do the killings.  So what I think is true here is that the Confederate government sets a frame in which racial murders are approved and soldiers in the heat of battle act in that framework and they regard their actions therefore as not only justified by their emotions but also justified by the policy of their government.  In that way I parallel it with atrocities like the My Lai massacre in Vietnam.  Some of it is on the troops in the field but there's also this framework of policy which makes murder and indiscriminant killing either inevitable or something that's approved. </p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR: </b></i> well you suggest that the result of the battle of the crater may have lead to Lincoln’s failure in the November 1864 election that it could have been possible for him to…</p>
<p>
<b><i>RS: </b></i> Yeah he succeeds, but what it produces is a really bad moment for his political campaign and the battle occurs at the end of July.  In August he writes that famous memorandum which he requires his cabinet officers to sign without reading which commits them to win the war before the new president takes office on the grounds that the guy who beats Lincoln will have won on a peace platform that will end the war without victory.  So Lincoln is pretty discouraged at that point and justifiably so by the failure of this big battle; other things as well but this was the big fight that had occurred right before that. </p>
<p>  
<b><i>CWBR: </b></i> Do you think that Lincoln’s discouragement and concern over the election results, was that more due to the mounting casualties of Grant's Virginia campaign or is that as a result of the increasing concerns over the enlistment and the use of black soldiers throughout the north in the civilian population? </p>
<p>
<b><i>RS: </b></i> in Lincoln’s case I think it's more the casualties.  He had already taken into account the backlash against his recruitment of black troops and one of the things that I think is remarkable about this period is the uncompromising forthright way in which Lincoln defends the blacks and the use of black troops and even uses the fighting of black troops as an argument for ultimately granting them civil equality.  There's a great speech which I quote in the book in which he contrasts the loyalty and service of black soldiers with the disloyalty and foot-dragging of white Democrats. </p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR: </b></i> David Blight has suggested that northern and southern whites erased African Americans from commemoration after the civil war leading into the 20th century, focusing instead on the collaborative white memory of the conflict.  Why do you think the efforts to the United States Colored Troops at the Battle of the Crater have been ignored and why do they posses as you say ""no monument to the memory of the African American troops who fought and died in the crater""? </p>
<p>
<b><i>RS: </b></i> Well Blight's book on that subject is absolutely correct.  In the case of the crater battle we can actually see that in the speeches that were made during the reenactments that were developed in order to create a battlefield park, that blacks are deliberately excluded from that.  And part of the reason is that at the time that these commemorative movements are really gaining strength and influence this is the Jim Crow era in southern politics, when blacks who had gained civil rights in the post war period have those civil rights taken away by state action and this is when the regime of segregation and the elimination of blacks from the voting roles is taking place in the South and also the great waves of lynching in the South.  So it’s that sort of groundswell shift in southern politics that I think is part of that denial of a black role in the Battle of the Crater.  In a way though from the northern side it's consistent with what happened during the battle, that is to say the northerners in the battle identified more with their fellow whites than with their black comrades in arms and that tendency is carried through in the postwar period  as well. </p>

<i><b><p> Civil War Book Review (CWBR): </i></b>   Today the Civil War Book Review is proud to speak with Kathryn Shively Meier, an Assistant professor of History at Virginia Commonwealth University, and discuss her recent book <i>Nature's Civil War: Common Soldiers and the Environment in 1862 Virginia.</i> Thank you for joining us today.</p>

<p><b> Kathryn Shively Meier (KM):</b> Thank you for having me.</p>

<i><b><p> CWBR: </i></b> What first brought you to this topic?</p>

<p><b>KM:</b> In reading Civil War common soldier accounts, their letters, diaries, memoirs, I quickly noticed that soldiers discussed nature all the time giving, what seemed like, daily accounts of weather, climate, flora, and fauna. But scholars have never really analyzed why, and I began to wonder if there was more to it than simply bored farmers just sitting around looking at their environment. So when I started investigating it a little more closely, I realized that soldiers believed that environment was responsible for some of the deadly diseases that they were facing. For instance, they believed miasma, bad water, seasonal shifts, the southern climate were causing things like diarrhea and dysentery, and those two were the top killers of the war, as well as some others like malaria and typhoid. And further, a variety of mental unfortunates, like melancholy, home sickness, loneliness. The ending of the Civil War, of all of the mortalities, 2/3 of them would be from disease and yet most scholarly medical histories have been focusing on battle wounds. Also, they had mainly been focused on the top down, like medical personnel, rather than the soldiers themselves. So ultimately, I decided I wanted to focus on mental and physical health through the eyes of the soldiers in this war.</p>

<i><b><p> CWBR: </i></b> What were the challenges you faced in doing your research?</p>

<p><b>KM:</b>  Actually one of the problems was a good problem, which was an overabundance of sources, because as anyone who has read Civil War soldiers’ accounts knows nearly every soldier in this environment and health. So it was the opposite of the needle-in-a-haystack type of research. Which is why it ultimately shows to do a case study. But sort of a problem that I had, and this was one of bigger problems, was in charting mental health because official records really only recorded the most severe mental illness. So things like insanity, suicide, and what was contemporarily called nostalgia, which was a potential deadly case of home sickness. So in order to gain a nuance understanding of soldier's mental landscapes and how they were influenced by the environment, I had to take a more in-depth approach rather than a broad approach. My core study ended up being just a couple hundred individual soldiers because I had to literally map out their daily moves over a course of a year, which I did in an Excel spreadsheet, and I charted each time a man mentioned being melancholy or happy or even when he did not mention it but you could discern the mood shifts in his writing, and I had to figure out why that was happening. Was it linked to weather? Or health? To losing his friends to disease? etc. Ultimately I knew that morale shifts had serious consequences for Army operations because you could see that a soldier who had very low morale starts to unravel, deserts, disobeys orders, drink, and just performs poorly in his job. So I did the same technique then for physical illnesses as well. Even though there are official records, which are much better on the U.S. side than the Confederate side, for physical health, those records are really spotty because the way soldiers reported to sick call in the morning. Looking at their daily physical landscapes as well, I saw how sick they really were. It was very rare to find a soldier that wasn’t suffering from diarrhea nearly every day. The picture that emerged for me was an army that was really struggling to stay well enough to just be minimally adequate to the grueling task of soldiering every day. </p>

<i><b><p> CWBR: </i></b> So, what was the state of medical care and knowledge before the war and did this play an important role in how soldiers dealt with their environment during the war?</p>

<p><b>KM:</b> The state of medical care before the war is best described as chaotic. The Civil War occurred a decade before the discovery of germ theory and about two decades before the discovery of insect-borne illness. Medical profession was not very much influx before the war, as traditional surgeons were still clinging to humoral theory, the idea that the body was made up of fluids in need of balancing and they do so by what we call heroic interventions, these dramatic interventions to balance these fluids. Bleeding, purging, high doses of often mercury based medicine. Some of this was beginning to fall out of favor, but this was still the mainstream of medicine. But for people who become soldiers, they have fairly little experience with professional doctors before the war, and very little experience with hospitals. The preferred being treated at home by family members, usually women. They tended to believe that disease was caused by observable things they could see and feel, so environmental factors. For instance, there was a widely held fear that the South was a more harmful disease environment, and if you lived there you would have to undergo a process of seasoning in order to adjust. So the soldiers who went to war in 1861 and 1862 were products of an antebellum culture that was on one hand suspicious of professional medical care, and on the other hand emphasized self-reliance and environmental explanations of disease. One of the interesting things, at the beginning of the war there were a whole lot of Confederate posturing at how maybe the Yankees would come down South and all die in the southern swamps. Under the circumstances of Army life where you have 50,000 to over 100,000 men living together in mobile cities without infrastructures. Well the truth was they all got sick. Virginia was changed by war to become hospital disease environment for everyone. There were dead bodies everywhere, polluted water sources, landscapes ripped up from combat and mobilization. A lot of their pre-held beliefs were tested. Many had assumed that hearty country boys would spare them in the harsh environment of war. Early on, it was city men who spared best because they had already been exposed to crowd diseases when they were young like scarlet fever. So, a lot of conceptions were tested when they went to war. </p>

<i><b><p> CWBR: </i></b> The campaigns you cover in your work are very different, how did each area present environmental challenges to soldiers and how did they deal with these challenges?</p>

<p><b>KM:</b>  So I chose the 1862 Virginia Peninsula and Shenandoah Valley Campaign because they were concurrent and overlapped. Also, because contemporaries viewed these two locations as very different environments. They viewed the peninsula as deadly because of its swamps, and they viewed the valley as hostile because it was mountainous and famous for its beautiful hot springs. The areas were challenging to soldiers in slightly different ways. The valley had more extreme weather shifts, particularly in the spring season. The campaign there required a very quick and grueling case of marching, particularly for the Confederates under Stonewall Jackson. The peninsula alternately took place in swampy areas. It was really bad water, and the pace of the campaign was much slower. Soldiers on both sides were stagnant. The peninsula was more taxing to health in the summer because of the swarms of mosquitoes that spread malaria. The soldiers thought that malaria was being caused by swamp miasma. Even though the campaigns were different and the areas were different, the soldiers protected their mental and physical health in virtually identical ways and diverse locations. Using what I term in the book as self-care. These are techniques to combat environmental causes of disease and mental illness. So things like boiling water, bathing frequently, foraging for fruits and vegetables, eradicating insects, constructing protective shelters, etc. These techniques helped them stay physically healthier but also boosted their morale. The main variation of locations when it came to self-care actually had to do with the pace of the campaign rather than the environment itself. For instance, if you are camping in one area for a while, a soldier could rig a better tent construction to keep it dry and drain his camp of moisture by laying down sand, and that would keep away mosquitoes. However, if you were in an area for a long time that would mean your water source would get fouled from having thousands of soldiers defecating, washing, and touching all in one place. So that is an advantage to a fast pace campaign, so that you avoid the buildup of filth, if you will. </p>

<i><b><p> CWBR: </i></b> How good was the medical care apparatus of each army and how did soldiers react to the care officialdom tried to impose on them?</p>

<p><b>KM:</b>  The state of medical care in 1862 was not so good. However, on both sides it was starting to improve. When the war broke out, soldiers were forced into this official system that was really different from what they had known in the antebellum era. For instance, army surgeons often labeled them lingerers because the men were so sick so often that it seems implausible essentially to surgeons. When soldiers were treated, they despised the medicine they received, these heroic interventions, because they felt these medicines actually made them sicker. Then they were terrified to go to the hospitals because they were unfamiliar with hospitals in general and didn’t want to be treated by strangers. The least of what they had seen in the ranks were the majority of the regiments commanding them to come back home because of how the volunteers in the civil war were raised. So the consequence of this was that soldiers often avoided the official care offered by the medical department, or they supplemented it on their own by addressing what they believed to be the cause of these diseases, environment. They developed their own unofficial networks of care with comrades, civilians around the war front, and the ones back home to provide nursing, comfortable beds to recover in, and also to receive supplies and advice about how to care for their health. </p>

<i><b><p> CWBR: </i></b> Seasoning is something that almost all military histories talk of, but, in your view, what is seasoning and how did the environment play a role?</p>

<p><b>KM:</b>  The traditional military view of seasoning is that citizen soldiers have to undergo a shift being a civilian to learning how to endure combat. Scholars like Earl Hess are fantastic on that type of seasoning. Then there is also another type of seasoning that is recognized by scholars like Joseph Blatter, which is a phase when newer recruits first join an army and somewhere around 50% of them become sick with crowd diseases. That is important because America was so rural at the time. Joining the Army was like moving to the city, but with closer quarters and no infrastructures. In addition to those two phases, I see another, and that is after the initial influx of crowd diseases taxes, soldiers succumb to a phase of environmental seasoning, which would tax physical and mental health during the daily grind of soldiering. This is the phase where they learn to endure days, weeks, months outside with very little shelter, very little food, marching 10-20 miles a day before you found pass and these are little guys, like 135 pounds on average. This was an active process of becoming seasoned to the hardships. Some soldiers practiced self-care and became mentally and physically tough, while others really floundered becoming despondent and often very ill and dying. </p>

<i><b><p> CWBR: </i></b> Again, straggling is something important to commanders and military historians, could you explain though why it was important to soldiers' self-care?</p>

<p><b>KM:</b>  Commonly in the Civil War, straggling is conflated with desertion, which preserves a command bias from the time of the war. I think it is very important to draw distinction between temporary abandonment to one unit with the intent to return versus a permanent abandonment. There were many reasons to straggle, but I looked at a reason for the practice that wasn’t covered by the literature before and that is the men often straggled to practice self-care. When they became ill or despondent or the environmental burden of soldiering was too much to bare, they would often slip out of the ranks to seek shelter and recover maybe for just a night or two or sometimes for a little bit longer. In some cases they would actually seek out civilians to care for them; give them a bed to sleep in, give them food. Other cases of straggling for self-care was when rations were really poor.  For instance, they were not being issued fruits and vegetables. Sometimes soldiers would straggle for forage. This helped to prevent scabies. In other cases, if they were not being ordered to bathe frequently enough, which happened on Stonewall Jackson's Valley Campaign, they straggled to find clean water to bathe and keep clean and to drink. From the soldier perspective, straggling could be just the key to staying healthy enough to continue on. But, of course, from the command perspective, generals didn’t really consider that there were benefits to straggling. To them it meant and absence of available men to his campaign. It meant that the discipline in their army was poor. There is this kind of divide between the soldiers and generals here when it came to viewing straggling. Straggling became so pervasive over the course of 1862 that the medical departments were still so weak that command on both sides became to really crack down on the practice as the year went on, and impose torturous penalties. To give a few examples: Stonewall Jackson had four men court marshaled and executed as deserters, who claim they had only been straggling to serve the example because straggling was so bad in his army. Then, I say the most effective punishment in serving straggling was probably just restricting pay. By the end of the years, straggling had somewhat evaded. </p>

<i><b><p> CWBR: </i></b> How did what soldiers and the army learned during these two campaigns effect medical care and reactions to the environment in the rest of the war?</p>

<p><b>KM:</b> Soldiers continue to practice self-care throughout the war. Discipline did improve straggling and it was evaded. Both sides learned that their medical systems were inadequate to the task of caring for these massive armies, and went about improving hospitals, supplies, rations, etc. The U.S. really had an advantage with the intervention with the U.S. Sanitary Commission who had been investigating soldier camps and making recommendations for improved sanitation and environmental management. As well as providing supplies and nurses since the beginning of the war. In the Army of Potomac, the Union Army looked at a new medical director, Jonathan Letterman, who came in and addressed problems like ambulance evacuation to considerable affects starting in July of 1962. In the end, the Civil War had a much better track record than the Mexican-American War in terms of mortality due to disease. In the Mexican-American War, 80% of mortalities had been from disease and in this war, only 66% by war's end. However, I would argue that it remains very much due to credit of the soldiers themselves and the individual decisions they made caring for one another, and adapt to the environment of war. They were able to mentally and physically preserve here. </p>

<i><b><p>Civil War Book Review (CWBR)</i></b>: Today, we are pleased to speak with Professor Nichole Etcheson, the Alexander M. Bracken Professor of History at Ball State University and author of<i> A Generation of War: The Civil War Era in a Northern Community</i>.  Professor Etcheson, thank you so much for talking with us today.</p>
<b><p>Nichole Etcheson (NE): </b>Thank you for having me.</p>
<i><b><p>CWBR: </b></i>Historians have spent so much time looking at the factory owners and the laborers in the Northeast and slaveholders and non-slaveholders in the South, but you show us the farmers and the wider agricultural community of the Midwest and the Old Northwest.  Of all the counties and all of the northern states, why is Putnam County, Indiana an excellent area to study in order to understand how the American Civil War altered an entire generation of people? </p>
<b><p>NE: </b>As I say in the introduction, no county is going to be totally perfect and I did choose Putnam County, in part, because of a famous speech that was given there by a Copperhead politician, Dan Voorhies, right before the war began.  But, it seems to me, that Putnam County does a fairly good job of representing the North.  It’s a largely agricultural community, it is divided between Whigs and Democrats (and later, Republicans and Democrats), in an era, and in a state (Indiana) where the inter-party competition was quite fierce, and a lot of the home front studies of the North have looked at cities: Chicago, Boston, and Philadelphia.  And those are all wonderful additions to what we need to know about the northern home front but we have not had many studies that have looked at the northern home front and that have looked at rural areas, small-town areas that were more typical of the North.  Putnam County comes closer, I think, to being what much of the North was like.</p>
<i><b><p>CWBR: </b></i>In terms of your methodology, what is the value of a county study in our broader, more complete understanding of the Civil War era?</p>
<b><p>NE: </b>I call this a micro-history, meaning looking at a very tiny place, although I do take a larger slice of time than many home front studies of the Civil War which will concentrate on 1861-1865.  I look from, about, the end of the war with Mexico through the end of Reconstruction so I think that swath of time is a contribution.  But, in terms of micro-history, I really wanted to get a sense of how the war impacted individuals: soldiers, farmers, women, the black community in Putnam County because, really, this war swept up real people.  And it is hard to get a sense of that when you’re looking at the big political studies we have or the big military studies that we have.   The way that this impacted the lives of real human beings and I would suggest that, even though we are looking at very particular human beings in a very particular place, the kinds of things that happen to them-imprisonment, widowhood, gaining more rights-are taking place all over the country.  </p>
<i><b><p>CWBR: </b></i>You very cleverly begin the book with an account of the murder of Martha Ann Sublett Mullinex by her husband Greebury.  How does this incident illustrate the inter-party conflict, that you mentioned earlier, in the years leading up to the war?</p>
<b><p>NE: </b>Yes, Martha was murdered by her husband; they had not been married very long and he may have been mentally disturbed.  That is a little hard to tell in the newspaper accounts; he comes across as not quite “all there,” and he murders her with an axe.  But what interests me about that, it is a turning point in the county history-it is the last execution in the county-but the story is picked up by a young man, Miles Fletcher, who is a professor at the local university, and Miles Fletcher comes from a very prominent Indianapolis family.  And Miles turns, what might ordinarily be a very tragic story, into a revelation about the problems of the Democratic Party because the Mullinexes are Democrats, Fletcher is a rising Republican, and Greenbury drank, and his family manufactured liquor, and they were not interested in education, and the murderer’s uncle had ties to the governor of Indiana who was a Democrat, who managed to get a temporary stay of the execution through his Democratic political connections.   So Fletcher turns this all into a parable about how terrible the Democrats are, the way in which this is politicized, to reveal the differences between the two parties, I thought, was very interesting in the period before the Civil War.  It seemed to me that one of the constants throughout the Civil War period, issues about gender that were there in the marriage, issues about alcohol, all of these things continue through but Fletcher has no interest in, and there is no role played by race in this tragedy, but it will come to be the case over the years that race becomes a more and important of a factor to the life of the county.   </p>
<i><b><p>CWBR: </b></i> I was struck by the degree to which Putnam County seems to provide a micro-history, as you mention, in the presidential election of 1860 in which we see residents positioning themselves in four different corners.  It’s not simply a Lincoln-Douglas debate and I wonder, what made politics so complex as the county considered their choices in 1860?</p>
<b><p>NE: </b>Putnam County, one of the reasons I chose it, is that a state like Indiana, and a county like Putnam, had a substantial migration from the upper South.  So all through the 1850s you see these very strong, loyalties to Kentucky, to the South, that people in Indiana and people in this county feel that the growing Republican Party is picking on the South, that southern rights are under attack, and there is not much sympathy for abolitionism or antislavery.  At the same time, though, you do have the Whigs moving towards the Republican Party, not out of an antislavery sentiment, but out of the sense that it is the North that is the aggrieved party, that the North has been bullied constantly by the Slave Power of the South.  So when we get to 1860, it is mostly Douglas men versus Lincoln me-northern Democrat versus Republicans-arguing about which one of them can best represent the South.  There is a tiny, infinitesimal Constitutional Union, Bell movement but, what I found out and find quite interesting, was that there is a small Breckinridge movement led by some prominent local county officials, a Judge named Delana Eckels went about the county and about the state making speeches for the Southern Rights’ Democrats and John Breckinridge and that the margin that the Breckinridge voters polled in that county pushed the county to the Republicans.  It allowed the Republicans to win the county.  To my knowledge, we have tended to dismiss the Breckinridge movement in the North, but I wonder, if we did these kinds of micro-histories and looked at these results county-by-county, if we might find that some of the Republican margin of victory is owed more to the Southern Rights movement than we have heretofore known.</p>
<i><b><p>CWBR: </b></i>Looking at the war, it seems to me that many of Putnam’s residents opposed Republicans’ use of emancipation as a war aim.  If that is the case, what does that tell us about the long-standing slavery v. union debate?  Did Putnam County residents fight a different civil war?</p>
<b><p>NE: </b>They fought an internal civil war as well as a national civil war.  And certainly many, many hundreds of young men from Putnam County went off and they fought with Sherman and they fought with McClellan, and they fought under Grant, and they are owed a great deal for the victory that the Union eventually won.  But the county was very deeply divided and there was a very strong Copperhead, anti-war, Peace Democrat movement within the county.  And it mainly played out over issues of the draft and of emancipation, which is to say that the violent incidents that occurred in the county-draft officers being mobbed and draft officers being shot at-were about the draft.  People were organizing; the Copperheads of Putnam County were organizing.  They were forming mobs, if you want to call them that, that had a consistent pattern of intimidating the draft officials and trying to prevent the carrying out of the draft.  With emancipation, it was much more on the level of rhetoric of party resolutions that this was barbaric of the Lincoln administration to do this, that it confirmed what the Southern Democrats had been saying all along: that the Republicans were really an abolitionist movement.  So, I think there was war at both levels, on the local level and then on the national level.</p>
<i><b><p>CWBR: </b></i>In that tone, you seem to show that statewide, Indiana experiences a great deal of debate over the Thirteenth Amendment, and the state is the only one that chooses not to repeal its black laws.  Why does Indiana seem so racially conservative?</p>
<b><p>NE:</b> I think it was that southern migration; that was one of the major divisions for people.  I would go back even further to the origin of the black laws, as I talk in the book, to the Constitution of 1851, where Indiana instituted Article 13 of the Constitution which prohibited African Americans from coming into the state.  So, as you say, Indiana was a black law state; it had various prohibitions against equal rights for African Americans and that Article 13 had been ratified by an even bigger margin-it was ratified separately from the Constitution-and it got a bigger margin of victory than the Constitution itself.  So, I think that was due to the strong southern-roots population of Indiana.  And then what you’re referring to is that the state had a lot of difficulty shedding those attitudes and didn’t even get around, until constitutional revision until the 1880s, to repealing these black laws that had been nullified by the Civil War.  But I would also like to point out that, despite those attitudes, amazing things happened in Putnam County with race.  Republicans who, before they were Republicans, back when they were Whigs in the county in the 1850s, did <i>nothing</i> for black rights-actually were opposed to black rights-through the Civil War period and, perhaps for self-interested motives, they actually come, by the 1870s, to be recruiting African Americans to moving into the county.  So there is this legacy of racism but the Civil War era brings, I think, enormous strides. </p>
<i><b><p>CWBR: </b></i>You see, immediately after the war as you reference, Putnam residents seem as if they want to disassociate themselves from the discussion of race entirely and they focus, instead on economics or their support of or opposition to the war.  I wonder if I’m reading that correctly and, if that’s the case, why do politicians, locally, often push race to the periphery?</p>
<b><p>NE: </b>Well, there are still these long-standing issues.  One of the things I found was that temperance is always there; it is kind of pushed to the background during the Civil War but, after the Civil War, it emerges and it is just an incredibly big deal.  And women are very involved with the temperance movement so, although I don’t see women seizing upon the Civil War to get their rights-the kind of narrative that we have had, someone like Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who looked at the Civil War as an opportunity to seize political rights for women-Putnam County women don’t want that.  Most of them just want the men to come home and then, sometimes when the men don’t come home, they have to cope with the realities of getting on with life.  A lot of things that had been there before the war, the concern with economic development, the concern about temperance emerge again after the war, but the reality is that the war has changed the status of African Americans.  One of the families that I talk about in the book, the Townsends, are the long-resident free blacks, and for much of the period, the only free blacks in the county, their son serves in the 28th United States Colored Troops; he has a very tragic experience: he never sees combat, he becomes ill, he dies.  But nonetheless, there are people coming into the county, like the Townsends, who have served in the military.  Now that blacks are mobile, people are coming up from Kentucky and from other southern states and some of them have military service and they have the Fourteenth Amendment and the Fifteenth Amendment and they have a status that now has to be recognized.  People in the county have to come to terms with that.  So I think, yes, white people in the county would like to go back to the set of issues that had always preoccupied them but they have had a new set of issues has emerged.  And they have increasing numbers of people in the county who are going to push for those rights.  </p>
<i><b><p>CWBR: </b></i> I was struck, particularly, by how the Civil War changed gender roles.  Women had to work when men went to the war and when the men returned they, often, could not work.  How did pensions serve to maintain veterans’ manhood by enabling them the hope of providing for their family with their service during the crisis.  And, at the same time, how did pensions, on the other hand, alter the gender roles or the traditional role of a dependent woman?  I’m thinking specifically about Jennie Fletcher, whose husband and father-in-law failed to enable her to be an independent woman.</p>
<b><p>NE: </b>The Fletchers were very wealthy so ultimately Jennie Fletcher, when Miles dies, inherits enough money, and then when her father-in-law dies, she inherits enough from that estate that she is seemingly independent.  On the issue of pensions, pensions had different ramifications , I think, for different groups of people by race and class.  Some of what is interesting is that men who apply for these pensions don’t see it as a hand-out from the government.  One of the things that is interesting about these pension rolls is that, as these men age,  they have more and more problems which, I think it would be fair to say, is probably related to the fact that they are getting old; they can’t hear.  Lucius Chapin’s pension rolls, his teeth are falling out, he is getting into his seventies, he is having trouble hearing, he is having some mobility issues, and yet his pension applications take these all back to when he was in the army in Tennessee and Georgia and he had heat stroke, and <i>that</i> is why his teeth are falling out or he had a malarial fever back during the war.  So this is the cause of losing teeth and bad hearing.  We would probably say, well you’re aging; that’s why these things are happening to you.  The veterans want to see this, not as I’m getting older and I’m asking the government for money, as no, the government owes me this because this is happening to me because of what I did for the country thirty or forty years ago.  The pension file of one of the black veterans, Wyatt James, who was related to the Townsend family, who suffered some terrible-looking wounds in the Petersburg Campaign in 1864 and, on the one hand, historians have pointed out how black veterans can apply for these pensions and they can get remuneration just the way that white veterans do, so it makes white and black manhood equivalent.  On the other hand, Wyatt James is a laborer and the requirement is that he has to be disabled from laboring in order to qualify for the pension.  So, it seems to be a little bit harder for him to be getting a pension than for Lucius Chapin, who is a lawyer and doesn’t, presumably, need to work as physically hard to make this case as he is getting older for increased pensions.  The women who get pensions, Charity Townsend, who is the mother of the black soldier, Robert, it is kind of hard to find out what happened.  She apparently filed for a pension and didn’t get anything for a long time and then got a good pension agent who got her back payments-a couple thousand dollars-an extraordinary sum for a poor black woman in that period.  I think that testifies, again, to the government’s emphasis on equal rights: she is the mother of a soldier who died, she apparently had some difficulty navigating the pension application process at first but, when the gets there, she gets the back payment of a substantial amount.  And then, another woman, Elizabeth Applegate, she, I think, is the case where the pension allows her to be fairly independent.  Her husband had been a prisoner at Andersonville, he came home sick, he died shortly after the war, and she views this pension as <i>her</i> money and, over the years, it becomes divorced from this idea that it is her husband providing for her in perpetuity; she never remarries, she lives largely off of the pension, it seems, and is fairly independent.  Although, that is not ever what she wanted; she wanted John to come back from the war and provide for her as a man is supposed to do.  So it is an unintended consequence of the pension that she becomes a very independent-minded widow.  </p>
<i><b><p>CWBR: </b></i> You mention some of the strides that African Americans are able to make in the years after the war in the way that Putnam County alters the way that its viewpoint on race.  I wonder, generally speaking, does post-war Putnam County’s experience help explain African-Americans’ struggle to make social headway nationally leading into the Jim Crow period?  It seems to me that, while they are making strides, many white residents are simply apathetic about race in this period in Putnam County.  </p>
<b><p>NE:</b> Yes, some are.  There are two things going on.  One, of course, is that African Americans during the Civil War and during Reconstruction are seeking to better their condition.  So, by the 1870s, in particular, there builds up, in some areas of North Carolina dissatisfaction with the end of Reconstruction, with the re-imposition of discriminatory measures by the state of North Carolina, and so African Americans there start thinking about leaving.  But then there is also a coordinate movement in Indiana, and ultimately in Putnam County, to recruit blacks to come to the county.  And the white Republicans who do this-some of them are self-interested- want cheap labor, so they think former slaves from the South may work for less than white laborers in the county.  Some of it is, this is a very closely divided county, and local Republicans are looking to bring in Republican voters; everyone denies that this is going on.  That doesn’t seem to be how it started.  Local Democrats will say that they went out looking for voters; they’re importing voters.  It does not seem to have, then, the genesis of the movement but it certainly was a nice added side effect.  And so you get these white Republicans who were bringing in, or hoping to bring in, these North Carolina African Americans.  And local Democrats are certainly not indifferent about it; they are mad as hell and we talk about the Exoduster movement to Kansas and there was a national, congressional committee to investigate what was happening with the movement of blacks out of the South.  Because our focus has largely been on the movement from the Deep South to Kansas, we have tended to miss the fact that the whole reason to call this congressional committee into session was that they were worried (Democrats in Congress were worried) about black movement into Indiana.  That was really the origin of the congressional concern and a lot of the testimony was about Kansas but a lot of it was about Indiana as well, and in that local testimony you see local Democrats organizing to drive African Americans out.  Now, ultimately what happens is, a lot of these Exodusters who come to Putnam County, they end up leaving.  Many of them go to Indianapolis, some of it because racial prejudice was stronger in the countryside than they had been led to believe.  I think a lot of it has to do with there being less economic opportunity than they had been led to believe so they go to Indianapolis which is a larger, growing metropolis and there are more jobs there.  But some of these Exodusters stay in the county, some of them marry into the Townsend and form the real beginnings of the black community in the county.  </p>

<i><b><p> Civil War Book Review (CWBR): </i></b>  Today the Civil War Book Review is proud to speak with Rachel Shelden, Assistant Professor of History at the University of Oklahoma, and discuss her recent book <i>Washington Brotherhood: Politics, Social Life, and the Coming of the Civil War</i>.  Thank you for joining us today.</p>

<p><b>Rachel Shelden (RS):</b> Thanks so much for having me.</p>

<i><b><p> CWBR: </i></b> For starters, I'd like to know what first brought you to the topic?</p>

<p><b>RS:</b> Well it's a great question.  I started this project as my dissertation at the University of Virginia, and I had been interested in Washington politics for quite some time.  I had worked for the Library Congress before going to graduate school, and I was very interested in the way that people interacted in Washington, and the difference in the culture of Washington from the inside and Washington from the outside (having not grown up in Washington, I'm originally from Chicago).  So, that was something that really struck me while I was living there, and I was working on a history of the House of Representatives, and I noticed that this was something that was very big in the nineteenth century, this sort of culture of Washington, and this was something that I wanted to pursue long-term.  So although I actually came to the topic a little bit later in graduate school, it was something that was bubbling in my mind for a long time.</p>

<i><b><p> CWBR: </i></b> You say that this was a problem that was very big in the nineteenth century--I'm sure some people would say that it's a problem that hasn't gone away--so what were some of the challenges then, of exposing the nature of that disconnect, and sort of the true culture of Washington when you're talking about people who have a very vested interest in projecting a certain kind of image and a certain kind of rhetoric and representation, when perhaps there's something else beneath the surface.</p>

<p><b>RS:</b> I think that's something we've struggled with for a very long time.  As historians, we have a lot of faith in the documents that we work with, and we worked with the Congressional Globe, which is the official record of the U.S. Congress in the nineteenth century--for most of the nineteenth century.  We had great faith in the Congressional Globe to be able to tell us what was going on in Washington and the ways that politicians engaged in thinking about the major political issues of the period.  And there were no real indicators as to why the Congressional Globe wouldn't have given us a straightforward answer to the ways that people thought and the way they behaved.  But I discovered more and more as I was reading about the politicians and reading their letters and reading—particularly their letters back home to their families—that they didn't have much trust in the Congressional Globe to tell them what was really going on because they didn't pay much attention to the speeches in Washington.  So the more that I sort of peeled back the layers of the Congressional Globe, the more I could tell that it wasn't actually representative of what politicians thought in terms of getting policy forward in the process of politicking in the nineteenth century.  So, I think it's a challenge because, as we all know, as all historians deal with, our sources can only take us so far.  They are only a small portion of what exists out there in terms of what was actually going on.  I had to dig deep to find references, usually not long stories, to the kind of politicking that happened outside the halls of the capital, at places like boarding houses and dinners and parties, and meetings of various associations in Washington.  That was a challenge, but I could tell that something was really not quite right there.</p>

<i><b><p> CWBR: </i></b> So, really then, most of the political discussions that mattered the most in reality, you would say, were the ones that took place outside of the halls of Congress?</p>

<p><b>RS:</b> That mattered to policy making.  I would never say that the Congressional Globe was non-important in terms of understanding what was going in the rest of the country, because in a lot of ways, the Congressional Globe was very much representative of what constituents wanted to hear.  That’s who these people were talking to when they were speaking in the halls of Congress.  They wanted their constituents back in Massachusetts and South Carolina and Kentucky and Louisiana to actually hear what they wanted to hear.  It was not, however, representative of what was going on in terms of the actual politicking in Washington.</p>

<i><b><p> CWBR: </i></b> One thing that interests me about that point is this very conscious importance of rhetoric.  Especially as we approach the Civil War and rhetoric, especially secessionist rhetoric, becomes even more virulent, even more fiery, it's interesting then that perhaps a lot of those speakers didn't fully believe what they were saying, or is that an overstatement?</p>

<p><b>RS:</b> I think it's a little bit of an overstatement.  This all goes back, as many of these things do, to David Potter, and David Potter's famed article “The Historian's Use of Nationalism and Vice-Versa,” where he talks about these conflicting loyalties that a person might have.  Loyalty to state, loyalty to family, loyalty to nation, and I think it was possible for a lot of these men to say things about their views on slavery in particular, but also be friendly with people who disagreed with them.  In part because of the personal experience of living in Washington.  It was very hard, if you wanted to have any kind of political role in the city at this time, to avoid interacting with people who are going to have different opinions from you, and that was an acknowledged part of being there.  So you see, for example, slaveholders talking about how most Northerners are antislavery, and not liking those views, but being willing to work with it because they have this understanding that they have those views and those are the views of their constituents.  So I would never say, for example, that they don't really believe what they're saying.  They may say it a little bit more strongly, or in particularly fiery rhetoric to try to get their constituents fired up about the issue, but I would say that much of what happened was really in the context of ""We are politicians, that's what we do, and we all have a sense of what we want,"" which was to keep the Union together--most of the people wanted to keep the Union together--and to have a successful Federal government.  It didn't always work, but there was certainly a level of respect that existed among the politicians that didn't necessarily extend to the constituents.</p>

<i><b><p> CWBR: </i></b> That issue of respect sort of leads to another question, because it seems like the centerpiece of most narratives of Washington politics right before the Civil War was, of course, Preston Brooks caning Charles Sumner.  It's sort of the image that's been seared into every textbook.  And, a lot of scholars have established the importance of honor and personal politics.  But it seems like part of what you're saying is that this respect and sense of honor, in more cases, helped keep these people together and working together, rather than driving wedges between them.  So would you call instances of people like Preston Brooks more of the exception than the rule?</p>

<p><b>RS:</b> I wouldn't say that it was an exception in the sense that there was an incredible amount of violence in the nineteenth century, and especially in Washington, which was a pretty violent but also just a pretty dirty and disgusting city, which allowed for that kind of thing to happen.  This is part of what I tried to show in that chapter in particular and in my book, that if you understand the caning of Charles Sumner in the context of the violence that existed in Washington, it's not unusual.  What made it unusual is that it got the kind of press that it did, and it became such an incredible tool for people in the North and the South, in thinking about the problems of, say, a slave power, or of an oppressive North.  So, it's usual in the sense that there was quite a bit of violence.  It's unusual in the terms of political tools outside of Washington, but the people in Washington understood it as an example of violence, of things getting out of hand, and one that didn't necessarily mean that we were about to crumble into Civil War.</p>

<i><b><p> CWBR: </i></b> For the politicians that may have witnessed this, or heard about it, it was sort of disconnected from what the nation saw.  In a sense, the nation saw this as a much more important event than perhaps the people there at the scene did?</p>

<p><b>RS:</b> Exactly, it was a big event when it happened, and people were upset, but it went away after a couple days.  People sort of said, ""Ok, now we're going to get back to the business of making policy, and that involves talking to my Southern neighbors or my Northern neighbors, and I can't avoid that, nor should I.""  So it certainly was something that really energized people who weren't in Washington, but in Washington, it wasn't such a big deal.</p>

<i><b><p> CWBR: </i></b> One that you've mentioned several times that also sticks out to me is this sense of place, and you mentioned that because of the nature of Washington, that these people couldn't really avoid each other, even if they had wanted to.  I was hoping you could talk about the role of proximity, and how that affected politics, and also what were some of the places that politicians interacted outside of Congress?</p>

<p><b>RS:</b> I'm happy to.  I think one of the most fascinating aspects of Washington in this period is that there are sort of two Washingtons.  There's the permanent Washington.  There's the Washington that has the people that you would see in any city--in New York, in Charleston, etc.--where you're going to have workers, women, African Americans.  That absolutely existed in Washington, but there was also this more temporary part of Washington that really only existed between the Capital building and the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue, which is not a very large area.  In that area, you had mostly male politicians living in boarding houses, also some hotels.  They spent almost all of their time together.  They were either in the Capital or they were at home, or they were at dinners or gambling houses--maybe some brothels also--in that area.  So they actually spent most of their time together, and what this produced was something of a fraternity.  You might think about it as a giant male bonding session, where you have these men who spend all their time together, not so much with women, and where they're really engaging in conversation in places outside the Capital.  That includes things like dinners.  Lots of people held dinners for their friends.  This would happen, some, with the permanent politicians.  William Corcoran, who was a famous socialite in the period, would host regular political dinners, and he lived right by the White House so you would see, basically, a revolving door of politicians coming to eat with him, but also just people sitting down to have dinner at the end of the day.  There were various boarding houses.  You also had people going to church together.  You had people meeting at Masonic groups, and also other smaller groups that they put together.  One really famous example of this was Abraham Lincoln, who was in a group called the Young Indian Club, which was sort of a political debating group that consisted of himself, one other Northerner, and five Southerners including future Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens, which made for some really interesting commentary on Lincoln's behalf.  But the two of them became quite friendly in this group and talked politics and this had a real influence, I believe, on Lincoln's thinking on politics in Washington, and particularly the secession crisis.  Thinking about what was possible, the kinds of compromises that could happen, and the way in which you could have a conversation with someone from the South, and not have it lead to Civil War.  So there was a lot discussion that happened outside of the Capital building in these more informal circumstances, but with the same group of people.</p>

<i><b><p> CWBR: </i></b> Would you say that Lincoln's experience in Washington was initially what made him optimistic that war could be avoided?</p>

<p><b>RS:</b> I do think so.  I think he was affected by his time in Washington in a variety of ways, and I point this out in a couple of places in the book.  One of things that was really important to him in terms of his experience in Washington and being in this Young Indian Club was to expose him to John Crittenden, who was very famous politician from Kentucky, someone that he admired very much.  Crittenden was life-long politician, had spent many years in Washington, and Crittenden himself became quite friendly with Stephen Douglas, Lincoln's main rival in Illinois in the 1858 Senate campaign, and Douglas is very happy to get Crittenden's endorsement in 1858, and this had a very big impact on Lincoln's experiences in thinking about who should be in his cabinet once he's elected in 1860.  I believe he never forgave John Crittenden for his behavior in supporting Stephen Douglas.  But it also gave him a sense of this Washington club, and what was possible in Washington.  I think he really underestimated how much secession was going to be a grassroots movement that did not have any kind of real push in Washington.  It was much more a rejection of Washington politicians, and so he misread the South.  He had a misunderstanding of what was actually going to happen when he made his original decision to not speak out, to not say anything, to not support the attempts in Congress to try to come up with a solution--the Crittenden Compromise--again, his anger at Crittenden is something that I think we really underestimate.  In spite of that, Lincoln was smart man, he figured things out, and a lot of historians have shown his thinking in March and April to be quite different, but early on in the process, I think he had a great misunderstanding of what was going to happen.</p>

<i><b><p> CWBR: </i></b> Do you think that this club should be viewed more in the light of having been able, for a long time and with some notable instances of compromise, that they were able for so long to smooth over differences and prevent war from breaking out, or is this more a story of these guys in this ""Washington bubble"" disconnected from what the issues of the war and secession were going to be, really ultimately being unable to prevent something that they didn't really understand?</p>

<p><b>RS:</b> That's an excellent question.  I think what I've tried to do and the historians who read this will recognize this, is sort of turn the old revisionist theory on its head.  So the old revisionist theory being that a blundering generation of politicians pushed toward war because they had a misunderstanding of how serious these things were, and they were particularly fiery, and they ended up pushing us into war; it's their fault.  My point here is to show, to a large degree, that they didn't really have control.  They were not the ones that could have made decisions about this, and they did live in a bubble that made them really unable to understand a lot of what was going on at home.  Jefferson Davis being the best example of this.  He's quite sad when secession comes, and he's sad, in part I think because he didn't realize how serious it was.  In large part because he was so sad that the Union was falling apart, but also because he didn't understand how this could happen so quickly; he was very surprised by it.  I would say that my point is much more that they didn't have the tools to fix this problem.  The movement toward secession was really a rejection of <i>them</i>, and a rejection of their way of handling politics.  You read the letters during the secession crisis, and so much of what they say is ""these corrupt officials in Washington, they've failed us, over and over and over again, so we need to take matters into our own hands.""  So I think the secession crisis is much more about that, it's not so much about the blundering politicians.  Of course they contribute, because they make all these fiery speeches, but they didn't really have it in their power to fix the situation. </p>

<p><b><i>Civil War Book Review (CWBR)</i></b>: Today the Civil War Book Review is happy to speak with Ira Berlin, Distinguished Professor of History at the University of Maryland.  Professor Berlin previously authored, <i>Slaves Without Masters: The Free Negro in the Antebellum South</i>; <i>Generations of Captivity: A History of Slaves in the United States</i>; as well as <i>Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in Mainland North America</i>.  Today we get to talk about his most recent book, <i>The Long Emancipation: The Demise of slavery in the United States</i>.  Professor Berlin, thank you for chatting with us today.</p>

<p><b>Ira Berlin (IB)</b>: I'm delighted to be joining you.</p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: Readers familiar with your previous works will find this book a natural fit, but I still want to start out by asking what drew you to this project, and how you decided to approach it?</p>

<p><b>IB</b>: Several things specifically drew me to this project, like most history it's about arguments and I found myself in arguments.  First most unfortunately for me, with Steven Spielberg who of course had millions of viewers of what I found is a really wonderful movie, in the technical sense, that his movie, <i>Lincoln</i>, where he focuses on one event and sees this as critical to emancipation and while this made great theatre I felt it made very bad history.  So that started me off. And then I read an essay by a Portuguese scholar, Joao Marques, who made the case that the prime cause of abolition could be found not in the quarters of slaves, but in the drawing rooms of white Europeans and Anglo-Americans.  And that I found even more appalling since it was a historians take on things.  And Marques’ essay was surrounded by commentary by other historians, many of whom I had great respect for, who seemed to go along with Marques. So eventually I felt I had to answer this and I had the opportunity to do that in the Nathan I. Huggins lectures at Harvard.  That I felt was kind of an interesting exercise because I wrote what I had to say, and then I had to kind of deflate it into bite-size lectures since apparently nobody can sit still for more than a half an hour or so.  Then I was told that Harvard wanted to pump it up to a book, so what I deflated had to be pumped up as well.  So what you have in <i>The Long Emancipation</i> is something which has a long tale. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: I'm interested in your take on the recent historiography or maybe it's presence in the wider public because it is very clear that though there might be good scholarship out there, it doesn't really seem to compete with voices like <i>Lincoln</i>, which you mentioned.  So part of what your addressing here is—would it be safe to call—that these things like <i>Lincoln</i> create a “great man” history of emancipation, and why is that type of approach problematic when we're talking about slavery and emancipation? </p>

<p><b>IB</b>: I think it's always problematic.  These two genres of the cinema and the book are just so radically different.  The cinema focuses on a moment, and it brings to bear on that moment enormous visibility by great actors, people who if they were reading the telephone book would make us pay attention.  But if we take a look at the text that they have and take a look at the screen play I'm always amazed by how few words are actually involved.  On the other hand our work is the work of words and there are lots of words and words give us a way of telling not a moment but a longer story.   Much more detail to talk about nuance, to talk about contradictions and the like.  So I think there are probably always going to be some natural conflicts.  On this one of course, as Spielberg rightly understood, he was coming into a great buzzsaw of conflict that Americans have had for a long, long time over the question of who freed the slaves.  A conflict which is larded with ideas about how history progresses, larded by racial divisions and so on and so forth. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: So slavery dies as a result of a process, not an act.  But I was impressed with how, while keeping sight of all these nuances that you mention, the larger context never really escapes.  And how do you manage to balance that?  You made this project quite a bit smaller and then you had to make it larger again but it's still not a tremendously large book and you've managed to walk a line there that it seems that perhaps in film people have been unable to do.</p>

<p><b>IB</b>: I think it's also very difficult to do in writing history.  It's always easier to write long than to write short. I tell that to my students when I assign a ten page paper and they're utterly appalled at the prospect of writing ten pages.  I say if I was <i>really</i> going to punish you I'd assign a one page paper and demand that you stay within those bounds.  I think the answer is to have some kind of more general framework that you're writing in.  That enables you to define and to stay within those bounds.  The question that seem to appeal to me in speaking both at the lectures and then writing the book, was to say if we're going to conceive of emancipation as a near hundred-year event between the Revolution and the 13th Amendment, than what are the defining markers, the defining ideas which always shape emancipation during these years? I think once I defined those and went back and forth in my mind of were there three, or were there five, and so on?  Once I defined those then in some ways the job became a lot simpler.  It was how as you cut into this long history of emancipation—this near 100-year history—did you find black people in positions of leadership or centrality.  Once you raise the question of emancipation the question of exactly what the status of the slave was going to be once freedom came and you go on down the list and look at each of those subjects at various critical points in the near hundred years. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: When I was struck by how often in this sort of longer view there are these critical points where not only does the [theatrical], more popular focus on white abolitionist allies—really they're not there—but they <i>couldn't</i> be there because the moment wasn't right.  And of course you note that white abolitionist allies helped, they were important, they certainly hastened slavery's end, but they were often divided and struggled to maintain focus on slaves and equality.  Why do you think they were so much more divided than the people of the center of all this? </p>

<p><b>IB</b>: I would put the question the other way, why were black people so focused?  And I think the answer is, for them this was always going to be a central question.  A question that could not be compromised.  For whites, perhaps all but a few like Garrison who maybe understood better as a surrogate black man, but for all but a few whites you can imagine a compromise, you can imagine all of those compromises that are continually pushed forward from the gradual post-nati abolition to colonization, to the endless other forms of gradualism which white abolitionists are willing to accept, but are clearly just out of the question for black people.  And of course they were right of everything that we know about gradualism is that it extends and extends and extends and certainly would have extended the emancipation period well into the twentieth Century given the power of the slave holding class and their ability to use the courts and to delay and the legislatures and delay in various ways.</p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: Well that's what was interesting to me is that slavery's white defenders did not seem at all beset by the same level of disorganization that it's white detractors experienced. </p>

<p><b>IB</b>: I think that's true. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: But then of course black communities both slave and free, it's very remarkable how organized they were especially considering the barriers that they faced.  You mentioned shifting histories, I think you called it, and justifications for slavery. How do you think those fostered solidarity within these two opposing forces while the folks that we often focus on were sort of vacillating in the middle?</p>

<p><b>IB</b>: Well this is a long period played out over not simply a continent but the larger Atlantic world of people who are often living apart and barely connected by newspapers and other epistolary connections.  Not really until the end of the period, do we have telegraphs and other forms of communication which move information.  So it seems to me that it's only natural that these kinds of differences take a variety of regional forms within the anti-slavery community.  There's a Philadelphia community, and a Boston community, a Chicago community and people who are slugging it out still in various places in southern Illinois and along the various other borderlands.  It seems to me that we're always going to have those kinds of differences and part of them can be accounted for the structure of information flow.  But beyond that there are real differences that emerge once a proposal is put on the table and then the implications of that have to be sorted out.</p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: I want to get into some of the details, for one you mentioned, regional variations and it was fascinating to read of the specific challenges that communities faced perhaps in the borderlands—that is free black communities—faced in the borderlands versus places in the North or even southern cities.  And it was surprising, I think a lot of the assumptions readers might have, such as that unilaterally things would be easier in the North did not always hold true.  I was wondering if you could just talk about some of the variations that you did run into taking this longer view?</p>

<p><b>IB</b>: Of course a central variation if we're going to look at free blacks as a critical agent in the emancipatory process, is North and South.  The simple fact is that if you lived in the South the chances of prosperity were perhaps greater than in the North, where labor was valued and denied to black people, whereas labor in the South was defined as negro work, and you could actually make a considerable amount of money.  But you were deprived of all those kinds of rights of citizens and political rights whereas in the North, largely impoverished black communities could petition, could protest, could march, could publish newspapers and pamphlets and the like.  So you have this one fundamental difference, and then of course you have differences that grow out <i>within</i> the North which grow out of very different kind of experiences.  The New England one clearly one where free blacks have a much longer tradition of political and social rights.  They have created a public sphere, which is much more fragile in the middle states, and of course in the western states or what was then called the old Northwest, is more fragile still because slavery hangs on for so much longer, well into the 1830s and ‘40s.  It's a viable institution despite the Northwest Ordinance, kept alive through various surrogate forms.</p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: And then of course it's not just the free black communities that are assaulting slavery and eroding slavery with their organizations outside of the slave system, there's also the slaves themselves.  I think a lot of readers are probably familiar with some of the ways that slaves could resist slavery such as breaking tools or, obviously, escaping but what are some of the strategies over this long period of time that slaves used that historians have been slower to integrate into the narrative of slavery's slow demise?</p>

<p><b>IB</b>: I think the crucial one is, the one which is central and which can't be emphasized enough, is how these various forms of resistance played out within a northern public, within a white northern public.  Some of these are simple fact that if there was no resistance then the assumption that slaveholders projected about slavery, that slaves were happy, than had to have certain relevance and certain truth.  So that there <i>was</i> resistance, the first thing, contradicted that truth.  A second thing which I think is really crucial is that a substantial portion of the northern free black population carried the heritage of slavery into the North, meaning that runaways, the first generation of people who were free who say enter the North in the third decade of the nineteenth century, who are going to have children who are a first generation of born free in the North.  And all of them carry the experience of slavery, so the direct experience of slavery is there in the North and it has enormous power.  It's not simply these matters of running away or breaking tools or setting fire to the barn or pissing in the soup or however we want to define various kinds of resistance, it's the <i>active</i> presence of slavery and hence the people who cannot forget the elemental violence of human rights that slavery does.  What it takes away from people, the physical marks it leaves on people and so on.  All of these can be mobilized as the Civil War comes closer, whether it's in resistance to the fugitive slave law or whether it's the kinds of mobilization that will come with the creation of militias in that last decade before the war. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: Well even once the war begins, that was one of my favorite sections of how that process from the beginning of the war through 1863 or so became a microcosm for the longer process because it really wasn't just the act of enlisting black soldiers, it was this slow realization that the northern white soldiers and their officers had because of sudden exposure to slavery and contact with former slaves right?</p>

<p><b>IB</b>: That's absolutely correct.  Again once we've established these four events or four processes that we’ve seen played out during the American Revolution and then we’ve seen played out during the struggle for emancipation in the North and that we’ve seen played out in the various post-Garrisonian struggles, we see that played out again in the years between 1861 and 1865.  Which I think is what gives it a kind of validity at least in my own mind.</p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: Another theme or dynamic rather that struck me was how time and time again we see in this book tremendous efforts that black communities and leaders had to maintain, at great risk, just to loosen the stranglehold of slavery.  And that always was a major contrast with the relative ease, over most of this period, with which slavery supporters could assault black rights or increase violence with really just the stroke of a pen with things like the Fugitive Slave Act.  And we often talk about slavery[‘s end] as being either ""from the bottom-up"" or ""top-down,"" but this story to me really seemed to come out almost as a history of ""bottom-up"" vs. ""top down.""  Would that be a fair characterization? </p>

<p><b>IB</b>: I would think that that would be a fair characterization.  It strikes me that one of the things the anti-slavery movement is, and makes it so relevant, makes it such a powerful force it really is <i>the</i> model for movement for social liberation.  Everything from Jeffersonian democracy to gay rights, and often movements which seem to be in contradiction to each other like pro-choice and pro-life.  Again and again they adopt the ideals of the abolition movement, the rhetoric of the abolition movement, the modes of organization, their tactics, their strategies so that antislavery always seems to have great relevance for us as Americans and I think other social liberation movements around the world.</p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: These major themes that you highlight---black agency in demanding freedom, black agency in defining that freedom, and the citizenship, demanding equality and of course the violence that had to accompany all these processes.  These are far from finished playing out by 1865, and I was just wondering how do you decide where, if not this story, where this book has to end? Were you tempted to press this narrative into Reconstruction beyond? </p>

<p><b>IB</b>: There’s always that temptation because so much of Reconstruction is a playing out of the slave experience in various ways.  But emancipation, the 13th Amendment, the end of slavery is a sharp breaking point at least for me, and I think for most slaves.  They understood these former slaves, these freed people, they understood of course that they were not free as they would like to be.  They understood that they did not have the rights of white people and they would not be given the rights of white people despite the Civil War amendments.  But they understood also that things had changed in a dramatic way.  They could live and sleep in the same house as their children and had responsibility for their parents, they could no longer be driven as with an overseer, they would, by right, work for wages and be able to keep those wages and invest them as they wished, they could become property owners.  All of these things were radically different than being a piece of property yourself.  So I always think that emancipation is a place where we have to recalibrate and reload and rethink the experience of both the black and white in a slave society.</p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: Another good reason to focus on the people actually experiencing this then. </p>

<p><strong><i>Civil War Book Review (CWBR)</i></strong>: Today the Civil War Book Review is happy to speak with James L. Huston, Regents Professor of History at Oklahoma State University.  Professor Huston previously authored, among several books, <i>Calculating the Value of the Union: Slavery, Property Rights, and the Coming of the Civil War</i>, as well as <i>Stephen A. Douglas and the Dilemma of Democratic Equality</i>.  Today we get to talk about his most recent book, <i>The British Gentry, the Southern Planter, and the Northern Family Farmer: Agriculture and Sectional Antagonism in North America</i>.  Professor Huston, thank you for joining us today. </p>

<p><strong>James L. Huston (JH)</strong>: My pleasure, and thank you for the invitation. </p>

<p><strong><i>CWBR</i></strong>: So I'll get right into it because there's quite a bit going on in this book.  You're taking on a lot of long established narratives: an industrialized North growing apart from an Agrarian South; capitalist development in the North growing antagonistic to the outmoded southern economic model; a matter of free labor versus slavery; but you argue that all of these are incomplete explanations at best for sectional antagonism.  So instead, the source of sectional antagonism lies in agriculture?</p>

<p><strong>JH</strong>: That is the thesis of the book and it is there because of landholding patterns.  Small farms in the North and large estates in the South, and that particular antagonism is, I think very evident in Europe, and the transference to North America demonstrates how the large landholders and the small landholders have a continuous battle going on.  Now just as an aside—the industrialized North growing apart from agrarian South—let me just add to that by saying, it is growing apart in certain ways of mechanization and perhaps some social relations and what have you.  But even John C. Calhoun recognized by 1848 or 1849 that the Northern industry was complimentary to Southern agriculture.  They weren't in competition.  That's part of the problem with that model.  Where is the competition between the two?  They actually kind of work together.  As for the matter of labor relations, I have long argued that slavery was a threat to all kinds whatever kind of free labor was going on in the North.  It's just that it seems to me that so much of the literature has focused on wage labor in cities and has not looked at the way that wage labor was operating in the countryside.  At any event, from the way I set it up, and looked at the landholding patterns, there is a moment of explicit collision and that is 1854 with the Kansas-Nebraska Act.</p>

<p><strong><i>CWBR</i></strong>: So it's not necessarily that there is no tension in the economic systems or in the labor but that, that tension doesn't originate with the labor, it doesn't originate with the economic systems, it all comes down to the landholding patterns? </p>

<p><strong>JH</strong>: Yes I would argue that.  The landholding patterns actually spin off different ideological formulations, different understandings of the way you work with other people, a different—actually a sense of mastery.  The large landholder is going to have a sense of mastery over others, whereas in the small farm environment, you have to master yourself in order to make the family farm operate.  When you get a collision, the collision is going to be that the large operators are going to have this sense of mastery over others and it's going to get picked up.  That's how I look at it. </p>

<p><strong><i>CWBR</i></strong>: So towards the beginning of the book, it's not unusual for books talking about sectional antagonism to go well back into the Antebellum period, but you go back a little further you take readers clear back as far as 1066, on a another continent.  When you were starting out did you have an idea that this research was going to take you that far back, or was that somewhat surprising? </p>

<p><strong>JH</strong>: It was a total surprise.  I expected to go to 1840 and stay in the United States.  But the question arose who were yeoman?  What was involved?  All I had was the background notion that most of us gain going to grad school.  And so I got out Wallace Notestein, New American Nation series, out in 1960, <i>The English People on the Eve of Colonization</i>, and there it had a section on yeoman but also on farm labor, which was originally in <i>The English People on the Eve of Colonization</i> wage labor, and that just struck a bell right there so I just pursued it.  I kept trying to find yeoman in England and I ultimately came to the opinion that they were sort of a mystical beast.  I have to say 1066 to about 1450 was just a mess in terms of manors and land distribution patterns and the type of land tenure systems they had.  But probably about 1500-1550 it develops into the large estates, tenant farms, and massive agricultural labors, and that's the contrast either I had forgotten about or I was ignorant of, but that's the contrast that then plays a major role in my understanding of how agriculture in North America develops.  You know I have to say it was a lot of fun.  I really enjoyed getting out of the United States and going into agricultural development in parts of Europe and particularly in Great Britain.  But yeah it was a total surprise.  I didn’t expect to be doing this at all. </p>

<p><strong><i>CWBR</i></strong>: I was also surprised by how significant, in Northern agriculture, the early experiments by the Puritans were to this whole thing.  I expected ok, a book on agriculture, it's going to be looking very heavily at plantations and slavery and the sort of the expected set of elements, but with going to Europe and then looking at that transference to North America it seems that you sort of revived a little bit of the centrality to that Puritan experiment in the overall narrative. </p>

<p><strong>JH</strong>: Which also was a bit of a surprise, but I had to figure out why the estate system of English agriculture did not grow in the northern states, and northern colonies.  I ultimately came to conclusion that they just couldn't transfer a good, cheap labor source.  The tenant labor for example on the Van Rensselaer Estates and the patroons on the Hudson River could not generate the income necessary to live like a true English high gentry aristocrat.  Thus if you wanted to make money you went to the city.  That meant that the people who were willing to put in the work on a small farm were going to be able to get a farm, which is very different from what happened in England.  I had to work somehow to explain that really gross deviation, where in the Southern states because of an early discovery of tobacco, later on rice and then cotton, they found sort of a monopoly crop that could sustain large landholdings if they got a cheap source of labor, and that was slavery. </p>

<p><strong><i>CWBR</i></strong>: When with the lack of cheap labor in the North I found it very interesting that yes, in order to achieve a certain standard of living Northerners may have been drawn to the cities, but their savings rates really seemed to upset assertions that later, free labor is all about basically forcing labor into the lowest possible wages, sort of imposing top-down capitalism on Northern farmers.  Because not only are these Northern farmers—they seem far more agrarian than their Southern counterparts— but also they don't really even seem that poor. </p>

<p><strong>JH</strong>: I did the best I could with the numbers I could get from [Jeremy] Atack and [Fred] Bateman, <i>To Their Own Soil</i>, which gives income in the various states, approximately the average, and working that out on a family basis.  I put it between about $800-$1000 a year, that's income of course.  That's not profit, that's income.  So I guess on average some of these farmers are probably saving maybe $100 maybe $150-$200 a year.  Those are a little bit guesses.  I have to say that some questions of just important numbers that you would want to have, not really existing in the literature.  So I took some leaps of faith, just to get it out as to what kind of income would indicate what kind of standard living.  The way it sort of shook out is the northern farmer, the average northern farmer, is probably would be what we call a lower-middle class position.  Maybe to a middle class position, in income.  Soon as you hit the word “class” you're getting into a whole other realm of behaviors and manual labor versus mental labor versus leisure and things like that.  But just in terms of income, they are considerably above subsistence, they're nowhere near luxury.  Does that answer your question? </p>

<p><strong><i>CWBR</i></strong>: Yes, yes.  And then to push a little further, despite the fact that much is made of the larger cities being in the North, how is it that these smaller farms, very small farms compared to the Southern plantations, were the backbone of those larger Northern cities? </p>

<p><strong>JH</strong>: First off the question of Northern cities the first thing I would probably say is that Northern cities develop because of trans-Atlantic trade.  It's the Boston merchants, the New York merchants are involved in the cotton trade, the rice trade with the West Indies, with China.  They're making money that's outside the sphere of agriculture <i>except</i> to the point of local farms near the cities, there you're going to get an exchange.  When you get closer into the two decades prior to the Civil War than you get the railroads and the great grain trade and the Great Lakes and the canal trade.  Then it's a question of rural areas supplying the urban areas with food which becomes, actually, a great economic locomotive for decades, if not a century.  Why the cities grow though is not necessarily connected to Northern farms.  People gravitate to cities, some of which because they don't like farm work—Horace Greeley being a good example, actually a whole bunch of Republican leaders— </p>

<p><strong><i>CWBR</i></strong>: Abe Lincoln as well right? </p>

<p><strong>JH</strong>: Well it's a lot of work and you know not everybody wants to put in that much effort just to get a competence.  So why Northern cities kept growing, you're not going to find a lot of answers out of rural America.  Rural America, rural Northern society rather, produces small towns because a small farmer cannot keep a small farm going without artisan/craftsmen help.  You have to have blacksmiths, carpenters, shoemakers (bootmakers in particular).  You have to have carriage makers.  There’s a host of craft disciplines that small farmers need.  I ran into a number of times these family farmers were trying to repair their wagons or their carriages or whatever, and all they did was hurt themselves.  So the small family farms needed to be serviced and that's where you get the small towns.  As it becomes more commercial then these small towns start to need some credit facilities and merchants who are making long distant travels, gives rise to the regional city, and as commerce further develops, they get attached then to the core cities: New York, Boston, Philadelphia later on Cleveland, Chicago probably.  To contract this quickly, I don't know why the great cities grew great.  My real answer probably would be, and it’s not in the book, its immigration.  European immigrants are the ones who flood to the cities. </p>

<p><strong><i>CWBR</i></strong>: But what this does suggest is that those small towns are really important to that network and that's major point of divergence from the plantation complex. </p>

<p><strong>JH</strong>: Oh yes, that's right.  Actually the point I make about the plantation is the comparison between a free society, as it turns out northern agricultural society, and the plantation is the difference between the town setting in the north and the slave community.  Because the slave community on the large plantations is actually the reflection of the artisanal needs of the agricultural community in the south.  That's where you have the slave artisans and the difference in housing, standard living, and everything else is reflected in the difference between the small northern town and the slave community. </p>

<p><strong><i>CWBR</i></strong>: And the effect that the plantations have on populations in the South, I thought was particularly fascinating that yes, the plantations are engines to some extent for westward migration, but not because these plantations are simply using up soil and then moving westward.  It's because they're engrossing their landholding and pushing people westward. </p>

<p><strong>JH</strong>: I think yes they are pushing some people out.  It's a long term process, it was a long term process in England, and I think the parallel works.  The problem is the sons and the daughters of small farmers.  Where they going to get the land to have their small farm?  The northern farms of the states that compose the Union in 1850, was about 880,000 I think.  It's going to grow in the same states to over about 2.1 million in 1900-1910.  They're still multiplying small farms up there, but in the southern states where you have the plantations of thousands and thousands of acres, you're not going to have the spare land for extra small farms, and I think that’s the crisis the yeoman were facing in the South.  The plantation was undercutting the yeoman's society in the South. </p>

<p><strong><i>CWBR</i></strong>: I also want to talk about the plantation's ability to exert that kind of influence as it seems to me essentially a very capitalist enterprise.  I mean this requires capital to make one large and then it sort of seems to create an advantage that just keeps regenerating, they have the capital to invest in more land, to invest in more technology... </p>

<p><strong>JH</strong>: The plantations were making large amounts of money.  They were investing that money either in land acquisition or in more slaves.  You know, compared to the English example, the English had to use a lot of manures and a lot of fertilizer in order to continue to be productive and to be successful in terms of money income.  Southern planters used, as far as I can tell, quite a bit of fertilizer.  The difference is though, if necessity arose, they can move West.  I mean they weren't cut off.  If they were cut off I think they would have made the switch to invest it in manures, fertilizing, something to maintain their operations.  I don't think that westward expansion was a life-or-death kind of situation for them.  Now I have to say that the financial statements of the plantation where they're investing their money in everything, I'm not altogether—I don't have a balance sheet for them.  I don't know very many who actually do now that I think about it.  They were generating a large amount of income, and the great planters were living close to the style of the gentry who were making about—they had 1000 acres or 10,000 acres which was considered high gentry in England. </p>

<p><strong><i>CWBR</i></strong>: There was some evidence that you found in Virginia that I thought was really interesting about just how adaptable the plantation system may have actually been even if it's a small study. </p>

<p><strong>JH</strong>: OK first point, the plantation turns out to be adaptable because it's big.  That's a point I got to that everybody emphasizes the number of slaves, I emphasized the number of acres <i>and</i> slaves.  With a large landholding you can do some more systematic, efficient exercises than you can on a small farm.  Now the second part on wheat is I had read Irwin's article, I think in the <i>Journal of Economic History</i>, I'm not sure where, on slavery and wheat growing in the Shenandoah, on the Piedmont.  I thought that's good you know it's interesting, economic questions, economy of scale, and how did the wheat farmers (slave owners) make slavery pay in wheat farming.  I had no idea it was very extensive.  I was invited by Gary Gallagher to give a talk to a small group in Charlottesville some years back and, I think it was Edward Ayers, hit me with slave plantations producing <i>enormous</i> amounts of wheat.  Well I just sort of tucked that one away.  Then when I went to the University of Virginia library and then to the Virginia Historical Society, and I finally looked at some of these collections of wheat growers, and northern farmers [were producing], what 50 bushels, 100 bushels, and these guys [southern planters] were producing 5,000, 6,000, and in one of the magazines of southern agriculture somebody was producing 10,000 bushels of wheat.  That's enormous!  That’s an <i>enourmous</i> output.  That puts them right up there with some of the good sized English estates and by the way, the English Estates were growing wheat and they were doing it with cheap labor.  There's no reason why I personally think the slave plantation could not have been adapted to other kinds of crop, and the reason is because on a large plantation you can get specialization of labor.  Certain people do certain things all the time, be the plowmen, be the ditchers, and have some carpenters, some people be dray people, transportation workers.  You make occupations that are very specialized and you get a certain economic efficiency from that.  Then there is the economies of scale from what [Robert] Fogel and [Stanley] Engerman call mass productions in the fields. That’s a point of some controversy, but compared to a family farmer who has to do everything on his own, has to stop doing some things to do something else, has got a multiple number of jobs, the comparison is pretty obvious.  The northern family farmer is a jack of all trades.  You’ve got to do everything.  He and either a couple sons or a hired hand to help him, they're doing everything.  And you don't get any division of labor, you don't get any repetitive motion activity in the fields like you do in slavery.  I think that was probably transferrable.  The old explanation is that, wheat is what, a four month crop whereas cotton is what, ten month crop, that it's the length of the growing season necessary which made slavery work for cotton but not for wheat.  I think that given the size of the plantation, growing different crops, a little rational management, and from what I can tell from the account books, the large planters were very rational people.  They kept a tight control on what was going on their plantation.  I don't see why they could not have gone into these other activities if cotton prices started to falter, if they had to make a switch to something else to keep their plantations going, or to move into other areas, like Kansas. </p>

<p><strong><i>CWBR</i></strong>: Well let’s talk about that, because despite how divergent these are—the system that creates self-mastery versus a system that's predicated on mastery of others—they coexist for a very long time, and its territorial expansion that actually brings them into competition, and then that's when you argue that one to has to come out on top.  I was wondering how does it work, that you called the plantation complex, basically that they're warring on small farmers? </p>

<p><strong>JH</strong>: I'm going to refine your statement a little bit, which is whether the plantation complex had to expand economically or not is one question.  The political leaders thought it did.  Maybe for economic reasons, maybe for political reasons in order to keep the Senate equal between the free and slave states.  It is the <i>political</i> decision to repeal the Missouri Compromise.  That is the kicker, because those were the areas reserved for the sons and daughters of northern family farmers.  That's how they're [rural northerners] looking at this.  It’s their patrimony.  It belongs to them.  If you want a blundering generation, I would say that's it.  The logic of my argument forces me to concede that if they would have drawn the 36 degree 30 minute line through to the Pacific Ocean, that they might have avoided a sectional split.  Because the migration tends to go in a directly west pattern and not a north-south pattern, and it was likely that if the southerners kept beneath that line and northerners kept above it, then the two systems were not going to get entangled.  But as soon as the political leadership of the South declared we have to repeal that line for what, reasons of honor, reasons of constitutional equality, for possible expansion, whatever.  That's what ignites the northern agricultural districts.  By the way my last table, where I chart out how the agricultural congressional districts are voting from 1842 to 1860, I added that in the last two weeks of writing this book.  I had made the division, I had listed all these congressional districts, and I said well nobody can make of this, I can't make sense of this.  So then I collapsed it to see the pattern and actually I went back and added 1842-1851, and the northern farming congressional districts were voting democrat continuously, even through the Wilmot Proviso California controversy—</p>

<p><strong><i>CWBR</i></strong>: They're actually the strongest voting block at one point aren't they? </p>

<p><strong>JH</strong>: Yes by a substantial majority, and then you hit 1854 and it's just the death knell of the Democrats in the northern agricultural congressional districts.  That was the point at which I said ok, there’s an economic basis to this political realignment.  It was not necessarily a signal that a war is forthcoming, it was not necessarily a signal that maybe expansion into Mexico would be opposed.  That's conjecture, but it is a statement, “a plantation will not go about 36 degrees 30 minutes.”  That will not be permitted, and then southern political leaders read it as well, “this is a war on our institution,” the Republican Party that grows out of it.  So some of it I would say, there is some misreading going on.  Southerners are hypercritical, hypersensitive to anything that suggests that slavery will not be considered an equivalent economic interest in the Union, whereas most northerners <i>distinctly</i> have the realization that the plantation creates a different type of society, one that is hostile to the small farm.  And they're not going to allow it to go above 36 degrees 30 minutes.  </p>

<p><strong><i>CWBR</i></strong>:  We often like to interpret the Civil War as a catalyst for tremendous change, but when we start talking about the landholding patterns rather than the labor on them specifically, it seems to call a little bit [of that change] into question.  Did the war really change this fundamental agricultural antagonism? </p>

<p><strong>JH</strong>: As far as northern agriculture is concerned, at least by the numbers, it continues on a trajectory of small farms, at least in the states that constituted the Union in 1860, the northern states.  When we get to the southern states, the plantation system is gone, but actually the landholding system—the people who owned the land continued to own the land.  That's the part, Johnathan Wiener in 1978, <i>Social Origins of the New South</i>, I remember insisted that in Mississippi and Alabama the landholding pattern remained the same.  I think David Wright says the same, but what’s the index here, what are the actual numbers?  Sharecropping, when it comes about, makes the comparison between northern and southern agriculture really difficult.  Southern agriculture obviously undergoes a major transformation, in terms of the labor supply and what happens to African Americans.  The North just preserves it's family farm, rural village setting, right up virtually into the 1950s.  Actually in a way, I guess I edited this out, but farms now have grown big and they're now containing thousands of [formerly independent] farms.  Even the old family farm is being incorporated so they can escape estate taxes and things like that.  But at the same time we’re seeing, in almost every state, the small towns disappearing, drying up and dying.  I would say the reason for that is because the size of the farm has changed.  When the family farm was 100 acres, 160 acres, you got the small rural villages and towns, but when your farms are thousands of acres, it squeezes those towns out of existence.  That's what's happened in western Oklahoma, western Kansas, western Nebraska, actually western New York is facing the same thing.  And I would say the major part of it is the difference in the size of farms. </p>

<p><strong><i>CWBR</i></strong>:  Well Professor Huston, there’s a lot more I wish we had time to talk about, certainly.  I appreciate you taking he time to discuss with us your most recent work, carefully researched, and a great read.  The book is the <i>British Gentry, the Southern Planter, and the Northern Family Farmer: Agriculture and Sectional Antagonism in North America</i>. </p>

<i><b><p>Civil War Book Review (CWBR):</i></b> Today, I’m discussing with Professor James Oakes his new published <i>Freedom National: The Destruction of slavery in the United States, 1861-1865</i>, which was recently awarded the 2013 Gilder Lehrman Lincoln Prize.  Congratulations Dr. Oakes and thank you for joining us today.</p>
<p>
<b>James Oakes (JO):</b>  Thank you very much. It's a pleasure to be here.</p>
<p>
<i><b>CWBR: </i></b>   You review in your book the drive of Republicans to make freedom national since the 1830s.  How did the Republican Party find such a level of freedom in the Constitution when the Democrats did not?</p>
<p>
<b>JO:</b>  Well, that's a long and complicated question.  They went back to the records of the Constitutional Convention and to the records of the founding era and discovered to their own satisfaction.  They were satisfied to discover that the founders had left an anti-slavery legacy that was more powerful than most contemporary historians actually believe was there and also that one wing of the anti-slavery movement, the Garisonian wing, belief was there specifically they saw in the language of the Constitution the repeated reference to slaves as persons rather than property and from that they deduced that the Constitution did not recognize slaves as property from the anti-slavery rulings of English courts that were extremely influential in revolutionary America.  They deduced that slavery could only be created by statutory or positive laws they called it and that in the absence of such statutory the universal presumption of the natural law was freedom since slavery was strictly a state institution.  It could not exist anywhere outside the boundaries of a state that had slave codes on its books and created slavery by positive law this would have been true in all of the northern states.  But, it was also true in all of the western territories and any areas where the Constitution itself was sovereign. There was positive law recognizing the existence of slavery again that meant not only the northern states that had abolished slavery but also the high seas, Washington D.C., the western territories.  And, if properly followed that constitutional logic would lead to a series of policies that would as you put it and I put it in my book make freedom national and slavery merely local, a state institution, on the assumption that slavery was a weak and inefficient and backwards institution.  The republicans, or antislavery people, assumed that once these policies were implemented the slave South was surrounded, not allowed to expand, no more new slave states, abolished in Washington D.C., suppressed on the high seas.  All those things, once you do that, you surround the South with what they called according to freedom.  Slavery would die of its own accord a natural death so the logical outcome of the policies associated with the doctrine of freedom national was that slavery would ultimately be extinguished.  That’s the language Lincoln used all the time.  We wanted to put slavery on a course of ultimate extinction.</p>
<p>
<i><b>CWBR: </i></b>   Based on this plan do you believe that slavery could have ended as many Republicans seemed to hope, without war?</p>
<p>
<b>JO:</b>  I don't know.  That's a hypothetical question and I've gone back and forth with it.  I guess if I had to come down again, it's a hypothetical question, it’s a counterfactual.  I don’t know, and nobody really knows, but I’ve gone back and forth about this with some friends who disagree.  If pushed I would say I don't think it would work.  I think they underestimated slavery's strength.  I think they underestimated slavery’s economic vitality and, also I’m not sure that how long it would have taken for the Republicans anti-slavery party to gain enough congressional strength to be able to implement that kind of policy to its fullest.  So, it requires too many assumptions about the potential power of the Republicans in the national power of the anti-slavery northern party and of slavery’s intrinsic weakness and its likelihood that it would die.  But, that said, it’s almost impossible to find a Republican who doesn’t believe that slavery will be put to death if these policies are implemented you get different estimates.  Thaddeus Stevens said do this, implement these policies, and it will be gone in 25 years.  Secessionist during the secession crisis said if we let the Republicans implement these policies slavery will be dead in 10 years.  When Lincoln proposed these policies for the Border States, the policies of gradual abolition, his preferred time table was 10 years.  But, Owen Lovejoy the anti-slavery Congressman, the abolitionist Congressman, from Illinois, said at one point during a speech in the 1850s, look we’ll give you 25 years if you do this, just start it now and if it takes 25 years that’s fine.  In fact if it takes 50 years that’s fine.  So Republicans did uniformly believe that if you implemented these policies slavery would eventually die. But, I don’t know if I really can say that I doubt that that would have happened, and I doubt that that would have happened based on not so much on my ability to see the counterfactual but because of what I saw happen in the Civil War.  That is slavery did not die even under 4 years of intense overwhelming military bombardment by the north, and a concerted campaign of military emancipation alongside the policy of building according to freedom.  Even with that I believe slavery would have survived the Civil War and I believe that’s the position most Republicans eventually came to by the end of the war.</p>
<p>
<i><b>CWBR: </i></b>   During the war you show that Republicans still work within Constitutional limit when working to end slavery, especially in the Border States, how important was the reaction of slave holders in the Border States to Republican’s emancipation plans?</p>
<p>
<b>JO:</b>  Well, the Republicans had two distinct emancipation plans.  The Border State plan is often mistaken as the primary plan.  So, that we get a certain positive trajectory that says the Republicans began by advocating gradual compensated emancipation and ended up by advocating universal uncompensated military emancipation.  In fact, military emancipation was a distinct policy, and it was applied to the disloyal seceded states almost as soon as the war began and the other policy of pressuring the loyal slave states to abolish slavery was applied subsequently because it was a peace time policy.  It couldn’t begin to be implemented until Congress came into session for the first time during the war, full regular session, beginning in December ’61.  So, almost immediately at the moment Republicans hit the ground in December 1861, they began noticing the Border States were resisting.  That there was a problem with the Border States and within a few months’ time they had comes to the conclusion that there was far less unionism in the Border States than they had believed.  There would be and that they were going to have to pursue a much more aggressive policy to force those states to abolish slavery on their own.  So, the reaction of the Border States accentuated and accelerated the aggressiveness of the Republican policy with regard to the loyal slave states.  But, it did not impede the development of the universal emancipation of military emancipation in the succeeded states.  What changed over time was the relationship that Republicans understood between those two policies, that is going into the war, Republicans, all Republicans, all antislavery people, for decades had assumed that slavery was weak.  Weak everywhere.  Weakest in the Border States.  That the Border States would be the first to abolish slavery and once it was abolished there it would seep further and further into the South as the intrinsic weaknesses of the system became more and more evident.  The shrinking power of each new Free State, Border State transformed into a free state, further weakens the power of the slave states as a block, and they believed that it would start in the upper South and then move to the lower South.  But, by the spring of 1862, they begin to reverse that premise.  Having implemented a policy of military emancipation in the seceded states they began to say to the Border States you know you better start abolishing slavery quickly.  Because if you don’t, military emancipation will seep northward into the loyal Border States and slavery will be disintegrated by, as Lincoln put, it the mere friction and abrasion of war.  So, I don’t accept the standard interpretation that says Lincoln’s concern for the Border States inhibited his acceptance of emancipation.  He, in fact, had accepted military emancipation long before, months before, he made his first proposal for gradual compensated abolition in the border states and, if anything, the war accelerated and made more aggressive the approach to the Border States that would have been there in a naturally peace time situation.</p>
<p>
<i><b>CWBR: </i></b>   You show a Republican Party bent on ending slavery, but how widespread were these ideas among the general northern population?  Does Lincoln’s re-election show that they understood and supported emancipation as much as Congressional Republicans did and did the average American understand the Constitutional issues involved?</p>
<p>
<b>JO:</b>  I think more qualified historians than myself have amply demonstrated that in this period of American history all issues, all major political issues, all sources of political division whether it be the Bank of the United States, the internal improvements, or slavery were framed in constitutional terms.  It was simply normal for Northerners and Southerners alike to frame all their arguments about slavery in constitutional terms and, it was universally insisted upon among republicans that they would never over step the bounds of the constitution by having the Federal government abolish slavery directly in the state where it was already legal.  That was simply understood across the board.  It’s almost impossible to find anyone in the United States in 1860 who believed that the Constitution allowed the Federal government to abolish slavery in a state where it already exists.  So that is simply the consensus of pro-slavery and anti-slavery people, Democrats and Republicans.  So all debate over slavery takes place within that consensus about the Constitution.  So I would have to say after that long winded answer that the short answer to your question is yes, Northerners did understand the constitutional limits within which the debate over slavery took place.</p>
<p>
<i><b>CWBR: </i></b>   Can you explain how the impending end of the war impacted Republican plans, were Republicans really as nervous about slavery returning in a post war United States that did not have a Constitutional amendment that ended the institution?</p>
<p>
<b>JO:</b>  Yes, this was a surprising discovery for me.  I actually began this book inspired by an event that was central to my last book which was the second meeting of Frederick Douglas and Abraham Lincoln that took place in August of 1864 when Lincoln looked he was going to lose his bid for reelection and he called Frederick Douglas to the White House for a second meeting and said to him looks like I’m going to lose and slavery is not yet dead.  We need your help to organize a cadre of blacks who can move unnoticed through the South to inform as many slaves as possible that they are freed because once I lose and go out of office the Emancipation Proclamation process will end and Douglas did not dispute that and I remember when I first started thinking about that discussion between the two of them I said well if that’s correct and Lincoln historians who say Lincoln freed all the slaves with a stroke of his pen by affixing his signature to the Emancipation Proclamation have got it wrong.  That Lincoln himself did not believe he had done that and that side who claim that the slaves freed themselves, that slavery was deteriorating, and that no force on earth could have stopped the revolution from completing itself, they must have been wrong also if these two guys very smart guys meeting in August of 1864 in the closing year of the war are agreed that slavery wasn’t dead and would survive the war if Lincoln and the Republicans were not re-elected.  Then I was going to have to investigate that and see what was going on there and when I did I discovered that in the book I’ve just finished, I discovered that this was actually a widespread assumption among Republicans.  That by late 1863 after the two anti-slavery policies had been implemented completely and fully the pressure on the Border States, the loyal slave states, to abolish slavery on their own.  All those policies had been implemented to put the pressure on them and not a single one of them had abolished slavery and military emancipation had been enforced at high tide beginning with the Emancipation Proclamation.  Universal emancipation had been decreed, a whole cadre of emancipation agents had been sent through the South to entice slaves off their plantations.  Blacks had been admitted into the Union Army by the tens of thousands and yet it looked like the North, the tide of the war, had changed with Gettysburg and Vicksburg in the summer of 1863.  It looked like the tide had changed in favor of the North.  The North was going to win the war but it also looked like by the end of the year again when republicans came back to Congress it looked as though the war would end with a northern victory but without slavery having been abolished and over the course of the next several months from December of 1863 to about March of 1864 Republicans debated among themselves what was the best way to get slavery thoroughly abolished and since all the various legislative proposals looked as though they ran up against the Constitution the only solution they could agree on was to re-write the Constitution.  In March, in the spring of 1864, the Senate endorses the 13th Amendment.  In June, the Republican Party endorses the 13th amendment in its platform and the House rejects it.  The Democratic minority defeats it in the House and the Republicans go into the 1864 elections committed to that 13th Amendment thoroughly abolishing slavery everywhere.  The other fear that I didn’t see in my last book but came pouring out of the sources when I went through them this time was not only that most of the slaves would not actually have been physically freed by the war.  The war would end with most of them still slaves but, also, the threat that once the war was over the Constitution would be restored, slavery would once again revert to the control of the states and the states would be free not only to perpetuate slavery but to re-enslave those who had ostensibly been freed by the war.  This was a threat that was openly made by slave state representatives from the loyal slave states on the floor of Congress and virtually every speech made by every Republican in defense of the 13th Amendment said this will do two distinct things, it will end slavery everywhere in the United States and it will make the possibility of it being revived impossible so the fear of re-enslavement ,the re-establishment of slavery after a northern victory was a crucial aspect of Republican motivations in pushing for the 13th Amendment.</p>
<p>
<i><b>CWBR: </i></b>   Why do you believe that most people today do not seem much in the way of emancipation taking place before the Emancipation Proclamation, is it they myths that have grown up around Lincoln or have historians not gotten the narrative correct?</p>
<p>
<b>JO: </b> That’s a tough question and the answer I give ultimately has to do with politics.  That is, we should probably explain that one of the things I try to demonstrate in my book is that in the very earliest months of the war when Congress came into a special session five months ahead of schedule, in July of 1861, Republicans began emancipating slaves and that there was an emancipation clause in the First Confiscation Act and the orders for implementing that law were issued by the War Department on August 8th, 1861.  From that date on you see emancipation spreading with the Union Army as it moved down into occupied areas of the Confederacy along the southern Atlantic coast and then in 1862 up the Mississippi Valley in Louisiana and ultimately up all the way into Tennessee and the areas occupied by Sherman and Grant’s armies.  So that by the time the proclamation is issued, tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands have already been emancipated under the various policies implemented beginning in the summer of 1861 and yet even as even before the Emancipation Proclamation was issued all of that emancipating was obscured by the nature of the debate over slavery.  I think the best answer I can give to why people in this secession crisis were saying disunion means abolition, and we are going to abolish slavery.  All republicans are saying this despite the fact that they have been in charge of the abolition process in the Sea Islands in the late 1861 and in Louisiana in 1862.  Despite that most republicans, began to say it was inconceivable to me that we would ever reach the point where we would emancipate all the slaves with the Emancipation Proclamation.  I think the explanation for that has to do with the fact that in 1862 when they are implementing a universal policy of universal emancipation in the seceded states is an election year and the Democrats begin to say, look we said all along that this was the goal of this party, that this was an abolitionist party, not a unionist party.  They don’t really care about establishing, their primary goal is not restoring the union, the primary goal is abolitionizing the whole United States.  Republicans respond by saying it was inconceivable to us that we would ever reach this point.  This is entirely the product of unforeseen circumstances in the war and exactly the same thing repeats itself in the 1864 presidential elections when right after the Republicans have committed themselves to a 13th Amendment and once again Democrats begin to say, and say all through the election, you see this is what we told you were going to have, a war without end until the Republicans successfully destroy slavery.  This is what they wanted all along and once again Republicans start saying no this was inconceivable to us we never imagined.  That’s when you start hearing Lincoln say it was unimaginable to me that we would ever get to this point where we would be abolishing slavery.  Everybody knew the war was caused by slavery but nobody could have imagined that the results were so fundamental and astounding.  Well, in fact, everybody had imagined it but in the context of the political between northern Democrats and Republicans the Republicans are put in the position of having to deny the charge that they had been going after slavery all along.  That was their primary motivation and in the process obscuring the fact that they have been going after slavery all along starting in the early years of the war.  That’s the best explanation I can have for the peculiar disappearance of all those emancipations in the first years of the war from the historical memory.  It would take someone who’s better equipped to study historical memory than I am to give a fuller answer.</p>

<p><b><i>Civil War Book Review (CWBR)</i></b>: Today the Civil War Book Review is pleased to speak with Jeff Strickland, Associate Professor of History at Montclair State University.  Today we get to talk about his most recent book, <i>Unequal Freedoms: Ethnicity, Race, and White Supremacy in Civil War-Era Charleston</i>.  Professor Strickland, thank you for joining us today. </p>

<p><b>Jeff Strickland (JS)</b>: Hi Zach, it’s an honor to speak with you. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: Obviously immigration gets a lot of attention in American history and obviously so does race, but in Charleston you find an intersection of both that often gets overlooked.  Why do you think that is? </p>

<p><b>JS</b>: Well I think that in part it has a lot to do with the way that historians treated Charleston, and mainly that social history—following trends of the profession—has only received significant attention more recently.  That includes the role of immigrants, for example in Charleston, and African American history as well.  That doesn’t mean that historians aren’t treating it, it is just that it still seems to take a back seat to political history in particular, and then also I think to a certain extent economic history.  So the intersection I think nationally and perhaps even internationally is a more recent trend, to look at immigrants and African Americans together. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: Germans and Irish started arriving in the 1840s, and that’s also just when racial divides in Southern society were really hardening, so how was that relationship early on?  Were they initially—immigrants that is—rather sympathetic towards the situations of African Americans? </p>

<p><b>JS</b>: I think that, reflecting trends elsewhere for example in New Orleans, the Irish and African Americans had more tensions than [between] any other immigrant group.  That trend is prevalent in Charleston, however there are these exceptional relations between the Irish and African Americans.  But there is definitely more of a class tension between those two groups, especially when it comes to free blacks, but even to a certain extent slave laborers, who were competing with Irish laborers for employment throughout the city.  Germans however, were decidedly middle class and primarily shopkeepers.  So there wasn't that sense of economic competition that led to tensions.  Therefore, it allowed for even more exceptional behavior, social and economic. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: That actually brings me to a side-note you made in the book.  I was wondering if you could talk about the fact that, just in terms of sources, you found--I think as would be expected--a little bit better record of German immigrants and what they were doing because they are a little better off when they arrive, as compared to Irish immigrants.  But then a lot of the time you say that when you <i>do</i> find Irish immigrants, they are doing some of the same things and adhering to some of the same patterns.  I was wondering if you could talk about that a little bit? </p>

<p><b>JS</b>: Yes, so for example German and Irish immigrants as slaveholders were underrepresented when compared to white southerners.  Then when you compared Germans and Irish, then actually the Germans were even less represented.  So there are Irish slaveholders in the city, even though the overwhelming majority of Irish immigrants are in fact working class.  And then when it comes to shopkeepers for example, I found a few instances of, for example, selling liquor to the slaves.  So the few Irish shopkeepers that did exist, some of them were getting into trouble for violating city laws concerning selling liquor to free blacks and to slaves.  Germans were doing that to a much greater extent, but from a standpoint of basic business practices, they were equal opportunity salesmen. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: So what was it about urban slavery particularly that sort of created the opportunities for these unusual interactions? </p>

<p><b>JS</b>: I think that when you think about the sheer numbers of individuals who are living in Charleston, I'd say between 1850 and 1860 say 40,000 to 48,000 people, you have a lot of people living in a relatively small space geographically.  So there were lots of different types of jobs that slaves and immigrants would work in and there were also lots of storekeepers in and around the city.  So I think that there are any number of possibilities for those sorts of relationships.  Also from a residential standpoint, what you find is that Germans and Irish are going to live in the same buildings and sometimes in the same households.  And the same is true of free blacks, and even in some cases of course when you have a slaveholder and their slaves, they might live in the same spaces.  So I think that historians have long talked about this micro-segregation of a place like Charleston.  That white and African Americans lived very close to each other throughout the city, yet it was often a class sort of situation where elites were living in the big houses and slaves in their quarters or in the case of free blacks, in shanties or in alleyways.  The same was true of immigrants.  You had very successful immigrants who were living in homes that they'd built, and in other cases Irish immigrants, laborers for example, also living in shanties.  There's the sense that throughout the city on a daily basis, people are interacting from both races--white and black--and also immigrant groups as well. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: At the same time though these interactions are defined by a social hierarchy.  Where to immigrants end up fitting, what role do they fulfill in that hierarchy? </p>

<p><b>JS</b>: One of the things that I talk about falls on social theory, which is the idea of a middle-man minority.  This concept suggests that immigrants who are middle class and potentially sort of unable to reach that southern aristocracy, will act as a buffer between those African Americans below them--both slave and free--and those elite white southerners above them, many of them in fact slaveholders.  In doing that, acting as a social buffer, perhaps it actually relieves tension between those two groups that might otherwise be more intense.  You can't read a travel account or travel narrative from the nineteenth century in which a European visitor for example arrives in Charleston, and they don't call it a cosmopolitan place.  They recognize there's something different about it.  The presence of these immigrants and slaves seems unique to them.  And of course you could go to New Orleans and find something very similar, but the fact that this was happening in South Carolina, and as we mentioned earlier, it doesn't seem to have been treated all that much historically or by historians, was very surprising to me when I embarked on the project. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: The tensions you mention seem to have been at times pretty high.  There was a real need by elite white southerners to impose some order and control on this and in a way it almost seemed like they turned to immigrants as a way of funding the police that they need to control the rest of the city, including the slave population.  Is that fair impression? </p>

<p><b>JS</b>: Yes, what ends up happening is that nativist movements that are taking place throughout the country also show up in Charleston.  So white southerners recognize that immigrants--they indicate that immigrants are undermining the slavery system.  In so doing they begin to come down on [immigrants] very harshly, in the form of arrests, imprisonment, and high fines.  Fines that would in many cases exceed annual earnings.  So that was one thing, and then at the same time what you find are examples of Germans and free blacks, and also slaves--in fact some Germans admit this later--that they were keeping slaves as concubines, and even going as far as to suggest that they did so because white southern women didn't want anything to do with them.  This is something for a German to write about in the 1870s, with no shame, and to get published in a national German-American journal, seems I think a bit odd.  So there's this sense that the Germans and the Irish were doing things that they shouldn't have been doing.  That the laws were very clear that they shouldn't sell liquor to slaves for example, that they shouldn't trade with slaves, and yet they continue to do it.  And I think that has to do with those numbers that I mentioned earlier that it was a very difficult thing to in fact police.  What you see in the 1850s is that the police force continues to grow in size.  Policing becomes very aggressive as the stranglehold on slavery tightens throughout the 1850s. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: In that context I found it sort of surprising that even before the Civil War a lot of immigrants, while they're resisting the conventions of white supremacy, and they're really taking some of the brunt of at least the financial aspect of this crackdown, their politics seem very difficult to pin down.  They seem to support a lot of Republican policies before the war, but they also support Stephen Douglas and the Kansas-Nebraska Act.  What do you think was going on before the war? </p>

<p><b>JS</b>: I think that before the war there is this whole question of necessity and whether or not if you were in fact antislavery, that you would even express it.  If there were--and I think that there were Germans who were unionists and did not agree with the institution of slavery--they weren't going to say it publicly for fear of being run out of town.  I also think that there was a sense even before one might arrive, that you would have to abide by that.  Either express your support for the Democratic party and slavery, or stay quiet, but there was no room for an abolitionist German or Irish immigrant in the city.  There were examples of Germans and Irish immigrants assisting slaves in running away.  When they were captured they were dealt with pretty severely.  So I think that there's that going on.  In the wake of the war you begin to see trends toward the Republican party that exist elsewhere in the country.  So a shift to the Republican party in the late 1860s was very opportunistic for the Germans in Charleston.  They had difficulty breaking into the Democratic party in town.  So if they couldn't overtake it, which is ultimately what they did, they were going to go ahead and become involved in the Republican party.  I think that it's not all that surprising, I guess, given that they were in a slave society, that wasn't going to tolerate any sort of opposition. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: It seems like they stayed even more under the radar, so to speak, during the war, when you have some of them volunteering for service. </p>

<p><b>JS</b>: Absolutely.  I think that's one of the reasons that for a long time people sort of assumed the Germans were good Democrats before and after the war.  But what you really begin to realize is that they volunteered for local service, sure, and of course some did actually fight outside of the [Confederate] Home Guard, but those individuals who had property signed up for the Home Guard and stayed close.  Or just stayed out of the conflict altogether.  So there was without question support for the Confederacy, and you're going to find that especially among folks who support white supremacy, who support slavery, but there were also individuals who wanted nothing to do with it and some of them left town, going back to Germany, and some of them went North to avoid it.  I think to a lesser extent some Irish were doing the same sorts of things.  And the Irish were trying to avoid conscription.  I think that's also a sign that there's clearly dissension within the city. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: As difficult as the war was, it seems like Reconstruction really ends up being a catalyst for German and Irish immigrants, if not breaking in socially yet, really breaking in economically or moving upward I should say.  At the same time their interests are very quickly reorienting away from any kind of common ground with black Charlestonians and towards the interests of white southerners.  I was wondering if you could talk about the role that emancipation plays in this shift? </p>

<p><b>JS</b>: Absolutely, what I found was that very quickly we being to see German and Irish politicians who were upwardly mobile were really drawn to the Republican party while at the same time in 1868, for example, we have sort of straight-out Democratic white supremacist ticket that [immigrants] were in many ways turned off by I think.  Although you'll see some names on the municipal ticket, with that failure on the local, state, and national level in 1868, Democrats recognize that they were going to have to enlist support from moderate Republicans.  So basically that's what ends up happening in Charleston.  Not only are they going to try to attract German and Irish immigrants over to the Democratic party, they're also going to try to attract some moderate African Americans, which they do a handful.  But what the Germans did in particular was when the nominating conventions were being held with each municipal election, was that they were really well organized.  In many ways they shaped the formation of those tickets.  Whenever those traditional white supremacist Democrats tried to regain control, the Germans would threaten to throw their support to the Republican party.  Many white southerners and white Charlestonians resented that fact. They weren't sure if the Germans really meant it or not, and I do think that they did.  They were much more moderate, and I think less white supremacist in 1868-1870 than perhaps they would become by 1876. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: Of course at the same time African Americans are asserting their rights as much as possible.  But all these economic barriers, which sort of eased for immigrants after the war, really crash down on African Americans.  They can't get credit, and maybe can start business but most fail I think within the first couple of years.  So a lot of their exercising of their rights ends up sort of being--these Fourth of July parades are emblematic of that.  I was wondering if you could explain why these public demonstrations were so critical? </p>

<p><b>JS</b>: Alright so with emancipation African Americans and German and Irish immigrants as well gain access to public thoroughfares, the public space that had previously largely denied them.  So African Americans on the Fourth of July are really turning out to express their emancipation, to express their freedom.  At the same time white southerners have decided that they don't want to be part of those same celebrations, that the Fourth of July, that Independence Day represents, in their view, emancipation now.  So of course we had Emancipation Day as well, but this is something that is taking place on the day that they formally would have shown up.  So basically the streets of downtown Charleston were decidedly the space of African Americans.  It was very unique and that trend lasted throughout Reconstruction and in some cases African Americans were showing up in large numbers even after Reconstruction.  I think that story, when I think about that black Charlestonians today would be interested to know that the Fourth of July was their day, and that white southerners and that white southerners really stayed away. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: And then critically there's another festival in town.  You'll probably have to correct my pronunciation, but what was the <i>Schuetzenfest</i> for the German community? </p>

<p><b>JS</b>: The <i>Schuetzenfest</i>, early on before the war, was literally just a moment to bring the Germans together, and the German rifle clubs, and just have a weekend festival where they went out to the <i>schuetzenplatz</i> and had target competitions and had various games for children and for adults on the grounds, and then later they would celebrate with a dance.  This was a very popular festival before the war, but only really among the Germans.  In the late 1860s, after the war has ended, the Germans decide to start this festival again, and indicative of their acceptance by white southerners, by white Charlestonians, they begin to invite white and black Charlestonians to this festival.  It very quickly increases in popularity.  I think one newspaper called it the Mardi Gras of Charleston by the 1870s.  So it was really a success, and the presence of African Americans in that space I think was very important early on.  It said something about the Germans' moderation and their lack of acceptance of the sort of white supremacist platform.  But, again reflecting trends elsewhere, by the end of Reconstruction you begin to see that the Germans are putting up fences, that they're not issuing tickets to a great extent to African Americans anymore, and that some of the various events that take place--amusements so to speak--during the actual <i>Schuetzenfest</i> are inherently racist, including blackface minstrelsy and other sorts of amusements.  That's what they called them, ""amusements."" </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: Did white southerners sort of become involved with this [<i>Schuetzenfest</i>] out of a combination of rejecting Fourth of July celebrations and being attracted perhaps--being former Confederates, former soldiers--to the martial aspect of parading and shooting, or did they just very explicitly, plainly see with this festival an opportunity to drive a wedge between German immigrant community and freed blacks?</p>

<p><b>JS</b>: Sure, so one of the things that the Germans do is they need permission from the military to hold this particular parade that begins through the streets of Charleston, and then makes its way to the <i>schuetzenplatz</i> grounds.  That means that they're going to be marching through the streets with weapons.  They receive permission because they argue that it's a cultural festival and they were doing it long before the war and it has nothing to do with the Confederacy.  However white rifle clubs, once they see that the Germans are doing this, begin to incorporate and reorganize.  They really see this as an opportunity to get out there like they were before the war and to display their martial prowess.  So yes, they very clearly recognize that they're not going to be able to do this on the Fourth of July, but they can surely do it on the <i>Schuetzenfest</i> weekend.  So I think it was a very explicit display of white supremacy, in large part because you don't see African American rifle clubs in these parades.  It's purely reserved for whites. </p>

<p><b><i>CWBR</i></b>: So by the end of Reconstruction, by 1877, the city's politics kind of seem to mirror the national controversy.  And this theme that we saw before the war seems to reemerge with Germans often supporting Republican policies but they're tending to vote the other way still, and really the cost seems to fall on the African America community.  So do ethnic communities in the South, when they look at the African American community, do they see a potentially ruinous battle in trying to resist to any greater degree white supremacy in Charleston, with Federal support eroding, do they simply retreat out of self-preservation, or is this a more profound new sense of self-identification more deeply with native-born white southerners? </p>

<p><b>JS</b>: I think that it could've gone a different way, but it didn't.  So as they begin to very clearly recognize that their economic and social and to a certain extent political success will lie with white southerners, that that association is much more beneficial to them than any sorts of alliances that they have historically had with the African American community, they begin to really establish stronger ties with white southerners.  I think it's also a numbers game.  In many cases if you look at the age demographics of Germans and even the Irish immigrants, by the mid-to-late 1870s you notice that first generation that the parents have begun to die off.  So this is largely a second generation ethnic American community of Germans and Irish, who seem to be much more socialized to their southern identity than their parents were.  I guess from that standpoint it's not that surprising but I also think that the fact that they were so upwardly mobile, that they do identify less with the plight of working class African Americans, who have found restrictions to that same mobility basically impossible to crack through.  I shouldn't say impossible because of course there were handfuls of successful African Americans who were doing quite well, but in large part you actually see in some cases African Americans are losing presence in certain skilled occupations, that they had been doing for decades if not generations.  By the 1870s you begin to see that they're being excluded from those same types of jobs.  In a sense it's one of the sources that's very good for revealing this kind of information. </p>

<i><b><p> Civil War Book Review (CWBR): </i></b> Today the Civil War Book Review is proud to speak with Gretchen Long, Associate Professor of History and Chair of the Africana Studies Program at Williams College, and discuss her recent book <i>Doctoring Freedom: The Politics of African American Medical Care in Slavery and Emancipation</i>.  Thank you for joining us today.</p>
<p>

<b>Gretchen Long (GL):</b> It's good to be here</p>
<p>
<i><b>CWBR: </i></b> So, healthcare and control over healthcare decisions were important steps towards freedom and independence for slaves? </p>
<p> 

<b>GL:</b> Yes that's right, before the war and during the war and after actually.  I had found when I started researching, or not even researching the book, but thinking about this topic, how often medical care came up as a kind of area of conversation between slaves and masters in terms of what kinds of medical care slaves would receive or master's displeasure with the kind of care slaves were giving each other and that just sort of got my wheels turning and I took it from there.</p> 
<p>
<i><b>CWBR: </i></b> How successful were slaves then at controlling their own bodies?</p>
<p>
<b>GL:</b> That's a really interesting question because it's something that sources hint at but we never get a complete and full answer.  But certainly, I think the level of frustration that slave owners had with and would report in journals or diaries or conversations with buyers or sellers of slaves, the level of frustration they had with slave medical practice, combined with the fact that many white families had black slaves look after them themselves.  That to me says there was quite a bit of medical care that the slaves managed to keep under their own purview and did not yield to white authority.</p>
<p>
<i><b>CWBR: </i></b>How did their roles as soldiers during the war, especially after injury, change the relationship between African-Americans and the government?</p>
<p>
<b>GL:</b> The thing about the Civil War is that particularly for slaves who fled toward the Union lines, but even ones that stayed behind, is that both systems of care were really offended.  Both care that the slaves communities provided for one another for fellow slaves and under the systems of white masters control or provision of medical care, both of those kind of have the rug pulled out from under them and in the Union Army so many slaves, slave men who joined the Union Army, showed up at recruiting stations in terrible health.  They had walked a long way they were malnourished.  Their families were in rough shape but they immediately, soldiers at least immediately, see medical care as part of the contract that they have with the Union Army.  That they are providing labor or military service and one of the things that they see the government needing to provide for them, and what the government does provide for white soldiers, is medical care.  So one of the most interesting things I found in terms of letters from black soldiers complaining to the government about the medical care they received because even though the soldiers felt that they were entitled to it, and did get some it, was often substandard and not at the level the white soldiers care was.</p>
<p>
<i><b>CWBR: </i></b>How did the problems of medicine and healthcare effect African-Americans in their transition from slaves to freedmen?</p>
<p>
<b>GL:</b> Yeah, I think particularly the ideal when you achieve freedom is when you own your own body.  Now how that body is taken care of and who takes care of it then becomes really essential to expressing that freedom, to any expression of that freedom, and giving that freedom meaning.  So, I have been really inspired by a lot of work that you are referring to that kind of puts the school house, or the church, or the polling place, or even sort of different realms of labor, that looks at those places as places where freedom happens, or where black people figured out how to be free in those places, and what I wanted to do is put the doctor’s office, the sick bed, and ultimately the medical school, on that list of places where black people gave their freedom meaning.</p>
<p>
<i><b>CWBR: </i></b>Why did organically developed black associations and brotherhoods work so much better to harness the efforts of the community rather than government directed efforts?</p>
<p>
<b>GL:</b> Yeah that's a really good question too.  I think in the associations, and like you said there’s a whole chapter in the book on this, for one thing the black associations I’m painting with kind of broad strokes here, but were better at identifying leaders, of knowing who should be in charge and how things should be organized.  Than when the Freedman’s Bureau came in and sort of ordained certain black men as the spokesmen for the group.  So, and of course, sometimes the black people were terrible at choosing leaders and I have some stories in there of leaders who swindled their associations out of money and this and that, but I think, for the most part, people, black people, knew certain men by reputation or kind of stature in their community, and those were ways of knowing that the white Freedman’s Bureau did not have access too so, and I think it was also a natural selection of the kind of community care that happened under slavery even though those slave communities were upended and disrupted with emancipation.</p>
<p>
<i><b>CWBR: </i></b> How did African-American attempts to become medical providers relate to the problems faced by the larger African-American community?</p>
<p>
<b>GL:</b> I think the one who gives us kind of where the window opens the widest on that period, is one of the doctors, John Hamilton, who lived in Austin, Texas, because he called himself a doctor and what he wants is for the Freedman’s Bureau to help him collect money from freedman that he says he’s treated, and the Freedman’s Bureau also to encourage freedman to go to him for their care instead of to the white doctors.  The Freedman’s Bureau has kind of set up their services and what happens is the Freedman’s Bureau says no way he’s a quack and a conjurer, and what's interesting to me is that a group of freedmen themselves write to the Freedman’s Bureau back in Washington and say yes indeed he is a quack and a conjurer.  So, his case really shows the diversity of opinion among freedmen and how impossible it can be to talk about a free community, or a freedman thought this, or that you know here was real division about who some freedman who thought he was a good doctor but refused to pay him and some thought he was a conjurer and a quack and should give up calling himself a doctor.  So I like that case because partially because it doesn’t really show an answer exactly but it does point to how  those letters happened in 1866 and the kind of the writing on the wall of what happens to folk healers like Hamilton.  They are not going to be able to make livings, or maintain respectability, in the eyes of white authority as we go forward in the decades.  You know his system of medicine is on the way out and the system of the whites Freedman’s Bureau, doctor’s practices, and that more and more black doctors, and I talk about them, want in on them.  They want for more medical training that is what's ascending, not just in the black South, but all over the country.</p>
<p>
<i><b>CWBR: </i></b>How did the professionalization of medicine by the turn of the century help or hinder the development, political activism, and solidarity of the greater African-American community?</p>
<p>
<b>GL:</b> I think that that last chapter in the book chronologically, the last couple of decades that the book, deals with the story, really shifts from a context of slavery and emancipation to a context of Jim Crow and segregation.  So even in scholarly literature we know that the waves of protests, and resistance, and solidarity, happened under those different kind of regimens, is very different by the end of the book.  There are very few, and by the turn of the century there are very few white medical schools that let in African Americans.  By 1910 most black medical schools have been shut down with increasing regulation, which did raise standards for medical education, but also cut off then  most of the avenues by which young black mostly men, could get medical training.  So when the book sort of ends right before World War I, we have a handful of black medical schools that are functioning, that are graduating black doctors, who want to become part of sort of this talented 10th class.  But, they are just a handful, and those doctors have a kind of political consciousness that I talk about.  That they manage to combine medical expertise in an almost urban sophistication with their political activism.  But it’s very different than the kind of challenges to white authority that we see from black soldiers, or from slaves, so the story really shifts when we start talking the kind of era of segregation, the ways in which black doctors and patients are able to mount any kind of protest is really shaped by the kind of larger American order. </p>
<p>
<i><b>CWBR: </i></b>So, in the end then, the role of health care in the black community paints a picture of the entire movement from slavery to freedom?</p>
<p>
<b>GL:</b> Yeah that's right and it plays and integral part in the development of the community in the midst of incredibly cynical suffering that a lot of black soldiers, and their families and freed people in contraband camps are really suffering during the war, and just after there the small pox epidemic, there’s a lot of poverty in cities, there’s a cholera epidemic in 1866, but through all this in advocating for the care they do get even though it is scant, and for advocating for medical education even though it is often substandard, they really seize on their rights and their kind of language that helps them present themselves as freed people. </p>
<p>

<p><b><i>Civil War Book Review </i>(<i>CWBR</i>):</b> Today, Professor Earl J. Hess, the Stewart W. McClelland Chair in History at Lincoln Memorial University, joins me to discuss his most recent work, <i>The Civil War in the West: Victory and Defeat from the Appalachians to the Mississippi</i>.  Professor Hess, thank you for joining me today.</p>
<p><b>Earl Hess (EH):</b> You’re welcome and good morning.  I’m happy to be here.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR</i>:</b>You focus your study on the western armies and the activity in the western theater.  What are some of the strengths and limitations of a geographic study of the Civil War?</p>
<p>
<b>EH:</b> That’s an interesting question.  I think some of the strengths are that we have a tendency, maybe, to under-appreciate the strength of regional identity in the 1860s in America.  Even though, I think a lot of people are aware of that, but still it is good to understand why we should think about that and have some deep awareness about what were the different characteristics of the regions of the United States and how they conducted the war.  I think there were some real differences between the West and the East and that is why, in the book, I often refer to the “western way” of conducting the Civil War on the part of the Federals.  There are four to five themes that could be discussed in that regard.  One of them was an almost overwhelming self-confidence that the western Federals developed in their ability to handle their Confederate enemy.  That, as many of the readers of Civil War military history know did not exist very well in the East for various reasons.  You have Robert E. Lee in the East, of course, and in the West you had different Confederate commanders and you had a lot of Confederate problems in the West versus the Confederate strengths in the East and a lot of Union strengths in the West that countered-balanced all that sort of thing.  In terms of limitations, of doing something like this, I guess maybe you can lose a sense of cooperation and I try to compensate for that by pointing out the numerous ways in which the East and the West cooperated with each other, not only the Union side but the Confederate side as well.  People know about the 11th and 12th Corps coming to Chattanooga after the Union defeat at Chickamauga in ’63 but, you know, the 23rd Corps went to the East and an awful lot of black regiments that were raised in Kentucky in 1862, most of them were shipped to the East and served in the Army of the James which, I think, is kind of interesting and not very well known.  There was an awful lot of regional cooperation.  Most of the troops down in the Department of the Gulf were northeastern troops instead of western troops.  There were very few troops from the western states down there in the New Orleans area.  </p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR</i>:</b> I wonder how is the focus on the western soldier beneficial?  Did he have a unique perspective on the war and the way that he looked at the big picture?</p>
<p>
<b>EH:</b>  I think there is an argument to be made about that.  I think the western soldier, because of Shiloh, tended to feel like they were surprised at Shiloh and in April of ’62 they came close to losing but they persisted; they fought very hard, they defeated the Confederates in battle, at least in their view.  And beginning with that and successive victories after that they developed a really, really striking self-confidence that, I think, historians and readers ought to pay a little more attention to as a major emotional factor in the winning of the war in the West.  Western soldiers, as they continued to be successful also were quite aware that their compatriots in the East (I am talking about Union soldiers) were not being successful.  They read in the newspapers about defeats at Second Bull Run and then Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville and they tended to be kind of disgusted by that and they felt like their counterparts in blue in Virginia were not pulling their weight in terms of winning the Civil War.  And so you can see some very striking commentary in their letters and diaries about that issue.  It is not just the rank and file as Grant and Sherman also paid keen attention to all of that and I think they were getting kind of disgusted by the fact that the eastern Federals were not doing all they could do to keep Lee occupied.  I think that the dispatch of Longstreet and two divisions from the Army of Northern Virginia to help win the Confederate victory at Chickamauga was something of a turning point in the mindset of Grant and Sherman, feeling that after they got the situation righted at Chattanooga in November of ’63 that something really needed to be done to better coordinate efforts East and West.  And when Grant was given a chance to command all Union forces, he really implanted that concept.  If there really was a western way of war in the Civil War, I think Grant brought it with him in March of ’64 to Virginia and, to a large degree, was successful in planting that concept over the whole Union war effort.    </p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR</i>:</b> You mentioned cooperation between East and West and I wonder what challenges did Union officers in the West have to overcome considering their distance from Washington and how did they get the administration invested in a war so far away when they are so concerned with defending the city itself?</p>
<p>
<b>EH:</b>  If anything, I think the western commanders were better off because of the distance from Washington because they had less interference from the politicians and I think they had a bit more freedom to develop a war effort as they wanted to in the West.  Obviously, they needed financial support; they needed other things too, that were basic to conducting the war effort.  It seems like there is a lot less political interference in the Union war effort in the western states than there is in Virginia.  And that may well be a factor in helping to develop this successful western way of war as opposed to the (in a degree in a way) the unsuccessful way of conducting the war in the Virginia theater, at least before Grant got there and kind of changed things around a little bit in the spring of ’64.  I also make the point in the book that I really think that Lincoln, who, of course, was Kentucky-born and lived in Indiana and in Illinois, he was a westerner, through and through.  He seems to have paid a lot more attention to the western theater and was pretty keen about doing, I think, the right thing to support there.  Jefferson Davis was, of course, also western-born in Kentucky too and he lived in Mississippi in the 1850s and et cetera, but he seemed to have paid less attention, or at least-maybe it is not fair to say he paid less attention-but his handling of western generals was less astute than his handling of Lee.  And there is an interesting dichotomy there between Richmond and Washington in terms of how they viewed the West and how they handled-and the success with which they handled-the western forces.  </p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR</i>:</b> You speak a great deal about the ways that occupation challenged the western armies.  How did this influence their course of war and what did the occupation period indicate about both Confederate morale and the ability of Reconstruction after the war?</p>
<p>
<b>EH:</b>  There are some big questions here.  It is a developing argument in the literature over the past few years.  A lot more interest is being drawn to occupation problems in the Civil War, especially guerrilla activity.  I did not have room in my book to get into a really big, detailed discussion of all this but I do not really see guerrilla activity or necessarily civilian problems, in general, as necessarily guiding, in important ways, the general course of the way the North fought the Civil War.  That is an arguable point, of course.  I really focus in my book on things that were integral to the movement of troops across deep, large, expansive enemy territory.  How do you do that?  You utilize effectively available technology like steamboats on the river system or railroad equipment where the rivers do not offer you the same opportunity as steamboats.  And, obviously, commanders have an awful lot of problems to deal with in terms of dealing with, sometimes troublesome civilians or with civilians who take guns and take to the woods and start taking pot shots at Union soldiers.  If you read through the dispatches of Union generals in the West, three-fourths, eighty percent of what they are discussing are issues like this.  And maybe only twenty to twenty-five percent of the time they are discussing how to move troops and how to deal with organized Confederate troops on the frontier between Union-controlled territory and Confederate-controlled territory.  But at the same time, I do not see any clear links between anger over guerrilla attacks translating itself into a greater desire to burn more territory or burn more resources to punish the South.  That effort to try to burn resources, to consume Confederate food yourself, that kind of stuff, all of that is hard war policy and has a half a dozen major origins.  It can range all the way from a simple desire by young Union soldiers who are hungry and they are not getting enough food from their commissary so they want more food so they just naturally go out on their own to take food from civilians.  That is the most fundamental reason why you have this developing and there are other reasons.  There are real limitations to the Union supply system.  The Union resources were not inexhaustible and the ability to transport supplies was not unlimited so a lot of times Union soldiers did go hungry because their commissaries could not provide them with, even their regular, rations.  It is true that some people did get angry at guerrilla attacks and think that they should burn in retaliation; that, of course, did happen too.  But there are many, many different streams of meeting that hard war policy.  I disagree, for example, with Daniel Sutherland argument in his recently-published award-winning book on the guerrilla war in the Civil War that it was a major factor in leading to the hard war policy and in altering the northern war effort.  I am not sure that that is a supportable argument.  But I think that there were two things going on here; I do not think that they necessarily relate to each other.  It is the organization and transportation and fighting of organized forces, won by the Union against the Confederates, but then there is a plethora of problems that commanders had to deal with in terms of occupying the ever-growing area of the South that Union soldiers no controlled.  I think that the Union side of the Civil War did a wonderful job winning that first problem and never really came up with truly effective (consistently effective) policies of dealing with the second problem.  I think they experimented a lot in dealing with occupation issues.  Sometimes it worked, oftentimes it did not.  In the end, it was the ending of the organized war that finally brought peace to the occupied areas and finally that is when guerrilla fighting completely evaporated everywhere by 1865.  </p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR</i>:</b> On the flip side to guerrilla warfare, you do mention, on several occasions, where white southerners throughout the war welcome the invading northern troops.  What accounts for this and how common was that occurrence during the war?</p>
<p>
<b>EH:</b>  The North would have liked to believe that there was a huge reservoir of Loyalists in the Confederacy and, of course, in some pockets there were, especially in East Tennessee.  That, of course, the biggest example.  The overwhelming majority of southerners in the mountainous counties in eastern Tennessee were Loyalist and vigorously Loyalist, willing to die for their beliefs.  You have a lot of Loyalists in northern Alabama  and western North Carolina, here and there.  Even in some of the areas of the South that are overwhelmingly pro-Confederate, you find a few Loyalists here and there.  And, you know, the same was true in the American Revolution where you found Loyalists to the Crown, especially in the southern colonies in the 1770s.  How do you account for it?  I am not sure that historians have answered that question; I do not think that necessarily I have either.  I actually live here in East Tennessee and so the idea of mountain Loyalism is very keen here and people know about it and they are interested it.  I do not think that any historian has yes really dug deep enough to try to deeply understand why that was so and they have a tendency to just, kind of, say that it was so and look at the effects of it in the 1860s.  There are a number of different reasons.  There can be some sort of anti-slave attitude and certainly it is true that the mountain Loyalists detested slavery, not because they were abolitionists but because they hated the fact that the ownership of slaves created an elite caste in southern society and so, to a degree it is a sort of class consciousness going on there.  The East Tennessee Loyalists tended to be very racist on top of that but that does not mean that their loyalism to the flag and the hatred of the planter aristocracy was any less.  And, to a large degree, the Union troops were keen to seek these people out and utilize them and, of course, as everyone knows, an awful lot of southerners served in blue.  Every seceded state contributed troops to the Union army, some of them more than others.  And that did weaken the strength of the Confederacy and its ability to opt for independence.  I do not know that it necessarily was the fatal weakness but it certainly was one of the many weaknesses to CSA defeat, especially in the West.  One point I make in the book is that the key difference in the West is geography; it is a huge, expansive area in the western Confederacy compared to the eastern Confederacy and so it has a lot more different problems, a lot more different aspects to it than the war in the East tended to. </p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR</i>:</b> It seems to me that, for every stalemate that we have in the eastern theater there is a victory and some headway made in the West by Union forces.  In terms of morale and maintaining foreign neutrality, was the West the Union lifeline to victory overall?</p>
<p>
<b>EH:</b>  That is a nice way to put it.  I agree with you.  That is a good way to express it.  I am not sure that contemporaries, or certainly contemporaries in the West, were keenly aware that they were winning the war.  I am talking about contemporaries so northern civilians in Illinois, Wisconsin, etc.  The press in the East tended, of course, to be focused on their region so they tended to be focused on the stalemate and etc.  And for some reason, an awful lot of foreign governments like the many people in the British government and the French government tended to focus on what was going in Virginia and probably did not pay as much attention as they should have to what was taking place in the West.  So you often have scares in Washington, D.C. about British recognition and all that sort of stuff.  Henry Halleck wrote a letter to William Rosecrans in December of ’62 when Rosecrans was preparing to lead the Union army out of Nashville against Bragg’s army at Murfreesboro that resulted in the battle of Stone’s River and Halleck informed Rosecrans that Lincoln is very, very concerned that when the British Parliament meets in January that it might recognize the CSA based on the horrible defeats at Fredericksburg and that sort of stuff.  And so they really kind of painted a picture to Rosecrans as if his campaign in December of ’62 that resulted in the battle of Stone’s River might be the turning point in the Civil War.  That is recognition that if the East is doing badly the West has an opportunity to try to take up the slack and, I think that, in the long run, that is exactly what did happen.  To me, that is one more way of seeing the West as the decisive theater of the Civil War.  And certainly it is true that, by early ‘65, the western war is basically won and the eastern war is not yet finished.  That is, of course, a big reason that Sherman decides to lead 60,000 tough, western Union soldiers, veterans of many successful campaigns and battles, to Virginia to give the final blow to Lee’s hopes of holding onto Petersburg and Richmond.  It is interesting to imagine Sherman and, by that time, 80,000 (Schofield’s 23rd Corps was added to it), what would have happened if Lee had stayed at Petersburg and allowed Sherman to join with Grant with those 80,000 troops.  You would have had an interesting development, an interesting campaign and set of battles to end the Petersburg campaign at that stage.  To me, it is a telling commentary of how successful the West was, that Sherman was able to take such a huge army and march it hundreds of miles to help end the war in Virginia.  </p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR</i>:</b> Taking a step back then, how did black enlistment change the war for both northern and southern in the western theater?</p>
<p>
<b>EH:</b>  Well, that is an interesting point.  In a very superficial way, you could say that it adds 180,000 troops to the Union army; that is a very; that is a gigantic contribution and even though most of those 180,000 black troops did not participate heavily in combat, they performed essential roles.  The vast majority of garrisons that were necessary to protect the Mississippi River after the fall of Vicksburg consisted of black troops.  Something like forty percent, I believe, of all black troops raised by the Union army over all in the Civil War were raised along the banks of the Mississippi River and those troops served almost their entire service guarding the Mississippi for northern commerce and Union military logistical support from July 4, 1863, until the end of the war.  That is the kind of service that does not get much publicity or credit because people tend to focus on the battlefield instead of this sort of thing but it is fundamentally important.  In less obvious ways, in other words and maybe in ways that are difficult to appreciate, in a kind of fundamental, underlying way, the recruitment of 180,000 blacks into the Union army, in a practical military sense that had a big import.  You could look at it another way.  Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation, which was the precedent for recruiting troops was arguably unconstitutional, certainly on shaky grounds.  But once you go putting 180,000 black men into blue uniforms and give them a rifle and train them how to shoot it, that confirms that there is not going to be any backsliding in American history to try to resurrect some form of legal slavery or anything like that.  It was, I think, a necessary important political and morale step intermediate between the Emancipation Proclamation and the Thirteenth Amendment which was passed by Congress in, I believe, late 1864 or early1865 perhaps.  On the Confederate side, the Confederates, as everyone knows, toyed with the idea of possibly raising black troops, finally did so very late.  Whether they would have had success if they had the chance, at the time, to put it more fully into effect no one can tell.  And, as everyone knows, too, the deployment of black Union troops on the battlefield tended to infuriate Confederate troops who oppose them, resulting in infamous massacres of black troops at Fort Pillow, for example which I briefly discuss in the book and in the eastern theater too.  And also maltreatment, even if they are not being massacred, often when black Union soldiers were captured by Confederate soldiers they were mistreated or they were sold back into slavery or they were used as labor instead of being treated as POWs as well.  </p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR</i>:</b> A simple question, perhaps with broader ramifications: At what point was the war in the West officially settled in your eyes?</p>
<p>
<b>EH:</b>  Goodness, in terms of major activity by mainline forces, with Hood’s defeat at Nashville in mid-December of ’64, coupled with the decision to transfer what was left of the Army of Tennessee to North Carolina.  Conceivably, if Hood’s force had remained in Mississippi after December of ’64 it might have done some more work too but after it was decided to shift Hood’s forces, now under Johnston, over to North Carolina that kind of ended it.  There was the matter of mopping up after that and there are some campaigns.  Of course, there is Wilson’s big cavalry raid going through Alabama and into western Central Georgia by the end of the war and there is Canby’s long, long-deferred major operation to capture Mobile in March and April of ’65.  But in hindsight, you can see that both operations could easily have not happened and the war would have come to an end when it did anyway but nobody could have foreseen that then.  But those kinds of mopping up operations are natural in such a huge expanse of theater of operations like the West where there are lots and lots of targets.  And you have significant numbers of Union troops around so you might as well use them and wind up the war because you do not know when it is going to end until it does end.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR</i>:</b> You have spent a great deal of time, in general, in studying both eastern and western theaters.  In your mind, was the United States Army of the Tennessee the most effective fighting force ever assembled?</p>
<p>
<b>EH:</b>  Yes, I would tend to say that.  Given the comparatively modest size of that field force, barely going above 30,000 men at any time period, and given its limited resources in terms of well-trained staff officers, in terms of well-trained engineers, it improvised an awful lot.  It had a lot of tough fighting ability and a lot of stamina, high morale and tremendous faith in their leaders, especially Grant and Sherman and McPherson.  I think they probably liked Howard maybe a little bit less but I would, in fact, argue that Oliver Otis Howard was a better commander of the army than McPherson was.  McPherson made some real mistakes in the Atlanta campaign even though he was a bright guy and a good guy.  So, yes, I would say so and, on the other end of the spectrum, the Confederate Army of Tennessee, Bragg’s force and Johnston’s force, of course, put in the least impressive record, I guess you could say of combat effectiveness and successful campaigns, not necessarily because of any faults that rest on the shoulders of the rank and file but for a variety of other reasons too, I suppose.  And the Army of the Cumberland, I would argue, is one of the more impressive field forces in terms of high levels of professionalism and innovative administrative efforts and all sorts of other things going on there too.  So, I think the western theater really provided some interesting stories and histories of different units from the field armies on down to regiments that are unique in American military history.</p>

<i><b><p> Civil War Book Review (CWBR): </i></b>  Today the Civil War Book Review is proud to speak with Elizabeth Varon, the Langbourne M. Williams Professor of American History at the University of Virginia, and discuss her recent book <i>Appomattox: Victory, Defeat, and Freedom at the End of the Civil War</i>.  Thank you for joining us today. </p>
<p>
<b>Elizabeth Varon (EV):</b> It is a delight to do so, thank you. </p>

<i><b><p> CWBR: </i></b> What drew you to this topic? </p>
<p>
<b>EV:</b> Well, some years ago, I was asked by the Library Company of Philadelphia to give a talk about Juneteenth:  the moment of emancipation in Texas.  And in the course of researching Juneteenth, I kept running across references in African-American discourse, spanning the immediate post-war era right up through the early 20th Century, to Appomattox as a “freedom day,” commemorated as sort of a hallmark in the process of emancipation. Those references alluded to an image of Appomattox as a day of liberation for slaves--the exact moment of emancipation, for many…the day that fulfilled the promises of the earlier Emancipation Proclamation, the day that some slaves knew for the first time that they were free, or that others were able to truly experience freedom for the first time, now that the principal institution of the Confederacy, Lee's army, had met its demise.  It was also a day, in African American commemoration, of black liberation at the hands of African American liberators.  This was a key element to the remembrance of the day:   seven regiments of the United States Colored Troops had participated in the final campaign that culminated in Lee's surrender.  They had been instrumental in blocking Lee's escape route, setting the trap that Lee tried, unsuccessfully, to punch a hole through on the morning of April 9. This was understood to have an enormous symbolic importance in the eyes of commentators.  We can see this in African American sermons and speeches, including the landmark studies of George Washington Williams, the eminent historian who was a veteran of the Appomattox campaign:   the treatment of Appomattox as a freedom day, and as a day that proved the fitness of the free people for citizenship.   In this post war discourse on Appomattox, there was an effort to fuse the emancipationist and reconciliationist modes of Civil War remembrance, to argue that the Union victory (and the centrality of African Americans to the Union's victory) were proof of the fitness for citizenship of the freedpeople, and also a moment that heralded a promise of interracial reconciliation. For me, this discovery drew me towards the surrender.   And my preliminary research confirmed that our dominant view of the surrender as a “gentlemen's agreement” does not do justice to the complex meaning and legacy of this event. </p>

<i><b><p> CWBR: </i></b>  Why was the campaign that led to Appomattox just as important as the surrender itself? </p>
<p>
<b>EV:</b>  That's right. There has been a tendency, a temptation, to think of that last campaign as a postscript to the great decisive “turning points” of the war. But that was not how the men who participated in the campaign saw it. They believed that the fate of the war effort still hung in the balance in those early days of April 1865. For men on the Union side, it wasn't just the fact of their victory but the way they had won it that loomed large. They would emphasize, in their accounts, that it took enormous skill and courage and discipline to chase down Lee's army, in those last days. For African Americans, the campaign had an additional level of symbolic meaning. Confederates, by contrast, are grappling at the moment of defeat with two competing narratives of these final days of fighting. One of those narratives, enshrined in Lee's Farwell Address, stresses the steadfastness and blamelessness of Lee's men in this moment of defeat. The other narrative, however, is a far more troubling narrative for Confederates. It is a story, perhaps, of a failure of will, and tactical and strategic mistakes, of disillusionment and desertion and disintegration. This is a story that is unbearable for Confederates. It leaves them vulnerable to self-doubt and recrimination, and so we see them push it to the side, and to instead enshrine the story encapsulated in Lee's Farewell Address:  the story of the Confederates having been overwhelmed by the brutal Yankee war machine, a story that fixates on the issue of odds. The Confederates will claim that they faced, in the end, during that last week and on the morning of April 9, in particular, worse odds than they had ever faced before in the war--odds of five to one or even worse--and that those terrible odds had necessitated Lee's surrender. </p>

<i><b><p> CWBR: </i></b>  So the ratio of Union to Confederate soldiers at Appomattox was extremely important to how Reconstruction developed? </p>
<p>
<b>EV:</b>  A numbers game emerges and it has profound political implications.  So--we can establish in hindsight that there were roughly thirty thousand Confederates and roughly sixty thousand Union troops in the vicinity of Appomattox Courthouse on that last day on April 9. The Confederates will claim, following Lee's lead, that they had faced much worse odds, in the end:  again, odds of five to one or worse, rather than two to one. (Lee had often beaten odds two to one earlier in the war.) They will claim that, in the end, they had only the eight thousand effective infantrymen that were really ready to fight--and that they faced a Yankee army of one hundred to two hundred thousand, and more, and so on. My point in the book is that Lee's reference in his Farewell Address to the “overwhelming numbers and resources” of the Yankees was political, and has to be put in the context of Confederate ideology:   that the numbers game had political implications. For Confederates, “numbers”--the very phrase--conjured up images of the Yankee army's ruthless mercenaries and hirelings. “Resources” conjured up the dark satanic mills of northern capitalists. The numbers game, in other words, was part and parcel of an indictment of the North, an indictment that had its roots in proslavery and secessionist ideology, and that was translated during the war into the charge that the Yankees did not fight fair.  This was important politically because Lee knew, as those who rallied around his “overwhelming numbers” interpretation of Confederate defeat knew, that by denying the legitimacy of the North's military victory, they could deny the North the right to impose its political will on the South after the war. </p>

<i><b><p> CWBR: </i></b>  So, as the importance of the surrender document, Lee's Farewell Address, the correspondence between Lee and Grant, and other writings show, during the Appomattox campaign itself the war shifted from one of bullets to one of words. </p>
<p>
<b>EV:</b>  Yes and no. I do think the war effectively ends at Appomattox.  We will sometimes use war as a metaphor to describe the political battles of the postwar period--and we should be careful not to push that too far. The surrender does end the massive bloodletting of these two giant armies; although there is fighting after Appomattox and the surrenders that follow in its wake, the hopes for Confederate independence, I think, died at Appomattox. In some important sense, the war ends. But a war of words does begin. You are right about that. A big argument of my book is that we tend to see the artifacts of the surrender--the letters Lee and Grant exchanged, the terms themselves, the parole passes that are issued to Confederates, the Farewell Address of Lee--we tend to see these things as transparent in meaning. I am trying to make the case that these artifacts of the surrender as all sources of contention. The parole passes are sort of a perfect case in point, speaking about this emerging war of words. So Lee and Grant meet a second time on April 10. Lee requests of Grant that each of Lee's men be issued a printed parole certificate confirming that that soldier came under the Appomattox terms. Grant accedes to this request.  Grant does so in part because he imagines that these certificates will remind the Confederates of the obligations attendant upon their status as paroled prisoners of war--that is what they are-- and remind them that their freedom was contingent on their good behavior. The parole passes contain a clause that ends up becoming quite a troublesome clause. In keeping with the language of the terms themselves, the parole certificates vouch that if a soldier observes the law where he resides, then that soldier was not to be “disturbed.” While Union men imagined that these parole certificates would be a reminder of their obligations, the Confederates interpreted the parole certificates, and the very language in them--the not to be disturbed clause in particular--as a kind of promise that honorable Confederate men would not be treated dishonorably but the Yankees. In other words, the paroles, in Confederate eyes, imposed conditions on the North. </p>

<i><b><p> CWBR: </i></b>  Lee has come down to us today as a person who stayed out of politics after the war, clearly though this was not the case, why is our perception so different from reality? </p>
<p>
<b>EV:</b>  Our perception is grounded in two facts. First of all, Lee did technically observe the terms of his parole.  And he did accept military defeat and reject the option of guerrilla warfare.  But we miss the subtlety and dissonance in Lee's post war comportment, and I think generally it is underrated how political a man and how savvy a man Lee was. Lee was not a symbol of submission in the eyes of Confederates after the war. He was a symbol of defiance. In all of the artifacts to which I have alluded, and also in a postwar interview that he does with the New York Herald, and congressional testimony he gives in February of 1866, Lee is pointing the way to the restoration of the South's power within the Union. Restoration is Lee's political keyword. For him it reflects the nostalgia, not uncommon for the men of his background, nostalgia for the days of the early republic, which in his mind are halcyon days before the Union had fallen from grace, before African Americans had been imbued with false hope--a time when the rest of the nation seemed to assume that Virginia would lead the nation. Lee was nostalgic for this kind of imaginary period of equilibrium. In his mind, a just peace will undo the “grievous effects” of the war, as he puts it, and sort of restore the old virtues. Now, in the service of this vision of restoration, Lee behaves politically. He denies the existence of anti-black violence in the South. He makes this denial quite brazenly as he testifies before the congressional committee. In his interview with the New York Herald, he essentially argues that if the North gives up the policy of magnanimity—if it turns to vengeance or to vindictive or arbitrary policies--Southerners would consider the surrender terms as breached.   Indeed there is this notion, I think, on the part of Confederates, that Lee had drawn a line in the sand at Appomattox--that Lee's position was, ""You can ask us to surrender our arms, but you shouldn't ask anything more from us. We will yield, but we will do nothing more."" This is a sort of defiance, and again we can come back to the artifacts of the surrender. The parole passes, that “not to be disturbed” clause, will reverberate in political debates. As Republicans will try to give freedpeople a measure of civil rights and civil protections, and begin discussing the possibility of African American suffrage, Confederates will turn to them and say that this radical agenda is a contravention of the Appomattox covenant, if you will--of the promise that white southern men will not be disturbed. They will literally say the prospect of black citizenship “disturbs” the South and therefore represents a betrayal of the Appomattox terms. There is a very complex political dynamic here. My point is that the terms and the artifacts of the surrender were a touchstone for these political debates during Reconstruction and that Lee is very much implicated in these debates. </p>

<i><b><p> CWBR: </i></b>  Grant and Lee then were representative of their societies, one looking to the future and the other to the past? </p>
<p>
<b>EV:</b> I think that that is right. Grant has an entirely different interpretation of the surrender than Lee does. In Lee's mind, the surrender was a negotiation in which he secures honorable terms for his blameless men. In Grant's eyes, the surrender is a vindication of the cause of Union, of the ability of citizen-soldiers to out fight the conscripts and dupes of an autocratic society. It is a vindication of freedom:  and it will clear and open the way for the Union's ethos of moral and material progress to enter the South. Grant's terms are very much intended to effect a sort of mass conversion on the part of Southerners. He believes that the terms should foster a spirit of repentance and atonement. Again, Lee's position was that the Southerners had nothing to atone for. Grant's position was that the Union's magnanimity and its mercy were emblems of its moral authority, its moral superiority even, and that mercy should effect atonement and repentance. These are fundamentally different views, but in the book I stress that these debates over the terms don’t simply pit Union against Confederacy or North versus South. They pit those who favor a transformation of the South against those who oppose it, and you will find Northerners and Southerners on both sides of that divide. The Peace Democrats, for example, “Copperheads” in the North, are loath for the Lincoln administration, Republicans, to interpret the surrender as a mandate for the Republican party.  So the Copperheads embrace Lee's interpretation of the surrender:  the “overwhelming numbers” interpretation of Southern defeat, Lee's notion that the Union victory was a victory of might over right. Southern Unionists, African Americans obviously, and some white southern Unionists, too, embrace Grant's view of the surrender:  the Union victory as a victory of right over wrong.  So we see fault lines, but we have to be very careful when acknowledging divisions within each society. </p>

<i><b><p> CWBR: </i></b>  Did the assassination of Lincoln magnify the meaning of Appomattox and make it much more important than it would have been had Lincoln lived? </p>
<p>
<b>EV:</b>  My emphasis, in a sense, in regard to the assassination, is on continuity. I try to show the heated debate about the meaning of the surrender begins before Lincoln died. Its interpretive lines persist after his death. If we look at Civil War historiography, we can see quite plainly that the assassination has utterly overshadowed the surrender. There has been an assumption in studying the assassination that Booth turns Northerners away from magnanimity and towards vengeance. I found something a little different. First of all, Northerners interpret the assassination as a direct response to the surrender. They believe that Booth is trying, through his deed, to undo or undermine the Union victory. We do see many Northerners call for vengeance in the wake of the assassination, but we see many others, in a sort of call-and-response, answer that cry for vengeance by upholding magnanimity and mercy--Lincoln's policy, Grant's policy--on the grounds that the best way to honor Lincoln's death is to uphold this idea of mercy. In other words, this notion that mercy was an emblem of the North's moral authority proves very potent and popular, and I found that was true even among Radical Republicans, many of whom thought the best fate for the likes of Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee was to have to live in the brave new world that the Union victory has created. </p>

<i><b><p> CWBR: </i></b>  Why did Appomattox become a ""golden moment lost"" so quickly? Was there any real chance it was the golden moment many hoped it was? </p>
<p>
<b>EV:</b>  This “golden moment lost” phenomenon is really quite fascinating. Each of the three interpretations that I just outlined--the notion of the surrender as a vindication; the emphasis on the part of Southerners like Lee on restoration; and then the variation on vindication, the emphasis of African Americans on liberation--each of these interpretive modes came to incorporate an argument about the lost promise of Appomattox. For Lee and his followers, as I have suggested, Radical Republicans betray the true meaning of the surrender by imposing a regime that contravenes the promise that southerners won’t be “disturbed.” For Grant and his followers, it is Andrew Johnson who is the arch betrayer, as he seems to capitulate to Lee's idea that the peace must bring the restoration of power to elite southerners. In the eyes of African Americans, whites on both sides--both those who oppose and reject black citizenship but also those who give up the fight for it--let this moment of promise, of Appomattox, fade unfulfilled. I am trying to make two arguments about this. First of all I am asserting that there is never a moment of unity in this story. There is never a moment of shared reconciliation. There is never a moment when Southerners in unison mourn their lost cause and northerners in unison rejoice. There is never a moment in which Confederates are prepared to concede that their ideology has been discredited. In essence, Northerners who embrace Grant's terms said to the South, ""We don’t want to punish you any further, we want you to change."" Southerners, Confederates, turned back and argued that the demand for change was a form of punishment. Northerners said “here is your chance to atone,” and Confederates responded that they had nothing to atone for. I don’t see much evidence of a true golden moment there. The battle lines were drawn very quickly. The terms became politicized very quickly. On the other hand, I am trying to account for why the golden moment interpretation, despite the fact that it was kind of wishful thinking, why it had such power and resilience.  I observe that it tapped a strain of American exceptionalism:  that even as they grappled over the surrender terms, Northerners and Southerners could, and did, congratulate themselves for ending their Civil War in a more civil way than any other nation had ever done before. I also try to account in other ways for the resilience of this golden moment idea. I stress, for example, as I have stressed in our talk here today, that African Americans have had their own reasons for upholding the surrender as a golden moment. They believed that they had, at the moment of the surrender, won something, and earned something, and proven something that should never be taken away. So all of the various stakeholders had their own reasons for being intensely invested in the idea of the golden moment--and for charging their political rivals was having betrayed it. </p>

<p>
<b><i>Civil War Book Review (CWBR):</i></b> I’m here today with George Rable, author of <i>God’s Almost Chosen Peoples: A Religious History of the American Civil War</i>.  Professor Rable, thank you so much for joining me.</p>
<p>
<b>George Rable (GR):</b> My pleasure.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> You seem to give a very even-handed treatment of as many religions as possible in addition to looking at soldiers and the homefront, men and women, and white and black.  How important was it for you to include this balance throughout your religious history of the Civil War?</p> 
<p>
<b>GR:</b>  Well my purpose was to write a comprehensive religious history of the war and I must admit, as the project proceeded, I was approached by a number of people asking me: “is my group going to be included” or “is my group going to be included,” so I was under a little bit of pressure even as I was working on the project but I thought if it was going to be a religious history of the war it should include as many groups as possible including non-believers.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> So often we focus on what made the North and South dissimilar.  Does a recognition of an “American” understanding of the war through religious avenues bring northerners and southerners together in this narrative; at the end of the day were they really very different religiously?</p>
<p>
<b>GR:</b> I think religiously, in some ways, they were not very different.  They both used similar religious frameworks to interpret the causes, course, and consequences of the war.  They both put a great deal of emphasis on providence and judgment to explain what was happening to them and what was happening to their enemies as far as that goes.  So I think studying religion actually does somewhat narrow the differences between the two sides though obviously I think they would disagree with that.</p>
 <p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> I was especially struck by your discussion of some of the Mormons in the West too who wondered about the South believing that God fought on their side and, at the same time the North did, and if both sides were correct that would lead to total annihilation.  How did they reconcile that fact?</p>
<p>
<b>GR:</b>  well I’m not sure they saw that particular contradiction or at least most people didn't see it.  Occasionally you'll get comments from people saying “well you know the other side is praying just as hard as we are, that may present a problem.”  More commonly, the assumption was that the Lord could not possibly allow their enemies to win, or could not possibly allow their country to fall, could not allow the Union to be destroyed, could not allow the Confederacy to be subjugated.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> You seem to suggest a new point of contention, the split of northern Methodists and southern Methodists, and the Baptists as well in leading to secession.  How did these splits help to affect the coming of the Civil War, and looking forward then, how did the North-South split of these denominations influence post-war churches?  Was it a legitimate and long-lasting influence for them?</p> 
<p>
<b>GR:</b>  Well both Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun thought that the divisions of the churches were quite ominous in the 1840s leading up to the heighted sectional conflict of the Civil War itself and I think that they were right.  Now I’m not sure one would argue that the split in the churches was a cause of the war; it was more a symptom of sectional tensions over slavery than anything else.  And of course the Presbyterians had split earlier and they did not split primarily over slavery.  But the fact that the churches are divided at the beginning of the war certainly does not lend any encouragement to sectional compromise.  In fact, one of the more interesting things I discovered in the research were the comments of Catholic editors who pointed out that “well this is what you get when you have a Protestant nation, when you have schism and division.”  If you had had a Catholic nation there would have been no sectional conflict and Civil War; the church universal would have been able to take care of that particular problem.  Now in terms of long-lasting impact, obviously these religious divisions persisted a long time among the Methodists, the Presbyterians, and of course the Baptists are still divided to this day.</p> 
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> For a nation that was so seemingly well-churched in the antebellum period, why do we see the debauchery and casting away of church services in camp during the early months of the war?</p>
<p>
<b>GR:</b>  Well they're heavily churched but also remember that probably only a minority of Americans were actually members of churches in part because the bar of church membership was pretty high at that time especially in some of the evangelical denominations.  On a typical Sunday you might have many more people in attendance than actual members of the congregation so I think that’s a factor.  Plus you’re talking about young men and these are not the most religious segment of the population, usually in that time or in our own, and plus these are young men removed from the influences of home and family and so it’s not surprising that under the stresses of camp life and battle and war in general you would find a great deal of what the people of the time would certainly describe as absolute debauchery. Although I suspect they exaggerated the degree of that from time to time so it’s interesting.  I think many of the more devout soldiers are absolutely convinced that a lot of their comrades are heathenish and I sort of take them at their word.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> As January of 1863 rolls around, President Lincoln officially calls into order the Emancipation Proclamation.  I wonder how this altered the message delivered by the southern clergy and, in turn, the message being given by the northern clergy to northerners on the homefront?</p>
<p>
<b>GR:</b>  Well let’s start with the northern clergy first.  Many of the northern clergy had been pushing for such a measure all along.  The northern clergy of course had been divided, some of the more conservative denominations like the old school Presbyterians had not been especially eager to embrace abolition or emancipation, but once Lincoln issues that final proclamation even the more conservative churches come around.  They naturally interpret the war itself and the fact that war has continued, a lot of them interpreted, as God’s judgment on slavery and once you cast off, what one minister called the Jonah of slavery, maybe the Lord would bless the nation with victory.  So again it’s interpreted as this sort of cycle of sin and judgment and then redemption.  The southern clergy continually embraced the institution of slavery during the war as the biblically sanctioned institution.  What changes for the southern clergy during the war is that the southern clergy become increasingly critical of the behavior of slaveholders.  In other words, slavery is not sinful in and of itself, in the fact that they scripturally sanctioned institution, but they become increasingly critical of the behavior of slaveholders for breaking up slave families through sale, for neglecting the religious instruction of the slaves, for not teaching slaves to read so that they were unable to read the scriptures.  So there’s a kind of reform movement that takes place during the war; the southern clergy advocate reform of the institution of slavery.  I don’t think they see this reform as leading to abolition and it’s interesting, however, that this reform gets absolutely nowhere.  Not a single one of these measures even reaches the floor of the state legislature or the Confederate congress; there’s some consideration committee, but that’s it.</p.
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> As the war progresses, you speak increasingly of the revivalism that takes place throughout some of the southern armies but you suggest that it’s less common among the western armies in the Confederacy and I wonder is it too much of an oversimplification to wonder if this fact helps explain the consistency of the Army of Northern Virginia and the canonization of the Army of Northern Virginia in Civil War memory?</p>
<p>
<b>GR:</b> I think it certainly helps explain part of the canonization of the Army of Northern Virginia in the Civil War memory.  Now if we could ask Stonewall Jackson that question, I think he would certainly say the revivals would mark a blessing of God, not only on the soldiers, but on the army itself.  And I think you could certainly argue that religion is quite important in sustaining the morale of armies but also keep in mind that there were revivals in the western armies as well they just came a little bit later and perhaps with less intensity and I think less organization.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> What does the study of religion say about Confederate nationalism and also war support or war weariness in the North?</p>
<p>
<b>GR:</b> Well I think religion is important part of Confederate nationalism.  In fact, you see such intense civil religion on both sides; you have presidents proclaiming days of fasting, humiliation, and prayer; presidents declaring official days of thanksgiving after victories; you have countless sermons preached and published on both sides on these special occasions as well as other occasions.  And I think religion is an important component of Confederate nationalism and it’s also an important component of American nationalism in general.  I don’t think the old thesis that somehow southerners were guilt-ridden and lost the will to fight and thought that God had turned against them really holds a great deal of water.  I think that there’s this persistent belief that God will somehow save them, even at the last moment.</p.
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> Spending so much time with this topic, would you maybe suggest that the war changed America’s outlook on religion or did their religious beliefs and spiritual outlook change their interpretation of the war as they were fighting it?</p>
<p>
<b>GR:</b>  Well I think religious interpretation shaped their interpretation of the war, there’s no question about that.  When you interpret battles in terms of divine favor and divine chastisement I don’t think there’s much doubt about that.  How much the war actually itself changed religious beliefs, of course, is a very difficult and complex question and I think a very debatable one.  Historians over the years have tended to emphasize a kind of disillusionment in the aftermath of war, a disillusionment in civil religion, though they focus most of their attention on intellectuals.  It seems to me that most Americans, northerners and southerners in the aftermath of this war, sought to rebuild their lives obviously in every way you can conceive and sought to rebuild their spiritual life as well and rebuild their church lives, and were not so much interested any more in looking back at the issues of the war but they were simply interested in rebuilding their religious lives.  And I must say I do not see the same amount of religious disillusionment in the aftermath of this war that some other historians have argued for.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> Would you maybe suggest that the religious fervor and the rate at which Americans used religion to cope with the conflict, is that unique to the American Civil War or might this simply be a traditional wartime response for any people?</p>
<p>
<b>GR:</b> I think the way religion was used during the Civil War, if not unique, was certainly more intense than any other war.  I know, at one point in the book, I do say that the American Civil War was the holiest war in American history and I certainly can’t think of any other war in which religion played such a large role.  Now obviously religion came into play in the American Revolution; religion comes into play in the War of 1812, the Mexican War, World War I, World War II, etc. but not nearly in the pervasive and all-encompassing sort of way as it did during the American Civil War.  I think it was a confluence of a lot of things, first of all, the Civil War itself was unique in the annals of American war and, secondly, it comes at a time of great religious expansion and fervor in America in general.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> Lastly, and we touched on some of this earlier, I’ve always been struck by the influence of Lee and Jackson’s piety on post-Civil War memory.  How did their religious beliefs influence their role in the Lost Cause mentality and why don’t we find more of a sense of the Union generals’ piety in post-Civil War memory? </p> 
<p>
<b>GR: </b>Well I think their religion was very important in Lost Cause memory because Lee and Jackson become kind of the ultimate Christian martyrs.  In fact Jackson’s death leads to all kinds of soul-searching about why the Lord had taken Jackson away from the Confederacy just when they needed him most.  And many pious Confederates simply concluded that, first of all, they might not be able to understand why God had done that and, secondly, perhaps they had put too much faith in Jackson or, as they put, it “too much faith in an arm of flesh” and God was punishing them for that reason.  Now I suppose the flip answer to why religion has not been as important in the memory of northern soldiers is, perhaps, that the more pious northern soldiers were not nearly as successful in the battlefield as Lee and Jackson.  O. O. Howard who probably, in some ways, is the ultimate Christian soldier in the North had a very rocky career in the eastern theater and a somewhat more successful career in the western theater.  George McClellan, I must say somewhat to my surprise, was remarkably religious as well and wrote things that could have easily been written by Robert E. Lee.  General Rosecrans was a very devout Catholic who loved to stay up late into the night discussing theology with various people including James Garfield, the future president of the United States.  So I think there are certainly Christian generals on the northern side as well, but they just weren’t as successful as lee and Jackson were.</p>

<p>
<b><i>Civil War Book Review (CWBR):</b></i> Your latest book is titled <i>""What Shall We Do with The Negro?"": Lincoln, White Racism, and Civil War America</i>. Now in this book, you attempt to revise what is really a celebratory depiction of Abraham Lincoln as the great emancipator by noting his reticence in many ways to ending the institution of slavery by force. How have historians, in your opinion, erred in chronicling Lincoln's record on the slavery issue?</p>
<p>
<b><i>Paul D. Escott (PDE):</i></b> There is a deep celebratory impulse in American popular culture in terms of the way we view our history.  And historians have been emphasizing Lincoln’s racial progressivism and racial egalitarianism, overemphasizing it I would say, quite a bit in recent decades.  This has not always been the case. There were earlier periods in American history which people praised Lincoln highly because he was considerate of white southerners and did not push for rights for black people.  But it's notable that in the last couple of decades, the emphasis on Lincoln as someone who worked for racial equality has gone a little too far. There are quite a number of things about Lincoln's policies that needed a careful reconsideration. I'll start, I think, by mentioning just a couple of them.</p>  
<p>
One would have to do with his expectation on what might follow freedom; and another might have to do with the Thirteenth Amendment and where he stood on the process of ratification for it at the end of the war.  It's well known that before Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, he had repeatedly proposed plans of gradual, compensated emancipation that could be voluntarily undertaken by the states, acting on their own. He always linked those to colonization.  What people have said less about is that after the Emancipation Proclamation was issued, he repeatedly talked about what he called temporary arrangements or apprenticeship.  Now apprenticeship may bring to mind Benjamin Franklin back in the 18th century, and we may think of it as something that would give people an opportunity to rise in society.  But that kind of apprenticeship had almost completely died out in 19th century America.  This idea of apprenticeship would be a way for slaveholders to hold onto the labor of younger slaves for a period of time.  That was always a part of his plans for gradual emancipation.  After he proposed the Emancipation Proclamation, he continued to talk about apprenticeship or temporary arrangements.</p>  
<p>
What Lincoln had in mind comes through very clearly in the letter that he wrote to General John McClernand in early 1863.  In that letter, he said to McClernand that if the southern states that are covered by the Emancipation Proclamation would adopt measures of apprenticeship, they could be nearly as well off as if this trouble had not occurred. He would be trying to provide financial aid from the federal government, and that would help them as well.  Lincoln continued to talk about apprenticeship or temporary arrangements as something that southern whites could expect once slavery came to an end.  And in his Amnesty Proclamation, the one setting up the Ten Percent Plan for reestablishing southern governments, he again talks about these temporary arrangements or apprenticeships that would be looked upon with favor by the president.  So I think that he was not expecting (and there's no evidence that he was pushing for) any drastic, immediate change in the social and political situation of black people once slavery came to an end.</p> 
<p>
What is also notable about the Thirteenth Amendment, is that although Lincoln deserves a great deal of praise for pushing Congress to propose the Thirteenth Amendment and to put in place a measure that would be a part of our Constitution to bar slavery (not just a war measure as the Emancipation Proclamation was), the prospects of ratifying the Thirteenth Amendment without force or a requirement by the executive were very troubled.  It would take ten states to block the amendment.  The Confederacy of course claimed thirteen. There were eleven southern states that had actively participated in the Confederacy.  There were also three Union states that had voted heavily Democratic in 1864, were not at all in Lincoln's camp, and were likely to oppose ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment.</p>  
<p>
Historians have not questioned that at the Hampton Roads Conference in February of 1865, William Seward told southerners about the proposal of this amendment but also mentioned that he expected it not to be approved.  Up to the very time of his death, Lincoln was still not insisting on ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment.  He was trying in various ways to offer incentives to white southerners to ratify the Thirteenth Amendment.  But he had not at all come to the point of requiring that.  And I think that that needs to be kept in mind in order for us to have a better understanding of what Lincoln's approach was and what his policy was.  He seemed very interested in first, pursuing the priority of getting the Union back together, and second, in order to do that, to offer incentives and means of conciliating white southerners so that they would participate in the process and take an active role in it, rather than be coerced into reunion.</p>  
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> You contend in this book that the true legacy of the Civil War regarding race relations is what you call ""a sobering future of segregation and racial exploitation.” And yet the answer you just gave, and in fact much of what you talk about in the book, seems to suggest that there is a continuity of racism and troubled race relations from the antebellum years to the Civil War and into the years of Reconstruction. Did the legacy of racism from the antebellum period ease in any way or do you just see a fundamental continuity over the years of the Civil War and Reconstruction?</p> 
<p>
<b><i>PDE:</i></b> I do see a tremendous amount of continuity. Racism was a very deep problem in the entire nation—North as well as South.  My last chapter points out and analyzes the action of three northern states after the war came to an end.  These states voted against proposals to let the small numbers of black people in their state vote as citizens following the end of the war. Racism did continue and there's a great deal of continuity there. The war really posed two problems or two questions.  One was: what was going to be done about slavery.  Following upon that was the next question, which many newspapers and magazines were asking, “What shall we do with the Negro?”</p>  
<p>
You can see in the way that the question was asked that it was flawed by racism.  The white people asking that question were assuming that they could dispose of the Negro problem, that they could decide what would be done with African Americans.  They weren't looking upon African Americans as members of the polity who would have a normal role to play.  It is striking that there was some change in racial attitudes in the North during the war. I was really surprised as I turned to a more careful study to the North (since most of my work had been done on the South) to see how quickly many magazines came around to the idea not only that slavery must be destroyed, but also that improvement in the status of black people needed to be undertaken.  <i>Harper’s Weekly</i> was far in advance in this regard, and quickly came to a position that the United States needed to confront its problem of racism and live up to its ideals. There also were Army officials who worked with freedmen in the South whose attitudes changed and who made recommendations that included full political rights for African Americans. Indeed many of these generals said that it would be necessary to give African Americans their political rights so that they could protect themselves against white hostility in the post-war world.  And there were others signs of discussion and some change of ideas in the North, especially before 1863.</p>  
<p>
But thereafter, in the later stages of the war, there was not as much discussion of the future status of African Americans as one would have expected.  I believe that Lincoln wanted to see slavery come to an end at some point, as I've indicated.   But even at the end of the war, he was not at the point of insisting on <i>immediate</i> emancipation for <i>all</i> of the South's slaves; he would consider some other possibilities.  Lincoln did not really do much to address this question of future status of African Americans. We do know that in his final public statements, just a few days before he was killed, he came out in favor of letting a few Africans Americans vote—those whom he called the very intelligent or those who served in the Army.  But he voiced that view simply as a personal preference, and he was at the same time, offering many conciliatory measures to white southerners.  So, though the war did address the question of slavery, it did relatively little to address the question of racism and the future status of African Americans. That was forced upon Congress during Reconstruction, but there wasn't a great deal of important ground gained on that front during the war itself. Of course, in the South, we know that there were proposals to bring slaves into the army and to free them, and there perhaps were a surprising number of white southerners who concluded that that needed to be done. Yet it's notable that the Confederate Congress absolutely refused to consider the idea of freedom for any black soldiers and was very tardy in coming around to the idea that some steps should be taken to bring slaves into the Army.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> In trying to answer the question you pose in the title, you chronicle how the Union conducted studies to decide what they should do with African Americans following the end of the war. And they actually produced some very valuable insights into how African Americans could live in the Union as productive citizens. Now, from what you've said, you suggest that Lincoln himself may not have taken much stock in that information that he received. Did other members of his administration and the cabinet receive the information about what role freedmen could possibly play in a reconstructed Union any more favorably than did Lincoln?</p> 
<p>
<b><i>PE:</i></b> Yes. Salmon Chase, the Treasury Secretary, was known as a strong advocate of abolition before the war. Chase was pushing for improvement in the situation of the slaves who had escaped from their masters in the South. But what is more surprising and really interesting, is the fact that Edwin Stanton, the Secretary of War, took a strong role here. Stanton had been a democrat, not a republican. As Secretary of War, Stanton concluded that to win the war and restore the Union, slavery would have to be destroyed.  He ended up favoring measures that led to studies and recommendations on political and civil equality for black people. Stanton, I could say, colluded a little bit with David Hunter, the general who issued a proclamation early in 1862 to free slaves in his military district.  Hunter wanted to do this, and he let Stanton know that he was planning to do it and said, in essence, ""Let me take the blame if need be."" Stanton was happy for him to go ahead and do that.  And then Stanton appointed the American Freedman’s Inquiry Commission. So the commission and various Union generals who were at work in the South gathered a lot of information about how the freedmen were fairing once they had managed to escape from slavery. They did write reports and, as you indicated, they recommended that the African Americans should be given the right to vote and should have means of protecting themselves as citizens in the polity once the war was over.</p> 
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> To what do you attribute Lincoln's reticence on emancipation on the issue of broader rights for African Americans?  How do his attitudes and opinions on slavery fit within the larger context of Republican Party politics?  In many ways, it seems that Lincoln might have drawn some of his conclusions and some of his opinions about slavery from his political idol, Henry Clay, who himself was very conflicted on the issue of slavery.</p>
<p>
<b><i>PE:</i></b> That's exactly what I was thinking as I heard you ask your question.  I do believe that Lincoln’s attitudes and ideas on policy evolved, just not nearly as far as some writers have suggested in recent decades. I believe that when the war began, his thinking was influenced a great deal by the man he called his <i>beau ideal</i>, Henry Clay.  Clay, of course, had helped to found the American Colonization Society. Lincoln’s advocacy of colonization was not accidental or trivial; he was very consistent about it and stood with it for a long time. Those who want to exalt Lincoln as a modern day paragon of equality like to point out that he did not publicly talk about colonization after January 1, 1863.  But in saying that, they ignore the fact that in March and April of that year, he entered into arrangements with some shady operators to send over four hundred African Americans to an island off Haiti in an experiment of colonization. It proved to be disastrous, and the people organizing it did not provide the support they should have, and many people died. So Lincoln did persist in this idea of investigating colonization, even after the issuance of the final Emancipation Proclamation.</p> 
<p>
Now as a Republican, Lincoln positioned himself pretty much in the middle—he was never as far advanced as those who came to be called Radical Republicans, but he was not as conservative as some of the most conservative Republicans either. But he always tried to stay on good terms with both camps, to keep all of his options open, to move slowly, and to see how the situation developed. I believe, too, that when Lincoln became president, he felt a real obligation not only to try to put the Union together but to adhere to the promises that his party had made to southerners. The platform of the Republican Party said that it respected the rights of states to determine their domestic institutions, and that slavery was not something the government should interfere with. He continually reminded people that he was trying to respect the Constitution and the rights of states.  His Emancipation Proclamation, if you recall, was issued as a war measure, under his authority as Commander-in-Chief in time of actual war.  So he was concerned, I think, to remind these southern whites that he was a reasonable person whom they could deal with, that he would be liberal in his dealings with them, and that he had not taken the role of a dedicated and bitter enemy of them and of their whole system. He wanted to bring them back into the Union on good terms. His efforts to conciliate them certainly came at the expense of the interest of African Americans in a number of ways.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> In 1864, Lincoln faced a reelection bid that even he, for a period of time, did not think that he could win. And as you discussed, the political dynamics of the time tested his resolve on the critical issues of the war and especially on emancipation. In what ways did Lincoln’s compromises on emancipation reflect his desire to win reelection and what impact did those decisions have on his policy toward African Americans after his reelection?</p>
<p>
<b><i>PDE:</i></b> Lincoln, of course, was an ambitious and practical politician, and he found himself in a real bind in the summer of 1864. In response to pleas from Horace Greeley that he meet with Confederate commissioners that Jefferson Davis had sent to Canada, Lincoln said he would be willing to talk with such commissioners, if they were empowered to end the war on the terms of putting the Union back together <i>and</i> ending slavery. The northern public at that time was discouraged by the heavy casualties that Ulysses S. Grant was incurring in Virginia and discouraged by how long the war had dragged on. There was a great revulsion in the public to hearing these words from Lincoln. People said, ""What? You’re making emancipation a condition of ending the war. That was never what you said before.” Lincoln and the Republicans had always argued that their goal was to reunite the Union, and that measures like the Emancipation Proclamation had been undertaken solely as a means to accomplish that end. So people objected and said, ""Now why have you made emancipation a condition of ending the war?"" Lincoln’s advisors and party leaders throughout the North told him that prospects were dark and that he was likely to be defeated. And he certainly believed that as well. So in response to that crisis and before the fortunes of war turned in the Union’s favor, he engaged in what I think we would see as rather typical political maneuvering.</p> 
<p>
Lincoln drafted, though he did not send, a letter that laid out the strategy. In this letter he said, in essence, ""Just because I said I would talk to these Confederates on certain terms doesn’t mean that I would refuse to talk to them if other and different terms were offered me. Let them try me."" Lincoln decided not to send that letter; I think that would have made him look like he was flip-flopping, in terminology of our day. But other members of the party put the same argument out. The <i>New York Times</i> was a notable example of this; its editor Henry Raymond was the chairman of the Republican National Committee, and he made that argument in print. Secretary of State Seward also gave a public speech in which he used language that Lincoln later repeated almost word for word in his address to Congress at the end of 1864. And it's difficult to make complete sense out of the things Lincoln said because they don’t entirely go together. On the one hand, he echoed Seward's words and said that the only thing that was necessary to bring the war to an end was for the southern states to cease their resistance. If the military resistance stopped, the war would immediately stop.  There would be no way that it would continue. Then courts and councils of legislation would decide all questions that remained regarding the future status of black people, “operating only in constitutional and lawful channels,” because the Emancipation Proclamation was merely a war measure. It's not entirely clear what Lincoln and Seward meant, but the Constitution certainly did not say anything about southern states that had seceded losing their rights. So it would seem that they would still have rights and would be involved in those processes. But Lincoln also went in the opposite direction, stating that he would not retract anything he said about emancipation and that he would not put anyone who had gained freedom back into slavery. So he engaged in a bit of double talk there.</p> 
<p>
As for how this affected the future status of black people or his policy toward them, I think the most important thing to point out is that, although he pressed forward with the idea of proposing a Thirteenth Amendment, Lincoln continued to leave the question of how it might be ratified in limbo and under a cloud because he insisted that the southern states should be involved in the process of ratification. He continued to talk about bringing those states back into the Union quickly. And I believe that there is good evidence that he did indeed propose to Alexander Stephens at the Hampton Roads Conference that Georgia could ratify the amendment to take effect prospectively, say in five years.</p> 
<p>
A number of good historians have questioned Stephens’ report and have said that we cannot credit it because Alexander Stephens wrote about that conversation in 1870—five years after the fact. But I found an article in the <i>Augusta Chronicle and Sentinel</i>, a Georgia newspaper, written just a few months after the conference, in which the editor reports on a conversation he had with Alexander Stephens immediately after the Hampton Roads Conference. The editor gives an account that is essentially the same as the one Stephens gave in his book in 1870. So I believe that Lincoln was still considering that sort of an idea, and that he did indeed bring this up with Confederates at Hampton Roads.  We also know that when the Confederate commissioners returned to Richmond, they discussed the issue with congressmen. We see from their correspondence that these Confederate congressmen were quite intrigued by the idea that they could reenter the Union and by the vote of ten states block the Thirteenth Amendment.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> Shifting focus to the Confederate policy on slavery and race in the waning days of the war, you discuss the effort to impress slaves into service for the Confederate war effort, a move that seemed to violate the very purpose of Confederate independence. But you argue that the plan’s supporters had ways of maintaining racial subjugation with or without slavery. What did they have in mind?</p>
<p>
<b><i>PDE:</i></b> The Davis administration was explicit about its ideas for the future of southern black people who might have served in the army and gained freedom under the other proposals. What they outlined was that after the war’s end, there could be an intermediate stage of peonage or serfdom before granting full emancipation. And during that time, the Davis administration was proposing that southern states could modify their laws so as to shield the South from some of the criticism that it had received worldwide on slavery. Laws could be passed that would protect the institution of marriage for slaves and give them greater rights to worship and learn to read the Bible.  In this way, things that had been the object of criticism of the South's peculiar institution could be ameliorated.  At the same time the freed slaves would not have equal rights, but would be in a condition of serfdom for some undetermined period. Given that no statement was made about how long that period might be, I think it was open for people to expect that it might be a very long period. But the Davis administration did put that idea forward and those who supported the plan knew this would be part of the future thinking of the Confederate government.</p> 
<p>
Nevertheless, many southerners were simply appalled by the idea of arming and freeing the slaves, and the Congress refused to go along with the idea of considering freedom.  But Jefferson Davis was still interested, as you know. Once Congress finally passed a law to bring some slaves into the army, he issued some executive orders that made clear that only those slaves whose masters would pledge to give them freedom would be accepted into the army. The Davis administration urged some of its allies in state governments to think about providing better legal means for manumission if it came to that and if the war continued and the Confederacy prevailed.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> How did the southern plans to perhaps use armed slaves in exchange for either emancipation or some form of receiving additional rights after the war affect Union strategy? How did Lincoln and his administration view these plans and efforts and proposals from the South?</p> 
<p>
<b><i>PDE:</i></b> I’m not aware of any document in which Lincoln discussed this. I think that northern commentators in general—newspapers and editors—saw it as a sign of desperation or weakness on the part of the South. They felt that it was an indication of how weak the Confederacy's position was and how close to collapse the Confederate war effort was getting. At the time that Lincoln met with the Confederate commissioners, the Confederate Congress had not yet acted. The emancipation proposal had been made, but for a period of about four months, the Confederate Congress dragged its heels and refused to act; it wasn’t until March that they finally took action. And then, only because the legislature of Virginia instructed its senators (who were opposed to the plan) to vote in its favor, was there enough of a majority for it to squeak through in the Confederate Senate by just one vote. But after the fall of Atlanta, I believe that Lincoln, his cabinet, and northerners generally were more optimistic about the ultimate result.  They could see that the war was going well and that the Union was going to win militarily, especially after Sherman had marched to the sea and had arrived in Savannah.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> Going back to the Hampton Roads conference, how earnestly did Lincoln negotiate with the Confederate representatives? Did he honestly seek out some sort of a compromise, peace settlement, or agreement? Or was he merely testing the waters with them to gauge what their situation was as far as continuing to prosecute the war?</p> 
<p>
<b><i>PDE:</i></b> I believe he was absolutely in earnest. He was firm on the question of reunion, but he was much more conciliatory on all other matters, including the ones that we've talked about. And on this crucial issue of offering incentives to the white southerners to come back into the Union and to participate in the process of the reunion even at the expense and interests of black people, I think that his sincerity is clear.  Not only was it consistent with everything he said before, but we know that after the conference was over and Lincoln returned to Washington D.C., he drafted a proposal for a constitutional amendment. This was something he was going to bring before Congress and ask the legislators to consider. The idea was that the federal government would provide a large amount of financial aid to all the slaveholding states, including those that were in the Union, if they would do two things: if they would bring the war to an end and if they would support the Thirteenth Amendment.</p> 
<p>
As he drafted that proposal, Lincoln was offering the South an incentive to adopt the Thirteenth Amendment by the summer of 1865—a shorter period of time than what he had mentioned to Alexander Stephens.  He wasn’t requiring it, but he was trying to lure the southerners into acting in this way. When he shared this idea with his cabinet, they were unanimously opposed. Most of the cabinet and many other northerners by this time felt that this plan was far too lenient, and that Lincoln shouldn’t be thinking in such generous terms. One of his cabinet officials said that he wouldn’t have minded the expense that was involved in providing this aid to the southern states, but there was such a thing as being too generous and going too far.  So Lincoln was not able to carry that proposal forward. But the fact that he drew it up and that he raised this as the next step to take after the conference shows that he was sincere and was dealing forthrightly with these southern commissioners, especially when he encouraged them to come back into the Union and assured them that he would be generous toward them and provide incentives for them to reenter the Union.</p>

<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> In viewing the continuity of racism from the antebellum period through the Civil War and into Reconstruction, you place this book in an interesting historiographical discussion about just how earnest the Republican Party was about endorsing equal rights for African Americans throughout the reconstructed nation. And as you suggest throughout the book, racism prevailed in the North. What role did the persistence of racism in the North play in the persistence of racism in the South—especially because the North was trying to dictate the terms of reconstruction to the South?  And did a majority of Lincoln’s Republican Party ever sincerely endorse equal rights for African Americans during the period of Reconstruction?</p>
<p>
<b><i>PDE:</i></b> That's a very good question and it's probably questionable that they did sincerely endorse equal rights. If you think of the Republican Party overall, it's hard to see that there was a drastic change from the thinking that Republicans had come to just before the war. In his fine book on the ideology of the Republican Party, Eric Foner concludes that Republicans believed that African Americans should have some rights, but the party had not agreed on the meaning of equal rights before the war began—that equal rights meant that African Americans men should be able to vote and that they should have full political rights. It seems clear that during the war, some Republicans did move in a more egalitarian direction and became convinced that African Americans should have political and civil equality under the law. But it’s also clear that there were other Republicans who had not moved that far, not to mention Democrats or others who were less favorable on these issues than the Republicans were.</p> 
<p>
Had it not been for the resistance of southern whites during Reconstruction, it’s doubtful that the Republicans would have agreed in Congress, or prevailed in Congress, on the idea that black men should be given the right to vote. As you know, it was the South's unanimous rejection, except for Tennessee, of the proposed Fourteenth Amendment that compelled Congress to reconsider the means of reconstruction in the South, if it wanted to change anything and to bring about governments that would be different in character from those that Andrew Johnson had created. It was the dynamics of the conflict during Reconstruction that pushed the northern Congress to the point of giving African Americans men the right to vote. Short of that, I doubt there would have been a majority in favor of doing it.</p> 
<p>
Northern racism remained strong and remained a problem. We need to remember, I think, just how pervasive and powerful racism was during period of the Civil War and Reconstruction. It’s part of our nation’s history -- it’s a deep part of our history that we need to remember and recall. I think that the celebratory strain in our popular culture wants to look at the Civil War as a great triumph in so many ways because it makes us feel better about the nation. But I believe that a realistic view of our history does not preclude our feeling good about some of the progress we’ve made. If you recognize the depth and seriousness of racism during the Civil War era, you also could feel that we finally have made a lot of progress since that time. It was a different world then and the pervasiveness of racism and its seriousness in the 19th century was far greater than what we have encountered in our lifetimes.</p>

<p>
<b><i>CWBR: </b></i> The topic of southern and Confederate nationalism has fascinated historians for much of the past 100 years, if not longer.  What led you to revisit southern nationalism? </p>
<p>
<b><i>Robert E. Bonner (REB): </b></i>  That's a big question. I was always interested in issues of the South's relationship to the rest of the country.  But the work that I was doing in graduate school—thinking about the national crisis and thinking about southern identity and American identity—led me to be skeptical of some of the conventional wisdom of how we frame the question of nationhood and slavery and the American South.  Out of these, I developed some general skepticism towards the leading propositions on the issue.  One interpretation presented southern slaveholders as distrustful of the federal government and distrustful of centralization.  The second interpretation presented them as becoming increasingly alienated from the national project in cultural terms.  My approach came from looking at the evidence and not really finding it matching up all that much to standard interpretations.  By looking at case studies by specialists on the 1850s, one recognizes that the nation really witnessed an escalating series of claims upon the national government rather than individuals exhibiting skepticism of the national government.  At the same time, we see white southerners as being key players in the development of a more robust strain of American nationalism rather than only being about a regional retreat from the federal government. And so in that respect, you have both Unionists and also fireeaters playing a role in national affairs.  For example, what in the world is William Yancey doing being a fundraiser for Mount Vernon?  And what is Robert Barnwell Rhett doing sort of glorifying the Boston Tea Party and trying to reappropriate it for proslavery causes?  So these notions of nationalism in the cultural realm sort of intrigued me.  The challenge of writing the book was trying to put these into conversation—trying to put the idea of nationhood as pertaining to federal power into conversation with a piece of nationhood that had to do with the cultural endeavors of the 1850s, in which white southerners played such a central role.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR: </b></i>  Whereas many, if not most, scholars have focused on either southern nationalism or Confederate nationalism, you take the unique step of investigating nationalism both before and after the creation of the Confederate States of America.  What new insights did you gain from incorporating both in your study? </p>
<p>
<b><i>REB: </b></i>  That certainly was one of the main things I wanted to do.  In fact, early on I wanted to go in past Confederate defeat into the Reconstruction period.  But as is often the case with dissertations, ambitions catch up with research and force the writer to scale back.  But certainly having two-thirds of the book roughly getting up to secession and then using the last one-third to think about Confederate nationhood has paid dividends in terms of the overall project. In the past twenty years, we have gained a richer literature on Confederate nationhood.  And you can ascribe a lot that to Drew Faust’s book, which really shook things up in terms of thinking about different Confederate nationalizing endeavors.  Faust thinks about Confederate nationalization as a process. I tried to follow the Confederate nationalists that she's concerned with and trace them back before the Civil War.  I looked at people who were crucial to forming wartime narratives of what Confederate nationhood was all about, and it seemed like over and over again these were the people who were staunch Unionists who in the 1850s were involved in all sorts of endeavors that transcended the slave South.  The clergy were certainly important in Faust’s perspective and they had really interesting things to say about American nationhood in the 1850s.  Tracing and going over the divide between the antebellum period and into the Confederate period, seemed to make a lot of sense because this is a book that focuses on nationalists rather than on the larger collective identity problems in traditional studies of nationalism.  By focusing on nationalists and on individualists, the sharp departure that Lincoln’s election and secession represented comes into clear perspective. And so the people who were trying to shape American nationhood up to Lincoln’s election seemed to have played a disproportionate role in trying to articulate notions of Confederate purpose and policy in the aftermath. </p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR: </b></i>  Your study focuses chiefly on the development of “master class nationalism,” as you call it, both within the federal Union and then in the Confederacy.  But what difficulty did the master class face in convincing southerners with little to no stake in the institution of slavery that slaveholder interests matched the concerns of common folk?  Or did the overwhelming majority of southerners identify with slavery regardless of their slave holdings? </p>
<p>
<b><i>REB: </b></i>   That's a great question. And to the extent that my story is about proslavery nationalists and trying to represent their interests on the national and world stage, I also acknowledge but do not explore this to the extent that I could and that others have. They also have a challenge in presenting their vision of the country, the region, and the main developments in their way of life to the population to those outside the master class.  They can’t take that for granted that they're going to get a solid support even within their own regions.  One of the reasons I didn’t develop that as much as I could have is because other scholars have developed that theme with such effect in other works.  The works of Bill Freehling, Eugene Genovese, and others have explored the master class's relationship to other white southerners. And so that wasn’t my topic. I had some ideas of following them and their work, and I would certainly footnoted them in terms of thinking about these ideas.  Certainly race, the political system, and evangelical religion, among other factors had something to do with it. These are all ingredients that led me into thinking about how other people have shaped that key problem. In the last chapter, I explore the key challenges of Confederate nationhood and the sort of rumbling class conflict that the war brings.   At that point the crisis of Confederate nationhood can be defined as a crisis that follows master-class nationalism—that has to depend a lot more on the master class and in the end doesn’t measure up. </p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR: </b></i> <i>Mastering America</i> focuses not only on the idea of nationalism itself, but the individuals who created and advanced the nationalist idea.  But in truth, can we speak of a unitary idea of nationalism? To what extent did individual southern nationalists differ in their writings and in their agenda not only for American nationalism but of course after 1861 for what became Confederate nationalism? </p>

<b><i>REB: </b></i>  That’s another great question that's at the heart of how I approached the multiplicity of different notions of what nationhood as a concept is really all about and the variance even within the master class.  The variety is I think the key. And so the chapters, the way I laid them out, really try to explore both the main categories of thinking about nationhood and even within those categories the differences of opinion. So you have lots of different perspectives. There’s a great array of approaches and again much of this book is an accumulation of research by other historians.  In that respect, I’m really fond of Michael O’Brien in terms of thinking about all the different riches and complexity and lack of uniformity that southern writers in particular have in approaching almost every problem.  So you have this array of different ways of thinking about the world and conjectures of different modes of social organization, political organization, and economic organization. As I organized the book into chapters, I did do it thematically and so I have chapters that in terms of those who predominately think, write, and act in behalf of the nation as a constitutional unit or as a body of individuals that are subscribing to republican ideas or evangelical ideas or efforts to create a notion of nationhood around shared historical memories. And so I do think that again it is maybe the heart of what I’m up to try to sort of break this down and to think about the variety. </p>
<p>
When we get to the Confederacy, I’ve got a chapter called ""Reckoning with Confederate Purpose,"" and there I schematize most explicitly these three main strands of thinking about Confederate purpose that perhaps do not have much to do with one another.  So there's three ways of thinking the Confederacy as a new endeavor and what it meant. Is it a replay of American Revolution?  Is it an opportunity to reject the American Revolution and develop new modes of thinking about authority?  Or is it an opportunity to perfect certain notions of paternalism?  Part of the objective is to lay out the breadth and the rigidness of thinking about nationhood. When we think about nationalism, we tend often times to pair it with notions of identity. And so thinking about southern nationhood is thinking about becoming more southern, or thinking about our American nation as becoming more American, or thinking about Confederate nationhood becoming more Confederate. And that's certainly something that in the 19th century, people were talking about; but they were talking about a lot of other different things in terms of what nationhood represented as well. And so I’m trying to recapture the 19th century understanding of nationhood in all its complexity.  Part of the reason it’s such an appealing concept in the 19th century is because building a nation or engaging in a national project meant so many different things to different people. </p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR: </b></i>  The most ardent proslavery spokesmen have gained the lion’s share of attention from scholars of the Civil War.  Yet you argue that, in many ways, the conservative Unionists of the South held the key to southern nationalism and southern politics.  How did they influence the course that the South took both within the Union and without the Union? </p>
<p>
<b><i>REB: </b></i>   They were able to be influential in part because they were just more of them.  We do get that notion, especially once you get outside of South Carolina, that prior to Lincoln’s election there was a small concentrated secessionist movement. And even after Lincoln’s election, I suppose, conservative Unionists, who you could define as people who have a vision of cutting a better deal within the Union, had so many different maneuvers.  Even those people who go to Montgomery to write a Confederate constitution are sort of holding this up as a means to get the rest of the states back into the Union—maybe without New England!   So they're influential because the southern populace, I think, does share a certain American feeling that bigger is better—that always wanting to bring in more territory is better than less territory.  And if they could do that on their own terms, if they could gain greater protections for slavery, especially with slavery expansion, then there's not much to argue why that wouldn’t be a good idea. For the secessionists, it’s better to have a smaller, more compact, and more overtly proslavery Deep South alliance independent of the rest of the states.  I think the conservative Unionists are winning the argument because they are getting a lot more throughout the 1850s; they're getting Kansas-Nebraska, Dred Scott, the administration of James Buchanan—the government sort of at their beck-and-call. So the fireeaters have a hard argument to make until you have the Republican Party take power, and suddenly their argument makes sense. </p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR: </b></i>  Don Fehrenbacher, who in his book on the Dred Scott case, which you just mentioned, noted that in antebellum political history so many political issues became constitutional issues, issues over interpreting the founding charter. And you seem to suggest that in some ways the development of southern nationalism represents the search for a southern version of constitutional theory, one that's built on inherited political forms but that secures important inherited rights, to use some of your words. To what extent did southern nationalists use the U.S. Constitution for their aims and what ultimately did they reject from the founding document? </p>
<p>
<b><i>REB: </b></i>  I did incorporate a lot of things about the Constitution into the book, especially in thinking about constitutionalism.  Let me maybe try to generalize the source of ideas I have about proslavery constitutionalism as I have articulated.  The constitutionalism that we generally think about regarding slavery is something along the lines of the fact that slaveholders showed up in Philadelphia in 1787, and by threats of various sorts, gained a lot of what they wanted written into the Constitution—the fugitive slave clause, the perpetuation of the slave trade, or the three-fifths representation of slaves. So proslavery efforts in Philadelphia gained a disproportionate role to slavery in politics.  One of the things that I’m trying to do is to maybe agree with that, but to think about constitutionalism as an ongoing process that involves continually trying to up the ante and trying to make an increasingly proslavery interpretation of the Constitution the predominant one as handed down by the Supreme Court and other governing institutions. I follow that process and try to think about how, beginning with the paring of states’ rights and proslavery arguments in the 1820s and then moving forward to how that plays itself out in the 1850s.  </p>
<p>
There hasn’t really been much written about sectional rights as a mode of constitutional argumentation. And so a long time ago, Arthur Bestor, in a couple of classic articles wrote about states’ rights as a doctrine of positive power. His work formed a lot of my thinking of how states’ rights can be not just about blocking but compelling the federal government into action in certain ways. And so from that original insight, I’m sort of spinning this out and saying that actually the language of the people in the 1850s is not so much states’ rights, but southern rights. This notion of southern rights is never something that is brought before the Supreme Court, but it does become part of a constitutional logic and a popular constitutionalism that incorporates the story of what happened in Philadelphia, not just separate states forming a union, but actually two well defined regions coming together and making a truce or a treaty between two regions. And this is something that filters into popular consciousness and forms a sort of political dialogue in the late 1850s that I found really interesting.  A lot of things going on in constitutional history now attend to popular constitutionalism. So I’m sort of picking up there.  You have a body of law school professor types who are thinking about how popular constitutional dialogue shapes politics as much as it shapes court cases, and that's certainly true of the 19th century.  So thinking about southern rights falls into this pattern.  But that’s something you'd never take before a court because of the court ruling could not understand that because there is nothing essentially fabricated on a thin textual basis, but it makes a compelling story to sort of show in a sense that slaveholders have rights because there was an original agreement between a South and a North, and that the North is sort of failing to live up to their agreement by, for instance, returning fugitive slaves to a South and that they're breaking this bargain. </p>
<p>
Therefore to withdraw from the Union is legitimate because the original treaty has already sort of been broken. It's striking how much you hear of the refusal to return slaves during the secession crisis, as the predominant explanations for why secession is legitimate. It’s maybe even more important than the fact that Union is a compact of states, that every state has the sovereign power to withdraw and that's certainly an important argument that’s being made in 1860-1861. It’s not just about the power, but why it has come time to withdraw. Again and again, it’s the North that has failed to live up to its constitutional obligations; therefore the South and the defenders of southern rights have a duty to withdraw if this isn’t going to get any better, which it doesn’t look like it is. So that's sort of a loose answer to thinking about constitutionalism. One of the things that also struck me is the dialogue about constitutionalism during the Confederacy.  A lot of nationalists began to think about constitutionalism as something that can really be set aside and so increasing the power of the Confederate government, increasing the power of executive within the Confederate government, not having a Supreme Court that would put the brakes on the enhancement of Confederate power all seem to me to be worth writing about.  This is something that people who have written about the Confederacy have pointed out before, but in light of earlier constitutional issues, they're right about the bottom line is that constitutionalism is about southern rights. </p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR: </b></i>  That's a fascinating insight because when you then discuss the idea of southern rights over states’ rights, and you cross that bridge of 1861 into the years of the Confederacy, does that then suggest that perhaps a number of people within the Confederacy itself might have been more amenable to a stronger Confederate government—a strong national government that nevertheless protected their rights? And this of course is not withstanding the states’ rights policies of men like say Joseph Brown in Georgia who's probably the most famous case of obstructionism in the Confederacy. </p>
<p>
<b><i>REB: </b></i>  You can’t, and I don’t, minimize the importance of states’ rights, in certain constituencies both during the 1850s and in fact during the Confederacy. I suppose that beginning with Calhoun, there are ways that people perceive that sort of strict states’ rights approach might not accomplish all that slaveholders needed.  I suppose more than anything else, the southern rights position is a more advanced argument, even if it’s not as prevalent.  But it’s also a very instrumental argument.  In saying that there are southern rights that you are basically saying that there are ways that the South can call upon the federal government to protect slaveholders rights.  During the Confederacy there are some noises about the fact that slaveholders need explicit protection against the government.  There are some interesting movements to introduce legislation at the state level to say the state government can never abridge slaveholders’ rights, nor can the Confederate government abridge slaveholders’ rights.  And so there’s a fear that a government, the new Confederate government, will disregard the sanctity of the institution of slavery in the same way the federal government disregarded the sanctity of the institution of slavery. To the extent that there’s a big debate at the end of the war about whether or not pair a program of slave enlistment with a program of general slave, that skepticism is well placed because the Confederate government at the end of the Davis administration is arguing for the preeminence of the sanctity of government over the sanctity of slavery. They're no longer talking in terms of southern rights; a lot of individuals at that point more going back to the states rights, especially the loud voices against slave enlistment about the program of emancipation and enlistment coming out of the South Carolina.  </p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR: </b></i>  Though southerners developed their own theories on constitutional law, they still maintained an attachment to the American past and the Revolutionary heritage.  Indeed, you note that southern masters sought to rescue the Revolutionary experiment from the “apostate Yankee Republicans” and to “redeem the tomb of Washington from the dominion of that fanatical rule”—to quote Charles Colcock Jones, Jr.  Did attachment to the American Revolutionary heritage help or hinder the development of Confederate nationalism? </p>
<p>
<b><i>REB: </b></i>   This portrays the sliver of the project, where I draw on the insights of David Potter on the conflicting loyalties of region and nation and interest in the 1850s. Potter includes some off-handed remarks about the Mount Vernon movement, the American Revolution, and the fiercely proprietary claims that southerners are making on the revolutionary heritage. And so Potter's work was really influential especially in framing the project to begin with. Thinking about the revolutionary heritage makes a lot of sense.  As you get into the Confederate period, it becomes even more so I suppose and that may be a little bit more well known in terms of other historians have written.  Faust and Anne Rubin, among others, have really thought about how Confederates answered these questions and made it a benefit to have an American revolutionary past at their disposal by popularizing the notion that this is the Second American Revolution, a moment of great historical importance that future generations will remember and identify with in the same way that this generation identified with the revolutionary period creating a whole cast of heroes and heroic episodes and so on and so forth.  That hot house environment of war does escalate and intensify the connections, but certainly in thinking about the identification of antebellum Americans with the revolutionary past. </p>

<p>
<b><i>CWBR :</b></i> I’m here today with Lacy K. Ford, author of <i>Deliver Us from Evil: The Question of Slavery in the Old South</i>.  Professor Ford, thank you for joining me.</p>
<p>
<b><i>Lacy K. Ford (LKF):</b></i> I’m happy to be here.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</b></i>    In <i>Deliver Us from Evil</i> you deemphasize the idea of a monolithic South, instead focusing on the upper South and lower South between 1787 and 1840 and the ideological shift over that time in the way southerners thought about the institution of slavery.  How did you decide to approach this difficult task and what made you want to explore the differences among southerners within the south?</p>
<p>
<b><i>LFK:</b></i>   You know I don’t know that I started out the project knowing that it was going to take that direction but I think that as I began to gather and sort through the evidence, it seemed like that there were different patterns of response and behavior.  Looking at it more closely, I could see that the sort of predominant division in that behavior was between upper South and lower South.  Now there were certainly some internal disagreement in the upper South and some internal disagreement in the lower South but there seemed to be a fundamentally different approach to things in upper and lower South and I decided therefore to tell the story moving from one sub region to another.  This is, of course, suggested in Professor William Freehling’s work: the first volume of <i>the Road to Disunion</i> more than a decade earlier.  I had read that and so I knew that there were important upper and lower South divisions that were going to have to be reckoned with but it was a matter of kind of going through the empirical data and just deciding this was the analysis that made the most sense.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</b></i>   Sure, just let the evidence lead you.</p>
<p> 
<b><i>LKF:</b></i>   Yes. </p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</b></i>    The concept of paternalism plays a large part throughout your study and has challenged historians for many years.  How would you define paternalism and what role do you believe it played for white and black southerners living in a biracial society?</p>
<p>
<b><i>LKF:</b></i>   Well before answering that question I’ll give you a little background.  I think the treatment that I ended up giving paternalism in the book was far different from what I had initially anticipated.  But I think that I came to understand through my research that paternalism or at least the central thrust of it (there was always some sort of noise around the edges) began as an insurgent ideology that came directly out of the church.  The Christian church and the evangelical denominations played a large role beginning in the Second Great Awakening or at least receiving its most coherent and consistent and determined expression beginning in the Second Great Awakening and that initially it was very much a sort of minority insurgence, in some ways even prophetic voice in the South with its message about slavery and it had a lot of skeptics, a lot of outright opponents, a lot of people who paid no attention at all.  But over time, in the way that insurgent movements do, it began to win more and more followers probably as the church began to have more and more influence and although it endured a great number of challenges, I think by the late 1830s it had become the sort of dominant ideology of slaveholding in the South certainly in the lower South.  Now, to some extent, it was a convenient explanation for slavery in the face of outside criticism and I think that convenience was an important part of its journey from sort of insurgency to a hegemony.  But I do think that the insurgency was based on a small determined but growing band of people who saw paternalism as the best way of understanding slavery.  So I think in some ways paternalism was a moderating influence among slaveholders in the South and that moderation helped actually helped slaves, not in the ways that the paternalists explained, but it helped slaves in their resistance in their ongoing efforts to carve out maneuvering room for themselves, to form and to have space, to develop their own culture, and their own sort of pre-political identity.  That, of course, was not paternalism’s goal at all.  It was kind of arguing that it was an ideology which would ultimately end in slaves kind of buying into the system and of course it did not achieve that but it was something that the slaves can use effectively to their own advantage even though if it had worked the way slaveholders wanted it to work that wouldn’t have been true at all.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</b></i>    You mentioned evangelical Christianity and you certainly emphasized its role in South Carolina and the part that it played in the slaveholding ideology for both white and black.  What role, if any, did this evangelical Christianity play in the upper South or other parts of the lower South like Louisiana where Catholicism dominated early on?</p>
<p>
<b><i>LKF:</b></i>    I think it played a very similar role, perhaps in slightly different time frames, across the lower South and in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and much of Louisiana outside of the New Orleans area.  I think Protestant Christianity had a similar influence and, while my discussion tended to be South Carolina-centered on that, I think I do treat Alabama and Mississippi, Georgia to some extent in saying that I think similar developments were going on there and charting them.  Now, because they were settled later and didn’t have urban centers like Charleston, I think it took hold to some extent a little bit later.  I mean in some places I think that there was not as intense of an opposition to paternalism, say in Mississippi, as there was in South Carolina but I do think across the lower South it was similar.  I think the story of the upper South is a little bit more complicated and in the end I decided not to try to tease it all out in an already long book but I think in the portions of the upper South which remained pretty deeply committed to slavery, the more heavily black regions of the upper South like the south side of Virginia, reached essentially similar conclusions as the lower South and Protestant Christianity played a fairly large role in the development of the paternalist ideology.  I do think in those portions of the upper South like western Virginia, where there remained a good bit of desire to minimize slavery’s role, people saw paternalism maybe as a very short-term alternative but not as good of an idea as selling off slaves to the lower South, perhaps colonizing slaves, perhaps looking toward gradual emancipation.  Therefore, because slavery didn’t seem to have (they didn’t want it to have) as much permanence, paternalism wasn’t embraced as anything other than a kind of short-term practical way of managing affairs.</p>
<p> 
<b><i>CWBR:</b></i>    You spoke of the resistance against paternalism.  You certainly challenge the idea of complacency among slaves but how prevalent were, not just revolts or scares, but daily resistance and individual violence and how did these instances shape white southern ideology?</p>
<p>
<b><i>LKF:</b></i>    I think slave resistance was always at work in shaping the way white southerners perceived slavery.  I do think there is a way in which (I don’t dwell on this as much perhaps in the book as I perhaps could have) white southerners thought they could manage the institution but I think they really thought they could handle and manage the day-to-day resistance that they encountered.  They thought that was kind of what it meant to be a slaveholder was to deal with that.  I think they remained more concerned about dealing with larger and more concerted action and particularly if they thought that action would occur with any great frequency and that the outside world might not support all of their efforts to put it down.  So I do think that, not merely the more common day-to-day resistance, but the threat of larger resistance played a role in their response.  But, I think at the same time, they tended to think they could manage all of these things.  What they debated greatly was: what was the best way to do it.  Some people had the idea that paternalism was virtually useless in that regard and others argued that this was actually the way to avoid the scares and these crises.</p>
<p> 
<b><i>CWBR:</b></i>   These scare and these crises, the actual open rebellions that you discuss in <i>Deliver Us from Evil</i>, mostly took place in Virginia, South Carolina and Louisiana.  How would you explain why you see little evidence of larger insurrection plots and scares in the interior states like Tennessee Alabama, or Mississippi?</p>
<p>
<b><i>LKF:</b></i>    That’s probably not a question I can answer on the basis of my research.  I think that there were certainly some scares in Mississippi from time to time.  How large and how much attention are given to these things somehow tended to depend a lot on how the whites felt it necessary to respond to it.  I think the alleged Denmark Vesey conspiracy could have almost been a footnote in history.  However serious you believe the conspiracy might or might not have been, it could have been handled with a lot less fan fair if the whites had chosen to do so and they chose not to do so.  And now Nat Turner, of course, is another story but in many ways the white leadership, in dealing with Nat Turner, sort of tried to minimize the significance of it in the aftermath.  Once the rebellion was put down their official word was: well it wasn’t that elaborate of a plot and so on and so forth.  And so that’s interesting to me and I think that more work could be done (I think I’ve made some suggestions about what I think or how I think white responses were shaped) probably more work could be done.  There may be a way in which,  I think more work could be done in trying to examine rumors and allegations in other portions of the South that haven’t gotten as much attention.  My guess is that similar kinds of things may have been happening all along and lower on the Richter scale of resistance that led to similar thoughts.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</b></i>    During your discussion of David Walker’s <i>Appeal</i> in 1829 you suggested that “the South as a whole had never reacted with any uniformity across state or sub regional boundaries to previous scares and insurrections.”  How was David Walker’s <i>Appeal</i> different and what role did it play in the potential unification of the South that you eluded to as it proceeded into the 1830s?</p>
<p>
<b><i>LKF:</b></i>    That was an interesting finding to me.  I had not anticipated that and I guess that maybe I anticipated that there would have been some unanimity earlier but even Denmark Vesey didn’t ripple across the lower South in the way that David Walker’s <i>Appeal</i> did.  I guess the reason is that it happened in a large number of places at approximately the same time and I think therefore showed the danger of a written document that could be seen as instigating insurrection was enormously threatening in a way that even a serious insurrection plot like Gabriel’s plot in 1800 really wasn’t.  I think that the abolitionist were quick to learn from that.  That’s why they came up with their flooding the mails campaign in the mid 1830s because they realized how powerful they could be.  So I think my best hypothesis about why that was such a sweeping scare was that those pamphlets arrived, not everywhere, but in many parts of the South within a fairly narrow time frame of a couple of years and therefore created a kind of simultaneous reaction which was something.  They were kind of in quasi-equal intensity everywhere.  I mean an insurrection scare is always going to have more impact in the area where it occurs and kind of dissipate, the ripple effects dissipate as they get further from the center.  But a printed appeal is a different thing and really that’s what happens with the 1830s.  It’s words on a page that I think drives the slaveholders into a frenzy more than anything else.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</b></i>    In response to a lot of these rebellions or scares starting in 1800, or even before, whites struggled to decide how best to deal with the black population so what I wonder is how hard was it for white southerners to reconcile their desires to whiten their locality to protect their safety with their continued desire to grow labor-intensive cash crops?  How did those who sought the diffusion of African Americans or colonization plan to continue cash crop production?  Where would the labor come from?</p>
<p>
<b><i>LKF:</b></i>    I think that was their fundamental tension.  I think that, particularly in the upper South where slave labor-generated cash crops perhaps either stagnant or declining, there was a real tension about that particular question.  The general answer to it in the upper South was we are probably not going to be without slaves anytime soon but we certainly would like wean ourselves away from as much dependence on slave labor and become a whiter region than we are now.  And I think, while that varied from county to county, there was a strong sense there but it was a big part of the debate.  In the lower South I think it was a tension that just almost couldn’t be resolved.  I think people could see that their staple crop prosperity depended on slave labor and the way to get more of it for yourself was to own slaves.  At the same time they could never quite get over this anxiety of the particular area where you live becoming too black and that was really, in some ways, the travail of slavery.  It seems to me, in the lower South was that tension between prosperity and safety really and it’s a delicate balancing act.  I think there was this kind of notion which involves a little bit of using suggestive rather than definitive evidence on my part because a lot of whites thought there was a kind of golden mean, that as long as the slave population didn’t exceed about 40 percent of a given area, things would be okay.  So when you are beneath that threshold acquisition of more slaves was a good thing and after that it was kind of something to worry about.  But the problem is there’s no way to implement that as a policy.  That’s kind of the notion and the microeconomic realities were once the people or many of them were going to acquire slaves if they could and you have portions of the lower South which are much, much blacker than 40 percent.  That created some, particularly in areas where some went through the transition later, a good bit of tension, I think.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</b></i>    Well you mentioned William Freehling’s volume one of <i>Road to Disunion</i>.  What do you think (in light of that and some of his other work) what do you feel that your analysis might tell us about why secession happened the way it did as the lower South seceded before Sumter, followed by the upper South afterward and the border states: Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland, and Delaware remaining within the union?</p>
<p>
<b><i>LKF:</b></i>    Well I guess I do think in many ways that what I’ve essentially done is (Freehling provided in his first volume a sort of, while it has a sort of social, cultural, and economic history dimension, it is essentially a political narrative) and I think that he laid out very nicely this kind of dialectic between the upper and lower South.  In politics in which the lower South extremism kind of nurtured moderation in the upper South which then drove the lower South to greater extremism and there was this sort of dialectic there.  I think that what I’ve done is go back and look at attitudes toward slavery that sort of underlay some of this political dichotomy and explain that in looking at attitudes toward slavery.  And then I think that that helps to understand some things that Freehling covers in volume two where the lower South is certainly more committed, more quickly to leaving the union, the upper South is more divided, some of it’s not ever going to leave the union, and some of it’s going to leave the union reluctantly, and pockets of it aren’t going to be happy that you’ve left, and so on and so forth.  I think that really shouldn’t be (once you’ve read my book) that shouldn’t be particularly surprising.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</b></i>    Well you state, and I quote: “by the late 1830s the upper and lower South had each decided that their respective answers to the slavery question lay in different ways of reconfiguring the institution,” and then the last sentence of your book states that your effort to “answer the slavery question explains nothing less than how and why whites in the old South created the self-images they fought to preserve in the American Civil War.”  Would you suggest that southerners fought for differing self-images of how best to practice and manage the institution of slavery?</p>
<p>
<b><i>LKF:</b></i>    Yeah I think so.  I think that, by 1840 and certainly by the time of secession, the slave holders in the lower South and common whites who agreed with slaveholders tended to envision themselves as defending this kind of paternalist notion of slavery which supported white democracy and protected the independence of the ordinary southerner.  I think in the upper South the slaveholders and whites that agreed with them saw themselves as people who understood the problem was related to slavery did not slight the moral implications that it might have held and were trained to work out, as best they could, a way of gradually diminishing slavery.  And as such were heirs of Thomas Jefferson and the founders as they understood them and were leaving the union only because they were forced to in a certain way.  I think those were differing conceptions of what everything was about and I think I would have been surprised if it were different.  There is some interesting work to be done and some has been done, but more could be done, to look at how notions of the Confederacy and the Lost Cause and what slavery had meant from a postbellum post-emancipation perspective but could still be done because as we all know Virginia emerges as a big Lost Cause state despite a very ambivalent attitude in going into the war.</p>

<p>
<b><i>Civil War Book Review (CWBR):</b></i> I'm here today with Kenneth Noe, author of <i>Reluctant Rebels: The Confederates Who Joined the Army after 1861</i>.  Professor Noe, thank you for joining me.</p>
<p>
<b><i>Kenneth Noe (KN):</b></i> I’m happy to be here Nathan.</p>
<p> 
<b><i>CWBR</i></b>: You suggest, in your introduction, that Confederate soldiers who joined the army after the initial enlistment wave in 1861, including later enlisters, substitutes, and conscripts, remain an understudied group in Civil War scholarship.  How did you choose to focus your study on the later enlisters instead of the substitutes or conscripted soldiers?</p>
<p>
<b></i>KN</i></b>: Well, that’s a long story and probably has two parts.  In terms of studying later enlisters in general, it really goes back to 2002 when I was a commentator for a session on the Civil War at the Library of Congress.  At that time Joe Glatthaar had given a paper on why soldiers fought and really summed up very nicely the literature that was out there on the whole question of soldier motivation as we have come to call it.  And I was actually in a bit of a pickle for a while because Joe’s paper was so good that I wasn’t sure exactly what I was going to be able to say as commentary.  But it did strike me as I read the paper again that there was an interesting problem in the literature that we had overlooked, that most of the research that had been done on Civil War soldiers on why they fought and why they stayed really focused on those who had enlisted early in the war and who had remained with the regiments for as long as possible and generally they were in the so-called fighting regiments that we talk about.  I suggested that day in Washington that, if we wanted a fuller picture of the Civil War soldier experience, we really to look at the conscripts and substitutes but also the men who enlisted later in the war.  Almost a quarter of the men who fought in the Confederate Army did not enlist in 1861; they enlisted later.  And while some of them certainly were young in 1861, although enough men lied about their age and enlisted anyway, most of the three-quarters were not, they could have enlisted right after Fort Sumter and I was really curious as to why they did not.  In terms of why the book ended up focusing on later enlisters more than conscripts and substitutes, that’s actually more of a research question more than anything else.  I really wanted to get into their thoughts and that meant reading letters and diaries rather than looking at other source of material that could help us to get to people who did not leave those written records.  I also wanted to focus on material that was written during the war; I was a little suspicious of things that would have been written in Reconstruction or Redemption or thereafter.  And what that left me with was a research base with quite a few later enlisters, although not as many as I had expected to find, but very few conscripts and substitutes.  I think one of the issues we’ll have to deal with as we move forward and try to understand conscription and substitution more is that we just don’t seem to have many written records, letters and diaries in which these men express their thoughts so we’re going to have to approach them through means other than the ones I used.</p>
<p> 
<b><i>CWBR</i></b>: You mention your methodology; you state your desire to use letters written by soldiers during the war instead of those post-1865 Reconstruction or Redemption accounts.  How does this choice shape your study and how might the later, more traditional sources have altered your study.</p>
<p>  
<b><i>KN</i></b>: Well I’ve worked with those later sources throughout my career and they’re certainly useful for many things.  In terms of trying to understand how people thought at a given moment I tend to be suspicious of materials that appear 20, 30, 40 years after the war.  I’ll give you an example actually from a different book that I’ve done.  Years ago I edited the Civil War memoirs of a Union soldier from middle Tennessee.  His name was Marcus Woodcock; he fought in the 9th Kentucky Infantry.  And really before the war was over, in 1865 after his regiment was mustered out, he came home and started writing his memoir, and got all the way up to the Atlanta campaign before he stopped, and part of that memoir includes a discussion of his first battle.  That was at Stone’s River.  He describes at one point the death of his best friend a man named James Tooley and he’s very insistent in this 1865 document that Tooley never saw it coming.  There was no discussion of “what would happen if I die,” certainly Tooley never came out and said “I’ve had this premonition that I will not survive the battle.”  Woodcock was very insistent that that did not happen.  Years later, towards the end of his life, I want to say 1911 (I should have gone back and checked the date but I think 1911) he started to rewrite that memoir again.  And when he got to the Stone’s River portion he was very insistent that James Tooley had foreseen his own death and had discussed it the night before the battle.  Well this was something that he absolutely denied right after the war.  Now why did Marcus Woodcock in 1911 believe that his friend had had this premonition?  I don’t think he was a liar; this was a man who spent most of his adult life after the war working for the Baptist Church in Tennessee.  But I think after reading all of his accounts of soldier premonitions over the years, Woodcock had come to convince himself that his friend Tooley had had one.  If I relied on that 1911 document instead of the 1865 document I would have a very different view of the death of James Tooley and that’s why in this book, in <i>Reluctant Rebels</i>, because I was really interested in trying to understand how they felt at the moment of enlistment, when they first got in the camp, when they first went into battle, I was suspicious of those later recounts simply because I wondered how many of them would have the equivalence of the premonition of the death of James Tooley as part of a narrative.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR</i></b>: On page 7, you quote James McPherson who said that the “prototypical unwilling soldier…was a nonslaveholding Southern married farmer with small children who was drafted in 1862 or enlisted to avoid being drafted.”  How would you change this statement or how would you summarize your findings based on the sampling of 320 soldiers.  Is it possible to describe the prototypical unwilling soldier in the Confederate Army?</p>
<p>
<b><i>KN</i></b>: Statistically half of them were not married. Statistically many of them were not farmers.  I was surprised to find the numbers of not farmers in the sample.  I did not find a great deal of evidence that they enlisted because of the bounty.  Now some men did clearly enlist because of the bounty (I would say roughly around 11 percent) but most of them offered no evidence of that’s why they had enlisted in 1862 or 1863.  There’s not a lot of evidence of men who enlisted because they thought they were about to get drafted so they did so; you could count them on one hand in my sample.  What I discovered were men who enlisted for a variety of other reasons: ideology to a certain extent but, again, not as much as I anticipated; men who enlisted more, I think, because they had by 1862 come to see the Union Army as a threat to their livelihood, a threat to their homes, literally a threat to their farms, their livestock, their slaves if they were slave owners, a threat to their family.  Once they had come to the conclusion that the Union Army was coming to their state, perhaps coming to their county, prepared to deprive them of everything they had worked for in their adult life, that’s when they start to enlist.  So on that point, I do disagree with Dr. McPherson, although I think he’s right about men who enlisted earlier in the war in terms of importance of ideology and comradeship and so forth.  I just don’t think that description carries over when we start talking about these later enlisters as a separate cohort.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR</i></b>: You mention these people who enlist when the northern army arrives in their area and you mention the ideology and sort of the different things that encouraged them to enlist.  It seems to me that it is very difficult to pin down a broad description of these later enlisters.  Could you maybe argue that these later enlisters were representative of a cross-section of southern society as a whole?</p>
<p> 
<b><i>KN</i></b>:  Well I think if we compare them to those that we have been reading about, if we compare them to earlier enlisters, I think it’s safer to say that they were less ideological, they were less motivated by the spread eagle speeches that were going around in 1860 and 1861.  They were certainly locally oriented.  Now that’s true of southern society in general; it’s a very localist society in 1860 but their localism, their attachment to kin and neighborhood strikes me as particularly strong.  In terms of being a cross-section and certainly in terms of age they run across the spectrum.  I discovered many more slaveholders in this cohort than I expected.  In fact, the number of slaveholders in my samples is almost exactly the same figure as slave holding families would have been in the Confederacy as a whole.  So, to that extent, they do reflect the region as a whole but I find them to be, in comparison to those who went before them, less ideological and more local.  They have less of a sense of country or nationhood than those men who enlisted in the summer of 1861.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR</i></b>: How difficult was it, then, to designate or pin down a specific reason for any one soldier’s enlistment.  Were there any common themes throughout or was it just simply certain soldiers mentioning over and over the reasons for their enlistment?  And, broadly then, do you see general themes coming out in these letters across the 320 when they are talking about family or war experience?  What sort of things, outside of reasons for enlistment were they concerned with in their letters?</p>
<p>
<b><i>KN</i></b>:  It was difficult; in fact it sort of became an issue at my house.  We'd have guests over and people would ask me what I was writing about and I would tell them I was writing about Confederate soldiers and they always wanted to know more and I found it was really difficult to explain the book.  It seemed to take me several minutes to go through all the permeations of what it was and what it wasn’t and what I was trying to do.  So, in that sense, I think it was difficult when it came down to actually trying to identify a thesis that I could explain easily.  One thing I did, in terms of trying to come to grips with these men, is that I wanted to count.  I think it’s easy to go through sources from this period or any period and find the things that we are looking for and emphasize those and perhaps de-emphasize others.  We’ve had historians, John Lynn comes to mind, Joe Glatthaar again comes to mind, who suggest that we need to be fairly rigorous with our research, that we need to actually count and compare.  So what I did was come up with a rubric of various things that I might expect to find, I added and subtracted as I went along, and I started counting in terms of how many men mention any sort of political ideology; how many men write about their country; how many men compare the Confederate Revolution to the American Revolution; how many men talk about religion; how many men talk about slavery; how many men complain that they don’t get their bounty.  And when I had those figures and started to compare within the work certain patterns really started to develop.  I found that well over a third of these men were writing about religion.  I found that a little less than 20% ever mentioned political ideology and for most of them it was one mention, here I followed Gary Gallagher’s rule that one mention is enough, and I think that’s probably a fair argument.  We don’t know what they said in camp, we don’t know how many letters were lost, but they’re writing more about religion than ideology.  They’re writing more about home than anything else.  They’re writing home and they’re concerned about how their wives and other family members are keeping the farms going.  They’re concerned about what might happen if the Union Army shows up.  They’re writing about their hatred of the enemy; there are almost as many who write about how much they hate the Yankees as who write about any sort of political ideology but when you look at that hatred even more what bothers them isn’t northern politics as much as this notion of Union soldiers as vandals, as property thieves; they’re going to come and take my slaves and my livestock and my land and my senses and leave me a poor man.  That’s the issue that really crops up.  So, in terms of doing these comparisons, I really did start to see patterns and more and more it struck me that these patterns were pointing back toward home even in areas that I did not expect.  In looking at religion, for example, how many men did not participate in those great revivals that we are always reading about in the winters of 1862-1863 and 1863-1864.  For so many of them their religious experience was taking place among their comrades in their messes or in their letters as they were writing back home still trying to maintain that position as head of family worship.  Comradeship was certainly important but it was a comradeship that was with men from home, relatives, and kin and I was surprised to find that they seemed to have trouble making new bonds with men that they had met in the army.  So again and again the numbers and the words as well were pointing me back toward home and away from what I think is the dominant interpretation right now of soldiers in general, which is that they were fighting for ideas.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR</i></b>: Let’s talk about these ideas and the political ideology.  What do your findings contribute to the long-time historical debate about Confederate nationalism?  And I wonder how you might account for, it seems to me you suggest a stronger, more committed nationalism among the early enlisters in 1861 than we see later; you suggest that that nationalism did not wane and other scholars have suggested so.  Why couldn’t this Confederate nationalism build within these later enlisters as they spent more time in the army and among the veteran soldiers?</p>
<p>
<b><i>KN</i></b>: Well it’s an interesting question.  It doesn’t seem to.  I think, like the soldiers that Jerry Prokopowicz talks about, their loyalty was more to company and to a certain extent regiment than it was to army or much less nation.  They just don’t write about nationalism that much; 61 out of my 320 mentioned any sort of political ideology but of those if you break it down, and bear in mind some men are in several categories because they are writing about 3 or 4 different things, I have about 10% who write about their country and as I said a few minutes ago most of them mention it once.  I have 5 or 6 fervent nationalists who write a lot about their country but for most of them it’s a passing phrase that pops up in a passage about something else.  We’ve read that the American Revolution was tremendously important to the Civil War generation.  Reid Mitchell was the first person who wrote about that and yet, out of my 320, only 9 of the men in my sample ever mentioned the American Revolution.  Nine percent, 29 out of 320, mentioned independence as a goal, as a fact in some manner, and most of them mentioned it once.  Subjugation is a word that James McPherson pointed us to, this notion of being forced to knuckle under to the Lincoln administration and its political ideas including abolition.  They don’t write much about subjugation; I think I have 17 of them that mention the word once.  And finally states rights, I mean growing up in Virginia I was taught year after year that Confederate soldiers had fought for states rights, not for other issues, and certainly not for slavery.  But in fact out of my 320, I only had a dozen who ever mentioned anything that looked like states rights.  These men were not nationalists; they weren’t ideologists.  I suspect (I can’t prove it; I don’t have enough men who write about why they did not enlist in 1861 to do more than suggest) but I think that it was that lack of political fervor, that lack of interest in those sorts of ideas that may have kept most of them out of the army when the war began.  But as the war dragged on and as the Union Army became more of an immediate threat to their homes, their neighborhood, their livelihood, they were spurred to enlist.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR</i></b>: You spend a great deal of time talking about the later enlisters and how they viewed their comrades and how they viewed the veteran soldiers who had joined in 1861.  I wonder if the early enlisters write about their opinions of later-enlisting comrades.  Were they considered equal on the battlefield and in camp or were they something of a newcomer, not as dedicated to the cause.</p>
<p>
<b><i>KN</i></b>:  Well I tended to look at these issues from the later enlisters point of view.  I really didn’t spend a lot of time reading primary material from the earlier enlisters as they wrote about the new ones.  I have looked at those sources for other projects from time to time and yeah I think there was a sense, in many cases, that these were men who were not as good as us, not as fervent as us.  You know a lot of them are here for the bounty.  These are expressions that I have seen in both in Union sources and in Confederate sources.  The way the later enlisters saw it though, when they arrive in regiments they are arriving in most cases as men who know where they are going.  They’re coming to particular companies and regiments when they can and various legislation makes that possible for them where they know people.  They are coming to this company and this regiment because their brother is there, or their neighbor is there, or somebody is there.  And I suspect that these transitions into those units, to an extent that men going to brand-new regiments are certainly conscripts would not find when they came to the army.  As far as the later enlisters saw, it they were just as good of soldiers as anyone else once they got there and they don’t really write about being shunned or unwelcome.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR</i></b>: During your discussion of the widespread shift later in the book, the shift away from card playing and rabble rousing in the southern armies, these sorts of sinful acts as those morally-concerned soldiers call it.  On page 133, you state that “what later enlisters now added to the mix was a pronounced family orientation that kept them mentally and spiritually connected to home.”  Is this shift away from these licentious acts, is that simply due to an increasing likelihood of older, married enlisters and the maturing of the veterans or is it just a general shift as the soldiers realized that war was not a party?</p>
<p>
<b><i>KN</i></b>: Well in a way I think it’s both.  Yes in a way you are dealing with an older cohort; my men are a few years older than that average we always hear of 21 or 22 but I think that it’s important to look at when they come to the army.  When we read these accounts of how wild and crazy camp was, Steve Woodworth has done this beautifully, we’re really looking at 1861 and 1862; we’re looking at men coming to the war without really knowing what the battle is going to look like.  My argument is that, by the time later enlisters start showing up in Confederate ranks in February-March of 1862, they’re joining a veteran army that has already by itself, to an extent, gone through that transition.  I mean yes there are some pious later enlisters who write about all the sinful acts they find in camp but I found a lot less of that than I expected and my sense is that the army itself, that army of earlier enlisters, had already made that transition because of the combat experience that had sobered them up.  So later enlisters, yes they’re older men, but they’re also arriving in, to an extent, more sober camps than those that had been in existence a year earlier.  So to that extent the army was never as wild for them as I might have been for people who joined up.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR</i></b>: In part of the larger discussion of maturing of the forces, what caused the widespread shift toward religion that began in Stonewall Jackson’s Corps in the Army of Northern Virginia and its subsequent spread westward?  Was it, as some scholars have suggested a conscious desire for southerners to legitimize their cause and give it a moral foundation?</p>
<p>
<b><i>KN</i></b>: Well I think there probably was some of that.  For later enlisters, in particular, because they’re the ones I know the best it was a lot more personal.  I think it really was, these are men who had a hard time leaving home.  By and large they did not want to be in the army.  They did enlist, they were willing to fight, they were certainly literally willing to fight but they wanted the war to end.  They loved to use that phrase “this cruel war.”  This was not a marvelous moment in their life, for most of them it was a terrible thing that happened; they wanted to go home.  When they got to the army they were faced with the reality of death: death in camp, death as a result of battle, they saw men dying, they saw their friend dying, they knew that they might not get home.  And I think that shaped their religious response.  If you go back to the time of the American Revolution, Americans (westerners in general) have a sort of vague sense of the afterlife.  They’re not really sure what heaven is going to look like.  It’s going to be good but there’s no real sense of well it’s going to be just like life on earth.  For a lot of reasons during the Jacksonian period, by the time we get to 1860, there is a sense among American Protestants, North and South, that heaven is going to look a whole lot like home, that when a Christian dies and goes to heaven that man is going to live in a small nuclear household with his wife and with his kids if they too were saved and if they too were able to get to heaven and that life was going to go on pretty much as it had before only better.  So what happens with a lot of these men is that they start using the same phrase over and over.  They start writing their wives and their children to an extent and they say “let us meet in heaven, if we do not again meet on this earth, let us meet in heaven” and they spend a lot of time trying to convince their wives and their children to live good Christian lives.  I think it was the ultimate way of getting home for men who weren’t sure that they were going to get back to their earthly home in North Carolina or Alabama or wherever, there was still that hope that belief that their families would be reunited in a home in the afterlife.  And so again for them religion tends to be very, very personal.  They don’t write very much at all about the Confederacy as a Christian nation, that they are Christian soldiers that they are fighting against godless abolition; I mean there are a very small number of them that do.  Their religion for them I think it was for antebellum southerners as a whole was very personal and very, very family oriented and, to an extent, individual and that’s really what drives their religious expression through the war.</p>

<b><i>CWBR</i></b>: In summary then, do we have some sense of what happened to these 320 soldiers from your sample that you built your study around?  Do you know how many died during the war?  And I wonder how, I know you wanted to focus on their writings during the war, but I wonder how their post-war memories or reflections might have differed from their feelings during the war?</p>
<p>
<b><i>KN</i></b>: It’s a wonderful question.  Those who survived, and some of them did, I mean how did they look back on the war 30 and 40 years later and that’s probably another good study to be written but that’s not something that I looked at.  I wasn’t interested in their memories so much as I was interested in their experience so I would certainly encourage anybody who wanted to take my sample and track these men down in the published literature of the 1870s and 80s and 90s to see how they regarded the war experience.  I think that would be interesting; it’s not something that I did.  A lot of my men died in the hospital.  I was shocked at how many of them actually spent time in the hospital and, as I think is the case for every Civil War historian and as I think you are working through the collections of letters and diaries, there’s always that moment when the collection ends and you know that the soldier has died and that happened a lot, you know they are writing these letters from hospitals “I think I’m getting better” when in fact they weren’t.  The memory question is an interesting one and it certainly memory is certainly something I’ve been interested in over the years but it’s not something that I did with this project.  What I really wanted to do was make a contribution to the soldier motivation literature that we have out there and in the same way that say McPherson did not look at their memories 30 or 40 years later or Chandra Manning didn’t look at those I didn’t either what I was really trying to do was fit my work into that literature.</p>
