2158	945612710	$29.95	Rally, Once Again!: Selected Civil War Writings of Alan T. Nolan		Nolan, Alan T.			"Alan T. Nolan is probably best known for two books, written 30 years apart. The first, <i>The Iron Brigade</i>, was published in 1961 and hailed as a model unit history. Three decades later, Nolan wrote  <i>Lee Considered: General Robert E. Lee and Civil War History</i>, a much more controversial book than his study of the Iron Brigade. <i>Lee Considered</i> is a harsh indictment of the famous southern general, contrasting the mythic Lee with what Nolan argues was the actual, and much more flawed, man.  <p> Openly criticizing the Confederacy's best-loved commander has always been risky business, and Nolan instantly earned the ire of many Civil War enthusiasts enamored with the mythic version of the ""Lost Cause"" Confederacy. One especially irate reader wrote a letter in 1992 to <i>Civil War News</i> urging fellow buffs to boycott Nolan's book and any conferences in which he was participating. <p> Nolan has endured, however, and his new book, <b>""Rally Once Again!""</b> is an indication of his continued place in the field of Civil War history as a sort of historians' gadfly: challenging, blunt, and always thought-provoking. This volume showcases his significant contributions to the field, spanning some 40 years, including book reviews, journal articles, forwards, introductions, and book chapters. <p> <b>""Rally Once Again!""</b> is divided into four parts: Leaders, Gettysburg, The Iron Brigade, and Selected Reviews. Most chapters concentrate on either Lee or the Iron Brigade, although there are also extended discussions of Lincoln, the Lost Cause, slavery, and the importance of the Civil War in American history. Throughout each piece, Nolan is remarkably consistent in his approach and analysis. A lawyer by profession, Nolan values careful research, objectivity, and clear writing. <p> Whether he is evaluating Lee's generalship, Lincoln's presidency, or the state of Civil War scholarship, he repeatedly reveals his impatience with myth and his faith in historical fact. On page <i>x</i> of the introduction, Nolan affirms: ""Contrary to the Hollywood and Margaret Mitchell image, I do not see the war as all romantic or glorious. It was in fact a grim and inhumane experience for the Americans involved, although its decisive results -- emancipation and the maintenance of the Union -- were positives. Other, indeed all, of the contentions of the Southern myth of the Lost Cause are also offensive to me and unhistoric. <p> Nolan expands on these statements in the collection's strongest essay, entitled ""Considering <i>Lee Considered</i>: Robert E. Lee and the Lost Cause,"" which was recently published in  <i>New Perspectives on the Civil War</i>. Here Nolan explains convincingly how and why popular conceptions of the Civil War have become so skewed and romanticized, despite significant strides made by recent historians to emphasize the War's horrors, restore slavery as the prime cause of the conflict, and acknowledge blacks as active participants in the struggle. Nolan's deep frustration is palpable on page 74 when he asserts: ""The legend seems to exist 'in our bones' and defeats the efforts of today's historians to set it straight."" <p> A collection such as this has its limitations. There is continuity, perhaps too much so considering the good deal of overlap from chapter to chapter. Nolan repeats the same statements and quotations in many of the pieces, including his view that Lincoln was a complicated man, but an uncomplicated president; Lee's 1864 pronouncement of an offensive grand strategy; Robert Penn Warren's statement that the Civil War is American history; and what Nolan deems as hasty conclusions about the first day of Gettysburg. The decision to include his introductions to other people's books seems a bit odd. These introductions are usually short and appear awkwardly out of context when reading them cut off from the books they originally preceded. <p> Readers may not always concur with Nolan, but few will find themselves uninterested in what he has to say. Alan Nolan is an historian not to be ignored.  <b>'Rally Once Again!'</b> is a valuable book recommended to anyone who relishes a stimulating discussion of the Civil War's contested meanings. <p> <i>Lesley J. Gordon, assistant professor of history at the University of Akron,is the author of</i> General George E. Pickett in Life and Legend <i>(1998) and co-editor of the forthcoming</i> Intimate Strategies: Marriages of the Civil War."	Gordon, Lesley J.

1916	700610499		Tom Taylor's Civil War		Castel, Albert			"Albert Castel has produced another fine book in <b>Tom Taylor's Civil War</b>, a close look at a field officer who served primarily with the 47th Ohio Volunteer Infantry in western Virginia and the Western Theater. Taylor would have remained obscure were it not for the hundreds of surviving letters that he and his wife Margaret, or ""Netta,"" exchanged, as well as his field-written journal entries. Castel culled those writings, publishing the best passages in their entirety while adding interesting transitions of his own that further explain the documents and assist in placing the correspondence in context. <p> The portrait that emerges of soldier Taylor is fascinating. He left his wife and two children on April 24, 1861, to enlist, driven to gain the martial success that had eluded his father during the Texas Revolution. Taylor fairly lusted after rank and prominence, and schemed to gain attention, promotion, and select duties. His missives often contain references to fellow officers who he believed were out to cheat him of his just rewards. <p> As impatient as he was ambitious, the Ohioan often carped at Netta for not writing frequently enough, then expressed remorse when bundles of her delayed letters arrived. Though many of his letters indicate a deep passion for his wife, it is also possible that Taylor was unfaithful to Netta during a visit to Nashville's notorious ""Smoky Row."" <p> Despite his shortcomings, Taylor was redeemed by his fine performance as an officer; his abundant leadership qualities quickly led superiors to entrust him with responsibility. He considered the welfare of his troops, and they in turn showed their appreciation, welcoming him with rousing cheers when he returned to the regiment from detached duty during the Vicksburg campaign. Taylor remained on duty when sick and fatigued, and was not afraid of the front line. He even lost a finger in an 1864 engagement. <p> The Buckeye gained the promotions he so coveted, rising from lieutenant to major and a staff position, and left the Union army in 1865 as a brevet brigadier general. He exemplified the high grade of citizen soldier that helped the North conquer the vast and rugged Western Theater. <p> Netta's writings also intrigue, as she often implores her husband to resign and return to Ohio, her sentiments echoing those of Southern women who bade their menfolk to quit the army for hearth and home. Taylor rebutted her arguments by citing a mix of personal and patriotic motivations for staying in the military. Netta's rare responses provide a glimpse into her struggles to maintain the family without her husband, and indicate the need for more study on the complexities of the northern home front. <p> The innovative Castel calls this book a ""biography,"" an apt term, for <b>Tom Taylor</b> tells us much more about its protagonist than do many compilations of period sources with a more traditional format. The Taylors' literate correspondence and their biographer's informative material combine to allow readers to gain an intimate portrait of what made one Union officer tick and the effect of his service on his family, as well as the internal workings of a regiment's command structure. <p>  <i>Dana B.

1715	802838723		Abraham Lincoln	Abraham Lincoln: Redeemer President	Guelzo, Allen C.			"Allen C. Guelzo's new book fills a distinct void in modern Lincoln literature: it is an authoritative and rewarding study of Lincoln's evolving relationship to God and to ideas. And while the character who emerges may be a less-than-great Emancipator, he is also a greater-than-ever Unionist, and a far deeper disciple of moral and political philosophy than previously imagined.<p>The author, who has written on both the evangelical movement and the Civil War, aims for ""something ... which virtually no modern Lincoln biographer has managed to do, which is to read Lincoln seriously as a man of ideas."" Guelzo does not ""baptize"" Lincoln ""literally or figuratively"" as a devout religious thinker. But he does invite modern readers to consider Lincoln's core beliefs as a ""bridge"" that may unite the mysterious personal side of the Lincoln story with the heroic public side.<p>Guelzo is at his most original setting the paradoxical Lincoln in the context of Victorian-era fixations on reason, economic rationalism, and natural law. As a boy, the author reminds us, Lincoln regularly attended church with his family, yet became more a doubter than a believer. Lincoln later famously refrained from joining churches either in Springfield or in Washington, inviting charges that he was an infidel.<p>He seldom invoked the name of Jesus Christ as Savior, though he did develop a growing respect for his Maker. Perhaps best defined as a religious fatalist, Lincoln was reverent enough to believe that ""the will of God prevails,"" but uncertain enough to wonder precisely what that will might be. In the end, as Guelzo very adroitly points out, Lincoln proved sufficiently independent to treat April 14, 1865, as the fourth anniversary of the fall of Fort Sumter, and not merely as Good Friday -- hence his decision to visit Ford's Theatre the night he was shot, rather than attend church. Guelzo is particularly good in recalling how much Lincoln's love for theater marked a ""departure"" from standard religious belief, which held the theater to be only slightly less hideous than hell itself.<p>Guelzo previously edited a reissue of J.G. Holland's <i>Life of Lincoln</i> -- notable for its claim that Lincoln was a ""true Christian"" -- and in a way, this book is Guelzo's expansive response. Certain of his chapters -- ""Whig Jupiter,"" ""Malice Toward None,"" and a fine epilogue -- ring with original thought and deft prose. In noting that Lincoln ad-libbed ""under God"" into the Gettysburg Address, for example, the author points out that while the president felt free to ""borrow the vocabulary of Christian re-birth as the scaffolding for the new national rededication, there was characteristically no effort on his part to import any formal recognition of Christian theology into that rededication."" We tend to forget what a departure such thinking represented among American politicians -- and how decisively Lincoln substituted the civic religion of the Union for the evangelical traditions of the culture.<p>Guelzo does make a few minor errors. Brooklyn was not, for example, a part of New York City when Lincoln was invited to speak at Beecher's Plymouth Church in 1860 (Greater New York was not formed until 1898). The Cooper Union Brady photograph was not full-length, but rather, three-quarter length. Lincoln told his wife of his dream of visiting the Holy Land before their last visit to the theater, not during the performance. And Lincoln posed for those haggard Alexander Gardner photos a month before his second inauguration, not a month after.<p>More importantly, one might reasonably disagree with the book's interpretation of Lincoln's reply to Horace Greeley's ""Prayer of Twenty Millions."" Guelzo thinks the famous piece ""impatient"" and ""coldly irritated,"" but more likely it was a shrewd public relations effort to make imminent emancipation palatable to a predominately racist North. Generally, Guelzo's treatment of Lincoln's slow, steady march toward emancipation is rich and intriguing, and alone worth the price of the book.<p>Guelzo is perhaps at his least convincing in his analysis of the Lincoln marriage. Here the author relies heavily on the earlier work of historian Michl Burlingame, to whom Guelzo acknowledges a large debt and a warm friendship. Burlingame's capacity for unearthing new sources informs this book, but his sometimes indiscriminate enthusiasm for everything he finds occasionally impairs it. And one cannot help wondering why an admirer of Burlingame, a noted stickler for high-sourcing standards, did not himself employ a more formal footnoting style for this book. I occasionally searched endlessly for sources and wished often for a more accessible system. Not often enough, however, to break the spell or mar the significance of this important new book.<p><i>Harold Holzer recently published </i>Lincoln as I Knew Him<i> and, with Mark E.

1085	1882810317		Triumph & Defeat: The Vicksburg Campaign	Triumph & Defeat: The Vicksburg Campaign	Winschel, Terrence J.			"Although much more important than the Battle of Gettysburg in determining the outcome of the Civil War, the Vicksburg Campaign has been the subject of far fewer books and articles. A three-volume  work by Edwin C. Bearss remains the only detailed study of the operations against the ""Gibraltar of the Confederacy."" In this book of essays, Terry Winschel explores several facets of the campaign.<p>""Unvexed to the Sea: An Overview of the Vicksburg Campaign"" briefly sets the stage for the essays that follow. In ""The Only Viable Option: Grant's March Through Louisiana,"" Winschel demonstrates the Union commander's audacity and boldness, which proved to be a prelude for the Federal campaign east of the Mississippi River. Grant chose a little-known, non-professional officer to lead an important cavalry operation because he saw Benjamin Grierson as daring and aggressive. ""Playing Smash with the Railroads: The Story of Grierson's Raid"" shows how the strike confused Confederate commander John C. Pemberton and cut vital Confederate supply lines.<p>Even after Grant and his army got across the vital river, they were not yet safe. In ""The Inland Campaign Begins: The Battle of Port Gibson,"" Winschel describes the Union victory in that engagement and shows how it allowed them to secure their foothold and forced the Confederates to evacuate the strategic position at Grand Gulf. The most decisive battle of Grant's campaign prior to the siege occurred at Champion Hill. ""Disaster and Disgrace: John C. Pemberton and the Battle of Champion Hill"" examines the fighting and describes Pemberton's utter incompetence as a field commander.<p>""The First Honor at Vicksburg: The 1st Battalion, 13th U.S. Infantry"" details that unit's part in the Union assault of May 19, 1863. The battalion placed the first national and regimental flags on the Confederate earthworks that day. Union engineers played a significant role in the siege, which Winschel summarizes in ""Spades Are Trump: Siege Operations."" He argues that the successful placement of Federal approach trenches near the Southern fortifications made the Confederate surrender inevitable. In ""Shut Up as in a Trap: Citizens Under Siege"" readers can get a fine picture of the hardships and privations of the city's residents.<p>Some historians have argued that the Confederates might have done more to hamper Grant's operations prior to his investment of Vicksburg. Winschel explores one of those possibilities in ""To Rescue Gibraltar: Efforts of the Trans-Mississippi Confederates to Relieve Fortress Vicksburg."" He presents the details of the surrender negotiations in ""Triumph and Defeat: Vicksburg Surrenders."" Winschel's ""Epilogue"" includes an assessment of the strategic importance of the campaign and summaries of the subsequent careers of many of the major players.<p>Winschel's essays read well and show his firm grasp of the many facets of the Vicksburg Campaign. The book contains a number of excellent maps and numerous illustrations. Anyone interested in the topic will enjoy this addition to the literature.<p><i>Arthur W.

2129	385491506		Polk's Folly: An American Family History		Polk, William R.			"Among the more prominent family names in American history are Adams, Lee, and Roosevelt. Aside from the notice given to 19th century expansionist president James K. Polk, the surname Polk has failed to receive comparable historical attention. Historian William R. Polk is out to end this oversight in a new family history entitled <b>Polk's Folly</b>. Delivering more than a simple family tree following the exploits of his ancestors, the author, by placing the reader close to each member of the Polk family and to the perils that were faced and often overcome, contributes to a comprehensive understanding of our nation's history. <p>The story of the Polk family in America begins with Robert Pollok, who fled England after the Restoration of Charles II. Trying his fortune in the promise of the new world, Robert found himself on Maryland's Eastern Shore a century before the American Revolution. Names like ""Polk's Folly"" and ""Damned Quarter"" attest to the difficult conditions he faced in the unknown land. Sons and grandsons of Robert fared better, starting new lives in search of opportunity closer to the Appalachian Mountains. There Robert Polk's grandsons, Thomas and Will Polk, became involved in the political battles that led to the American Revolution, as well as in the debates between Federalists and Republicans.    <p>This participation in politics carried over to perhaps the best known of the Polk clan, the 11th president of the United States, James Knox Polk. As chief executive during the critical war with Mexico, Polk committed the United States to continental expansion in the Southwest, a policy that fueled the sectional differences that ultimately resulted in the Civil War. His presidential diary represents an amazing record that attests to his micromanagement of executive matters during the White House years. The president literally worked himself to death by keeping long hours and agonizing over the most trifling details. Within a few months of finishing his term, he succumbed to cholera at the age of 54.<p>Students of the Civil War will also recognize the name Leonidas Polk, a West Point graduate and later Episcopal bishop of the Louisiana territory who, after repeated pleas by Jefferson Davis, accepted command of the Confederate forces assembling in Mississippi. There Leonidas faced an untested Ulysses S. Grant in the opening battles of the Western Theater. Scouting William T. Sherman's lines outside Chattanooga in 1864, Leonidas was killed by an enemy cannon shot. In a strange twist of fate, distant relative William Harrison Polk, fighting for the Union, stood only a few yards from the field piece directed at Leonidas. In succeeding generations, members of the Polk family included a leader of the Populist party, an acting secretary of state, a tank commander in Europe during the Second World War, and a civil rights attorney.    <p>Reading <b>Polk's Folly</b>, one appreciates the impressive amount of contextual information that Polk provides in his narrative. The scarcity of family records in the opening chapters makes this a necessity. In the absence of writings from the Polks on first impressions of the New World, the author utilizes the utopian texts of Sir Thomas More and the propaganda of Richard Hakluyt as background information. Polk continues this practice throughout the rest of his book, offering vignettes on contemporary topics such as the first party system and presenting a charming portrait of the antebellum South. <p>Throughout the book, the Polks are confronted with choices and themes we commonly associate with the unfolding story of America: the promise of the West, the lure of big profits, and the agonizing decisions made in war. Whether discussing the Populist movement or American diplomatic affairs, Polk strives to place the reader close to each of his subjects. There, weaving primary sources with those of contemporaries, he affords readers the opportunity to better understand the historical setting of each of his family members. Especially touching are the letters that Jimmy Polk, a tank commander in George Patton's Third Army, scribbled to his wife, discussing the burdens of ordering men into dangerous battles. <p>More than an exploration into William R. Polk's roots, <b>Polk's Folly</b> is an obvious labor of love, proving that the evolution of the United States can be charted through the adventures and escapades of unique individuals in a matchless family. In the end, Polk has given us a lively and readable account of our nation seen through their eyes.<p><i>James Mac Donald is currently working toward his Ph.D. in American history at Louisiana State University.</i>  <p>"	Mac Donald, James	Spring 2000	2000-03-01	Review	A tale of one family's intersection with history	Sons of liberty	Doubleday	0000-00-00				"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=249 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/WilliamPolkPolk'sFolly.jpg"">"					
1893	684863650		Eye of the Storm: A Civil War Odyssey		Sneden, Robert Knox		Bryan, Charles F.	"Among the soldier-artists who created a contemporary pictorial account of the  Civil War, Robert Knox Sneden was almost certainly unique. With the publication of <b>Eye of the Storm</b>, an edited version of his illustrated wartime diary, Sneden should now be placed in the front ranks of Civil War artists. <p> Born in Nova Scotia, Sneden worked as an architectural and engineering draftsman in New York City before enlisting in the 40th New York Volunteers (the ""Mozart Regiment"") in the summer of 1861. Initially a quartermaster, Sneden was soon shifted to mapmaking, and did useful and sometimes dangerous duty in that capacity during the Peninsula campaign and at Second Bull Run. <p> With few exceptions, Sneden's duties were at first safe and relatively easy, but all that changed in November 1863, when he was captured by John Singleton Mosby near Brandy Station, Virginia. From that time until his exchange two years later, Sneden's war became a nightmare. Sent first to Richmond, he and his fellow prisoners-of-war were then transported by cattle car to a newly created prison called Andersonville. Sneden and his contingent were among the first of what would later swell to 33,000 Union prisoners jammed into the notorious Confederate stockade. <p> Throughout his service in Virginia and later in a succession of horrible Rebel prison camps, Sneden kept a diary and made the richly detailed drawings we would expect from an engineering draftsman. Like his prose, Sneden's images of buildings and terrain are precisely rendered, with an emphasis on clarity and completeness. He mailed the diary entries and drawings home whenever possible; in prison, he hid them in his clothing and shoes. After the War, he rewrote and refined his wartime journals, fleshing them out with historical accounts taken from other sources, and coloring the drawings he had made in the field, perhaps with an eye toward publishing his own personal history. <p> The Virginia Historical Society acquired four albums of Sneden's drawings and maps in 1994, and later tracked down and purchased five more volumes containing nearly 5,000 pages of Sneden's diary and even more watercolors. From this mass of materials, editors Charles F. Bryan, Jr., and Nelson D. Lankford selected passages from the diaries to reconstruct a contemporary record (thereby rejecting the sections of text based on Sneden's secondary, postwar sources) and chose an appropriate number of colored illustrations. <p> This is quite simply a wonderful book. Sneden's vividly descriptive prose brings to life the messy, chaotic, and sometimes humorous stories of men at war. One can virtually hear the soldiers snoring and the mules braying. Something of a cynic, and a perfect example of the survivor who did what was necessary to get through the War, Sneden didn't leave us a rosy view of the conflict. Especially moving is his account of the horrible months he spent in Andersonville, a personal story calculated to ruin anyone's romantic reveries about the Civil War. <p> Sneden's all-observing eye was truly ""in the storm,"" and his belatedly published memoir should soon become a standard in the field. <p> <i>Ben L. Bassham, emeritus professor of art at Kent State University, is the author of</i> Conrad  Wise Chapman, Artist and Soldier of the Confederacy (1998), <i>for which he recently won the first Henry Timrod Southern Culture Award.

1923	1574882767		Under Custer's Command: The Civil War Journal of James Henry Avery		Husby, Karla Jean	Wittenberg, Eric J.		"Amongst the vast literature related to the Civil War, studies of George Armstrong Custer rank high as a recurring theme for exploration. Now another pair of books-<b>One of Custer's Wolverines</b> and <b>Under Custer's Command</b>-has been released that add to this extensive body of information. <p> Both titles deal with troopers who followed Custer in the famed Michigan Cavalry Brigade. But there are many other ties between the works. <p> First, Eric J. Wittenberg, an Ohio-based attorney and a founding member of the Civil War Cavalry Association, edited the pair of accounts. Wittenberg has produced other publications related to his favored topic. In fact, two of his earlier efforts, <i>Gettysburg's Forgotten Cavalry Actions</i> and <i>""We Have it Damn Hard Out Here"": The Civil War Letters of Sergeant Thomas W. Smith, 6th Pennsylvania Cavalry</i> speak to his knowledge of mounted forces during the 1861-65 period. Consequently, Wittenberg would seem a logical candidate to undertake the editing of subsequent volumes about Union and Confederate cavalry operations. <p> Furthermore, in his latest efforts Wittenberg turned to Temple University's Gregory J.W. Urwin for forewords and also consulted with Brian C. Pohanka. These individuals enjoy highly respected positions in Civil War circles. Finally, Wittenberg twice drew upon Blake A. Magner's cartographic skills for simple, yet effective maps depicting various battles and campaigns discussed in the respective texts. <p> Despite these similarities there also are many differences between the new publications. For instance, <b>Under Custer's Command</b> reflects the perspective of an enlisted man, James Henry Avery, an Ohio farmer with presumably a limited education. Avery kept a diary of his service with the Fifth Michigan Cavalry, and later used it when producing the memoir under review here. Conversely, <b>One of Custer's Wolverines</b> deals with an officer, James H. Kidd, who rose from lieutenant to colonel during the war. Kidd was a student at the University of Michigan when he ended his academic pursuits to join the Sixth Michigan Cavalry. His level of education along with a subsequent career as a journalist ideally positioned him to produce a literate reminiscence of his wartime experiences. In 1909, Kidd's  <i>Personal Recollections of a Cavalryman in Custer's Michigan Brigade in the Civil War</i> was released, and subsequently was reprinted four times. The volume, according to Urwin, ""ranks as a classic, one of the richest and most reliable accounts of Union cavalry operations in the Eastern theater."" <p> Dozens of letters Kidd sent home during the war likewise survived. This correspondence and other papers, now held by the Bentley Historical Library at the University of Michigan, served as the impetus for <b>One of Custer's Wolverines</b>. Urwin's foreword to this title contends it ""will take its place alongside Kidd's <i>Personal Recollections</i>. . . ."" <p> Such praise from a scholar whose own  <i>Custer Victorious: The Civil War Battles of General George Armstrong Custer</i> has become a standard in the field, should indicate the merit of <b>One of Custer's Wolverines</b>. Despite these supportive words and Urwin's further statement that ""Wittenberg has woven his subject's observations into a fascinating narrative,"" the volume exhibits certain shortcomings. <p> Indeed, rather than offering a seamless narrative, Wittenberg's commentary on each letter is stitched together with Kidd's correspondence in a patchwork manner. This is not always so, as seen on pages 67-68 where Wittenberg's succinct introduction and postscript provide the proper context for Kidd's account of life in winter camp during 1864. Elsewhere, however, in cases where their content offers little information relevant to the flow of the story, some letters might have been better left out or paraphrased. <p> Another problematical aspect of the book has to do with the use of notes. These appear at the end of the text, thereby requiring the reader to jump to another section of the book, and, even then, the notes sometimes lack citations and generally provide little more than the full name of an individual mentioned in the letters. <p> In other places, content notes about such conventions as prisoner exchanges or paroles would have been helpful to individuals not as familiar with the subject as Wittenberg is. Moreover the content of some notes might have better served the audience had it been placed in the body of the text. Also, in a few instances there are tantalizing references to Kidd's ""Reminiscences of a Volunteer"" from the <i>Ionia Sentinel</i>. These undated clippings from Kidd's hometown Michigan newspaper may well have been the basis for his 1909 book, yet Wittenberg does not attempt to establish this possible connection. Nor did he evidently make an effort to ascertain whether a run of the paper existed to provide accurate dates for the scraps his researcher copied from the Bentley Library collection. <p> In another note found on page 217, the editor states that the Powder River Expedition undertaken during the summer of 1865 was ""remarkable"" in its similarity to the failed 1876 Little Bighorn campaign. Actually, the two incidences were only superficially alike, the major distinction being the outcome of the clashes: the troops and their leader in 1865, Brigadier General Patrick Connor, emerged from fighting against the Sioux with few casualties whereas Custer and his Seventh Cavalry suffered a very different fate. Wittenberg not only acknowledges this fact in the text, but also repeats the same conclusion in the accompanying note-thereby contradicting his interpretation of these distinctly different engagements. If anything, the situation for Connor's force more closely paralleled Custer's strike at Washita than it did the Little Bighorn. <p> These issues aside, the last chapter of <b>One of Custer's Wolverines</b> is representative of the book's real merit: the many insightful elements found in Kidd's previously unpublished letters. Those written after Lee's surrender particularly are strong, demonstrating that not all troops went home immediately after fighting ceased. Much to their chagrin, men in some volunteer units, including the Sixth Michigan, were sent to the West as a force against American Indians in the region. Of course, others went south as an army of occupation with the opening of Reconstruction. <p> In the final analysis, <b>One of Custer's Wolverines</b> will appeal to enthusiasts who share Wittenberg's fervor for cavaliers in blue and gray, and be a resource for future authors writing about Custer and Civil War cavalrymen. For a general readership, however, Edward G. Longacre's  <i>Custer and His Wolverines: The Michigan Cavalry Brigade, 1861-1865</i> or Wittenberg's second new editorial undertaking, <b>Under Custer's Command</b>, should prove more satisfying. <p> The latter publication is a collaboration with Karla Jean Husby, the descendant of a veteran of the Fifth Michigan Cavalry. As Gregory Urwin's foreword indicates the volume is ""more than a notable historical resource. It is even more than a good read."" In fact it is a revealing account by Sergeant James Avery that in some respects is nearly as compelling as the timeless  <i>Hardtack and Coffee, or the Unwritten Story of Army Life</i> by John D. Billings. <p> Assuming Avery's great-great granddaughter was faithful in the transcription of her ancestor's papers, this straightforward saga of life in the saddle is an extraordinary, candid glimpse of the dangers of combat and intimate details of routine life between campaigns. Avery's writings essentially stand on their own merit, although Wittenberg's editorial efforts, which in this volume are placed conveniently on the page where the corresponding reference appears, add to the published account. Wittenberg makes corrections to the old trooper's occasionally faulty memory, fills in basic facts, and provides contextual elements. The result is a worthy addition to any well-rounded Civil War library. <b>Under Custer's Command</b> promises to stand the test of time long after many other works have been forgotten. <p> <i>John P. Langellier received his Ph.D. in military history from Kansas State University.

Nor did he evidently make an effort to ascertain whether a run of the paper existed to provide accurate dates for the scraps his researcher copied from the Bentley Library collection. <p> In another note found on page 217, the editor states that the Powder River Expedition undertaken during the summer of 1865 was ""remarkable"" in its similarity to the failed 1876 Little Bighorn campaign. Actually, the two incidences were only superficially alike, the major distinction being the outcome of the clashes: the troops and their leader in 1865, Brigadier General Patrick Connor, emerged from fighting against the Sioux with few casualties whereas Custer and his Seventh Cavalry suffered a very different fate. Wittenberg not only acknowledges this fact in the text, but also repeats the same conclusion in the accompanying note-thereby contradicting his interpretation of these distinctly different engagements. If anything, the situation for Connor's force more closely paralleled Custer's strike at Washita than it did the Little Bighorn. <p> These issues aside, the last chapter of <b>One of Custer's Wolverines</b> is representative of the book's real merit: the many insightful elements found in Kidd's previously unpublished letters. Those written after Lee's surrender particularly are strong, demonstrating that not all troops went home immediately after fighting ceased. Much to their chagrin, men in some volunteer units, including the Sixth Michigan, were sent to the West as a force against American Indians in the region. Of course, others went south as an army of occupation with the opening of Reconstruction. <p> In the final analysis, <b>One of Custer's Wolverines</b> will appeal to enthusiasts who share Wittenberg's fervor for cavaliers in blue and gray, and be a resource for future authors writing about Custer and Civil War cavalrymen. For a general readership, however, Edward G. Longacre's  <i>Custer and His Wolverines: The Michigan Cavalry Brigade, 1861-1865</i> or Wittenberg's second new editorial undertaking, <b>Under Custer's Command</b>, should prove more satisfying. <p> The latter publication is a collaboration with Karla Jean Husby, the descendant of a veteran of the Fifth Michigan Cavalry. As Gregory Urwin's foreword indicates the volume is ""more than a notable historical resource. It is even more than a good read."" In fact it is a revealing account by Sergeant James Avery that in some respects is nearly as compelling as the timeless <i>Hardtack and Coffee, or the Unwritten Story of Army Life</i> by John D. Billings. <p> Assuming Avery's great-great granddaughter was faithful in the transcription of her ancestor's papers, this straightforward saga of life in the saddle is an extraordinary, candid glimpse of the dangers of combat and intimate details of routine life between campaigns. Avery's writings essentially stand on their own merit, although Wittenberg's editorial efforts, which in this volume are placed conveniently on the page where the corresponding reference appears, add to the published account. Wittenberg makes corrections to the old trooper's occasionally faulty memory, fills in basic facts, and provides contextual elements. The result is a worthy addition to any well-rounded Civil War library. <b>Under Custer's Command</b> promises to stand the test of time long after many other works have been forgotten. <p> <i>John P.

2201	1581570112		A Time of War: A Northern Chronicle of the Civil War		Murray, Stuart			"An ancient, gigantic elm tree, the pride of Pittsfield, Massachusetts, was felled in the town square in the summer of 1864 when the risk of falling limbs finally outweighed the protective esteem the citizens held for it. The elm's fate symbolized dramatic changes for the people of Berkshire County during the Civil War, as recounted by Stuart Murray in <b>A Time of War</b>. <p> Mostly rural Berkshire County produced one complete infantry regiment (the 49th Massachusetts Volunteers) and hundreds of soldiers who served in a dozen other state regiments. Some of the Bay State's great war heroes called Berkshire home, or had strong ties there, including Brigadier General William F. Bartlett of Pittsfield, and frequent visitors Robert G. Shaw of the 54th Massachusetts Infantry and Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. of the 20th Massachusetts. Murray follows these and several less notable characters (including two Berkshire emigrants who served as officers in the Confederate armies) throughout the war. <p> An equally important theme is the home front. Murray brings to life the pageantry and patriotism of small New England towns as they recruited and equipped local boys to save the Union. Here lived the aged author and philanthropist Catharine Maria Sedgwick, and Herman Melville, who wrote stirring verses on the triumphs and sufferings of Union soldiers as he sulked over the initial failure of <i>Moby Dick</i>. Murray lavishes his work with contemporary poetry, especially Melville's, to excellent effect. Berkshire County prospered during the war as manufacturers expanded to meet the demand for military materials. But there was a dark side, too, not limited to the grievous casualties Berkshire men suffered at Gettysburg and at the Wilderness. The gruesome murder of a mother and her two children that shocked the county in 1862, and an epidemic of arson suggest deep social stresses, perhaps brought on or exacerbated by the war. <p> Murray does not examine these issues deeply, preferring the role of chronicler to that of analyst. His narratives of the battles and campaigns Berkshire soldiers participated in fit the purpose well, though some of his interpretations are suspect. In summarizing the battle of the Wilderness, for instance, he writes that ""Lee had held his ground against Grant's frontal attacks"" when, of course, it was Grant who more significantly held his ground against Lee's flank attacks. He also accepts uncritically the view of Reconstruction as a time ""when much of the South was looted by unscrupulous 'carpetbaggers' from the North."" <p> Despite these drawbacks, <b>A Time of War</b> is a thoroughly engaging book that sheds light on the changing conditions of life on the home front. Murray's work should interest not only the people of western Massachusetts, but all who are curious about the interactions between the northern home and battle fronts. <p> <i>Jeffrey D.

1858	1560252596	$16.95	Blood: Stories of Life and Death from the Civil War		Kadzis, Peter			An installment of the Adrenaline Series, edited by Clint Wallis, <b>Blood</b> brings together excerpts from fiction and nonfiction stories of the life and death struggle that was the Civil War. Of the 20 chapters that make up the anthology, four are selected from famous pieces (Michl Shaara's <i>The Killer Angels</i>, Stephen Crane's <i>Episode of War</i>, Sam Watkins's Co. <i>Aytch</i>, and Shelby Foote's <i>Shiloh</i>), three are by female writers, and the rest from letters, diaries, and memoirs. The excerpts are just about evenly split between the North and the South. <p> The anthology touches on nearly all aspects of the conflict. Pieces from <i>A Confederate Girl's Diary</i> and <i>The Diary of Caroline Seabury, 1854-1863</i> provides an accurate depiction of the home front on both sides. The African-American involvement in the War is reflected in Thomas Wentworth Higginson's well-known <i>Army Life in a Black Regiment</i> and the slavery issue in the lesser-known <i>Before Freedom, When I Can Just Remember</i> by Adeline Grey. <p> Peter Kadzis, an experienced professional journalist and editor, constructs the bulk of his book with action stories told by participants whose viewpoints cover the entire chain of command, from Berry Benson's <i>Civil War Book</i> to Ulysses S. Grant's <i>Memoirs and Selected Letters</i>. Each chapter is preceded by a short paragraph describing the writer and his role in the struggle, accurately placing the piece in the wider context of the War. <p> Each piece was selected for its intensity, describing a particular action or the writer's feelings toward the issues that embroiled him in the epic struggle. One of several examples is Abraham Lincoln's letter to James C. Conkling, written after the president's Emancipation Proclamation and just before the Gettysburg Address, in which Lincoln expresses his war aims in a few brilliant pages. Another is Grant's description of the events surrounding Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House. Having written perhaps the best memoir of the conflict, Grant's graceful prose underscores the respect he had for his opponent and the importance of treating the affair with dignity. <p> Kadzis has taken the time to sort through the enormous amount of literature published about the War Between the States in order to present a one-volume work with the most vivid and poignant of those writings. There are perhaps no surprises among the selections for the well-read student of the War, yet they serve as reminders of its effect on people past and present. For the new recruits, <b>Blood</b> does its duty as a good starting point for the study of primary literature. <p> <i>David Lee Poremba is a librarian/archivist at the Burton Historical Collection, Detroit Public Library and the author of several pictorial works on City  of Detroit history.</i>	Poremba, David Lee	Summer 2000	2000-06-01	Review	An anthology poignantly depicts battle and home front	Their finest hour	Thunder's Mouth Press	36647			anthology, fiction, blood, Kadzis	"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=232 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/PeterKadzisBlood.jpg"">"

Naron recounts such espionage activities as burning Confederate railcars, supplying faulty intelligence, and chasing down Union deserters, all the while feigning allegiance to his Southern brothers.

2062	089096923X		Brush Men and Vigilantes: Civil War Dissent in Texas		Pickering, David	Falls, Judy		"Awful things may be done by neighbor to neighbor in the pressured midst of civil conflict. In the southern states during the Civil War, citizens were persecuted sometimes because they did not show enough enthusiasm for -- or outright opposed -- the Confederate cause. Self-styled defenders of civil order often struck out against enemies to settle old scores, or acted out of the fears of unrest that war caused. In their fine effort at reconstructing the tragedies of internal civil war in northeast Texas, David Pickering and Judy Falls have written a chilling tale of wartime murder and revenge. As such, <b>Brush Men and Vigilantes</b> adds to growing evidence of civil war within the Confederacy, where guerrillas fought loyalists and where neighbor fought neighbor.<p>The authors begin their tales of wartime hangings in northeast Texas by describing the land and the settlers who lived through that ordeal. Northeast Texas, covered with thickets and river bottom, was settled by people from the upper and lower South. Although hard conditions made making a living difficult, some became successful cotton planting, slave-owning Confederates, whereas the more modest yeoman farmers resisted secession. Old land owning and family feuds resurfaced among those different classes and led to the nightmare of murder in the name of self-protection and defense of the southern cause. <p>The hanging of five men from two families -- the Hembys and the Howards -- by vigilantes is the centerpiece of this well-researched book. Through that event, as reconstructed from eyewitness accounts, the reader sees the fear slaveowners had of any voice that supported reunion. The Hemby and Howard account is contrasted with that of other atrocities, used to show how at war's end unionists would attempt revenge, and finally linked to how descendants of those men have blotted that horrible scar from their family history.<p>Family differences and feuds are the reasons why the Hembys and Howards had to flee their homes. When they returned to harvest their corn crops they were set upon, forced to flee into Jernigan's Thicket, tricked into surrendering, given a false trial, and summarily hanged for treason, simply because they had refused to support what they believed was an illegal and irresponsible Confederate government. The authors contrast those hangings with that of Martin Hart, who had left Texas and joined the Union army. Operating as a guerrilla warrior, Hart marauded in northwest Arkansas, and northeast Texans believed him headed home to disrupt slavery. The vigilantes, supposedly acting under Confederate authority, arrested and hanged Hart and one of his lieutenants. <p>The story did not end there, as friends of Hart who had supported him also were tried and hanged. One, Austin Glenn, died merely because his link to Hart was an excuse for revenge against him personally. As the War came to an end, Frank Chamblee, a friend of the Hembys and of Hart, was hunted down in a thicket and shot, probably because he  had humiliated the vigilantes by avoiding arrest and living right under their noses.<p>During the early days of Reconstruction, when military authority had collapsed and civil leaders had not yet assumed power, other atrocities were perpetrated over wartime grievances, and became acts of revenge. Pickering and Falls also point out that friends of the Hembys and Howards sought to prosecute the vigilantes for their murders. A former sheriff, members of the so-called home guard, and Knights of the Golden Circle, all successful cotton planters, were hauled into court. But Governor James W.T. Throckmorton, a former unionist who had joined the Confederacy, made certain those ""patriots"" never came to trial. Friends of the hanged unionists, however, tracked down one of the hangmen some years later and killed him.<p>At the turn of the century, E.L. Dohoney, an acquaintance of the Hemby and Howard families, left a memoir of their murders, but it was relegated to the dustbin of history, an embarrassment to the citizens of northeast Texas. Other ex-unionists had long left Texas to avoid further persecution, or out of fear of having their names linked with those hanged as traitors, thus taking their truth with them. As legends of a united Confederacy grew, to remember a divided wartime Texas filled with such atrocities was forbidden. Even the Hemby and Howard descendants were led to believe that the men had been terrorists. Besides, they insisted that their ancestors had been killed in some other state. It is to the credit of Pickering and Falls that the truth of what happened to three Hembys and two Howards in 1862 in northeast Texas, and others there later, in that war of fear and retribution, is now no longer hidden from history.<p><i>Jon L. Wakelyn, professor of history at Kent State University, is author of nine books, most recently </i>Leaders of the American Civil War, Southern Pamphlets on Secession: November 1860-April 1861<i>, and </i>Southern Unionist Pamphlets and the Civil War<i>.

1845	811714519		The Right Hand of Command: The Use and Disuse of Personal Staffs in the Civil War		Jones, R. Steven			"Behind every successful general lies a good staff. Staff development has accompanied the evolution of the profession of arms, and today's revolution in military affairs (the impact of the Information Age) seems unlikely to change that dependency. Yet professional military staffs emerged more quickly in Europe than in the United States. For what they called staff work, American commanders relied much longer upon themselves, a small coterie of family and friends, or a sprinkling of junior officers. Prior to the Civil War, that staff work mostly comprised clerical duties and messenger service. <p> Staff functions today are clearly defined to include gathering and evaluating information, preparing detailed plans, translating a commander's decisions into orders, and transmitting instructions to subordinate elements of the command, as well as specialized administrative, operational, or logistical duties. Such things are second nature to staffers from the Pentagon down to the field level. Not so during the Civil War era, as shown in the work of R. Steven Jones, assistant professor of history at Southwestern Adventist University. <p> <b>The Right Hand of Command</b> picks up where J. Boone Bartholomees, Jr., left off in <i>Buff Facings and Gilt Buttons: Staff and Headquarters Operations in the Army of Northern Virginia, 1861-1862</i>. Jones, however, concentrates on the development of personal staffs for four specific field commanders rather than on a general history of how officers added special staffers to handle ordnance, subsistence, medicine, transport, etc. The appeal of Jones's work lies with its integration of the specific personalities and command functions clustered around Generals Lee, Sherman, McClellan, and Grant. The results may surprise readers. <p> Lee, a former staff officer himself, made the least use of a four-man staff that included the able Robert G. Chilton. Sherman, too, believed in a small staff. Jones observes that neither general used his staff ""in any but the traditional functions of writing and delivering orders."" McClellan, possibly the most versed of the four in European staff development, remained hesitant about transferring those lessons to America. He did employ his capable father-in-law, Randolph B. Marcy, as an important link with Washington. Only Grant built a professional staff between the time he was expeditionary force commander in 1862 and general in chief during the last year of the War.  <p> Jones believes that it is impossible to know if Grant's staff system ""hurried the end of the Civil War."" He simply suggests that Grant saw a need, and alone among the four found a creative way to fill it using an organizational element available to all Civil War generals. Grant created a modern staff ""and made it his right hand of command.""  <p> In the end, Jones concludes that three factors governed Civil War personal staff employment. They were army size (the larger the force, the greater the need for staff help), cooperative operations (independent forces operating toward common objectives), and a commander's willingness to improve staff work. If a general saw no real benefit in staff work then neither the presence of large army nor the plan for cooperative operations could encourage him to improve that staff work. <p> Can we be sure that the examples of Lee, Sherman, McClellan, and Grant were at all typical? Adding other important ""case studies"" of generals like Winfield Scott, William T. Sherman, George H. Thomas, Albert S. Johnston and Joseph E. Johnston, Braxton Bragg, or even Union naval commanders like David Porter and David Farragut might have further confirmed Jones's thesis. <p> Still, <b>The Right Hand of Command</b> introduces a less-noticed cast of characters surrounding the stars, thereby offering a new approach to Civil War command and control. To answer just how truly influential as opposed to merely useful aides were to commanders will require an expanded effort to study staff experience below major command. Was staff evolution a handmaiden of the industrialization of war or merely a whim of the individual in charge? <p> Noting that the Civil War was hardly without innovations in staff structure, Jones nevertheless remarks that advances in this area were not permanent - there was no organized plan or process to modernize staff work throughout the United States (much less the Confederate) army during the War. Demobilization returned the American military to its small budgets and limited role in national defense. Even Grant did nothing to institutionalize his experience. Such modernization awaited the 20th century. <p> <i>Benjamin Franklin Cooling is Professor of Grand Strategy and Mobilization with the Industrial College of the Armed Forces, National Defense University, Washington, D.C.</i>"	Cooling, Benjamin Franklin	Summer 2000	2000-06-01	Review	Grant's innovative staff structure went unimitated by other generals	Staffing the War	Stackpole Books	36647				"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=247 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/RStevenJonesTheRightHandofCommand.jpg"">"

1402	1557508445		Confederate Admiral: The Life and Wars of Franklin Buchanan	Confederate Admiral: The Life and Wars of Franklin Buchanan	Symonds, Craig L.			Biographies of Civil War era naval officers are a scarce commodity and those of Southern officers are most rare. Craig L. Symonds has created a superb piece of writing in <b>Confederate Admiral</b>, his new volume on the life of Franklin Buchanan. The result is an impressive telling of the life of the Confederacy's first admiral. This work will be the seminal history of Buchanan.<p>Historians and enthusiasts of naval engagements of the Civil War know Buchanan as the captain of the C.S.S. <i>Virginia</i> at Hampton Roads and also of the C.S.S. <i>Tennessee</i> at Mobile Bay. Buchanan and Raphl Semmes are perhaps the most recognized naval officers that served in the Confederate navy. More has been written about these two men than all other Confederate naval officers combined. What has been lacking, particularly in the case of Buchanan, is a true biography and Symonds now has succeeded beautifully in writing it.<p>Buchanan's service as an American naval officer, a career that spanned 50 years, was remarkable. He began as a midshipman on the <i>Java</i>, a square-rigged frigate, and later commanded the coal-fired side-wheeler <i>Susquehanna</i>. He was the first commandant of the U.S. Naval Academy, the first American to set foot on Japanese soil, and the commander of the first U.S. flag vessel to sail up the Yangtze River in China.<p>Buchanan, assuming his native Maryland would secede as a slave-holding state, resigned his commission after Sumter. When Maryland stayed in the Union, he tried to get his commission back, and, when this effort failed, he joined the fledgling Confederate navy and became one its great strategic architects. Buchanan's prowess as a naval tactician is covered in detail. He was an innovator serving in a naval service that desperately needed him. After the War he returned to his Eastern Shore home, the Rest. He served as president of the Maryland Agricultural College in 1868-69. He died at his home on May 11, 1874.<p>What clearly emerges from this work is Buchanan's attitude toward politics, slavery, life in the upper South, and the angst of serving two masters -- his country and his region. The book contains excellent photographs, engravings, and maps, and the scholarship is first rate.<p><i>Gary D.

1398	1882810236		Lee's Last Major General: Bryan Grimes of North Carolina		Allen, T. Harrell			Bryan Grimes was a successful planter in Pitt County, North Carolina, when the Civil War began. An avowed secessionist, Grimes voted in the convention for his state's withdrawal from the Union and  then resigned his political position to serve in its and the Confederacy's defense. Unschooled in military matters, he would by war's end rank as a major general with a fine record as a combat officer in the Army of Northern Virginia.<p>T. Harrell Allen, head of the Department of Communications at East Carolina University, offers the first biographical study of one of the Confederacy's finest examples of a citizen-soldier. Utilizing the correspondence of the Grimes family and numerous other manuscript collections and published works, Allen has written a solid biography of both the man and the soldier. The book is detailed, judicious, and reads well.<p>Although a widower with two young children, Grimes never hesitated to embrace North Carolina's call for volunteers. <p>Appointed major of the 4th North Carolina Infantry, he learned the elements of soldiering, emerging rapidly as a no-nonsense officer. He believed in discipline and passionately supported the cause. When his time came to lead men into combat, he displayed a remarkable skill for handling troops on a battlefield and an unflinching personal bravery.<p>Grimes fought with his men on nearly all of the major battlefields in the East. Throughout the four years, he earned praise from superiors, endorsements from his men, and promotion to higher rank. Promoted to major general on February 15, 1865, Grimes was the last officer accorded that rank in the renowned army. He commanded a division until the end at Appomattox.<p>At war's end, Grimes returned home, and like thousands of his comrades, had to begin again amid the ashes of a lost cause. He had remarried during the war, and he, his wife, and children eventually returned to Grimesand, the family plantation. He farmed, perhaps joined the Ku Klux Klan, and on August 14, 1880, with a son by his side, was killed by an unknown assassin. He died within minutes.<p><b>Lee's Last Major General</b> fills a gap in the historiography of Lee's lieutenants. The author quotes extensively from Grimes's letters and renders a balanced portrait of the subject. It is a good book, but one which could have benefitted from the services of a proofreader or editor. Dozens of grammatical and spelling mistakes mar an otherwise fine narrative.<p><i>Jeffry D.

2227	820320463		A Consuming Fire: The Fall of the Confederacy in the Mind of the White Christian South	Consuming Fire: The Fall of the Confederacy in the Mind of the White Christian South A	Genovese, Eugene D.			"By the Christian South, Eugene Genovese means virtually the whole white population of the region. Catholics and Protestants are included with little attention to differences between them or to distinctions between the numerous sects of Protestantism. While representations of the squirearchy, the yeomanry, and the poor whites are not ignored, it is the ruling class that receives major attention and highest regard in these pages.<p>About the Old South's rulers Genovese wrote back in 1968 that they were ""class conscious, socially responsible, and personally honorable."" He found it hard to ""condemn as immoral those who behave responsibly toward their class instead of someone [else's]. . . . If we blind ourselves to everything noble, virtuous, honorable, decent, and selfless in a ruling class, how do we account for its hegemony?"" <p>Thirty years later he seems to hold pretty much the same view of that class. In the few references he makes to their bourgeois counterparts up North, he is less generous both to them and to their doctrine that ""time is money.""<p>Not that our historian regards Southern society as flawless or its rulers without their own moral dilemmas and failures. In fact, the problem of slavery is the central concern of his new book. The defense and justification of slavery involved not only the ruling class and slave owners but, with the exception of the few emancipationists, the whole society. Involved in the ongoing defense were representatives of all its articulate components -- intellectuals, poets, novelists, journalists, politicians, and most prominently, the clergy of all denominations. It was only natural that a society of white, churchgoing, pious worshipers should look to their ministers and priests for guidance in matters of such gravity. <p>Genovese's thorough and scholarly search of their published sermons, and theological and philosophical writings, persuade him that the Southern clergy and theologians were almost unanimous in their support of slavery. Furthermore they relied almost entirely upon the Holy Scripture in their defense of the insti-tution -- the unquestionable ""Word of God."" <p>The lawfulness of slavery thus was no more questionable than the existence of God. In citing Abraham and Old Testament patriarchs as slaveholders they also won the support of Southern Jews. Christians were reminded that Jesus and the Apostles never preached against slavery and that it was money changers, and not slaveholders, that Christ drove from the temple.<p>Southern divines did not sanction evil<p>But how could Southern divines sanction the appalling evils of slaveholders? The answer is they did not. While they agreed that the institution had divine approval, the obedience demanded from slaves was balanced by an insistence that slaveholders were charged by God's word with ""Christian responsibilities"" towards their servants -- including restraint in use of powers so often abused.<p>Increasing numbers of clerics preached reforms calling for the right of slave marriage, the integrity of slave families, and repeal of laws against slave literacy. They were able to touch some uneasy consciences, but the risks of reformers were too daunting for many, especially after slave revolts and plots spread fear and trembling.<p>Politicians, parsons, and the ruling class searched God's word in vain for support of states' rights and secession, but their people sprang to arms with firm conviction that God was on their side in the war for independence. Confederate victories were interpreted as gifts of God; defeats as His punishment for sins. Religious revivals swept the ranks and conversions soared when prospects turned bleak.<p>One Confederate general in a post-war lament declared, ""I think it was a serious incubus upon us that during the whole war our president & many of our generals really and actually believed that there was this mysterious Providence always hovering over the field & ready to interfere on one side or the other, & that prayers & piety might win its favor from day to day."" Faith in divine favor prevailed to the end, and defeat was believed to be God's will.<p>The fall of the Confederacy, as Genovese says, ""proved traumatic for the white Christians of the South."" There was no one explanation. A Presbyterian minister declared it ""the only inexplicable anomaly of history."" Many thought it God's punishment, not for slavery per se, but for man's abuse of it. One woman declared it the result of too much faith in General Lee and too little in God. Anyway, it was God's will. As one Virginian taunted the Yankees, ""After all, it was not you but God that abolished slavery. You were mere instruments to do his work.""<p>Two recent articles from Germany have compared that country's guilt over Nazi atrocities with the defeated South's sense of guilt over slavery. Too recent for Genovese's notice, it is nevertheless clear that he would have none of that comparison. Admitting that a few slaveholders may have professed guilt for failing to live up to standards of Christian slaveholding and that able scholars have held that many Southerners tormented themselves with guilt for owning slaves, he argues that ""the mass of the slaveholders -- and non-slaveholders for that matter -- accepted slavery as ubiquitous in history, as sanctioned by Scripture, and as a fact of life.""<p>If accepting defeat was traumatic for Confederates, making peace with their conquerors would prove as bitter for true believers. Churchmen resisted submission to free-labor capitalism and the hated bourgeois social order that they blamed for all the evils the Confederacy had risen to oppose. For divines, this included the North's scientific racism that clashed with religious orthodoxy in denying that blacks and whites were a single species and teaching polygenesis and a subhuman status for blacks. <p>Granting that the slave trade was of capitalist origins, Genovese holds that slaveowners did their utmost to garb slavery in traditional and modern defenses. He is pleased to report that ""slaveholders read with respect socialists . . . although, to their cost, they did not know Marx, and like the socialists, they assumed that . . . capitalists simply could not provide the stewardship of labor of which Christian capitalists might aspire.""<p>Conforming to the social order of the victor<p>Despite all their contorted ideological defenses, their complicated theological defiance of the Antichrist, their ghastly war casualties, and their bitter determination never to conform to the social order of the victor, Southerners did gradually, reluctantly, and sadly conform. As our historian puts it, they ""found themselves enmeshed in a materialistic, marketplace society that promoted competitive individualism and worshiped Mammon.""<p>There were, after all, aspects of the new order that proved useful in dealing with new Southern problems. Racism and white supremacy had a strong appeal for employers seeking to control the new freedmen. White supremacy and racial segregation were useful to politicians seeking to divert poor white voters from radical demands. Lynching protected white womanhood and stopped ""mongrelizations."" Unemployed masses of whites eagerly sought jobs at any wages in the new mines and factories that capitalist carpetbaggers opened. Churches capitulated to segregation throughout society as well as to black disenfranchisement and racist politics. Some brave clergymen resisted, but New South editors and orators drowned them out with their championship of the values of a triumphant Yankeedom.<p>Surely we have in this small volume a remarkable and important contribution to Southern history during its most critical period. It is written with intellectual rigor and impressive scholarship. Agree with the author's interpretations or not -- his book belongs on the required reading list of all seriously interested in Southern history.<p><i>C.

1492	895871777		Freedom's Altar	Freedom's Altar	Price, Charles F.			"Charles Price catapulted to the attention of Civil War readers three years ago with <i>Hiwassee</i>, an unusually well-received first novel that is based on the wartime experiences of his Southern Appalachian forebears and buttressed by an authenticating mastery of such documentary sources as editor Walter Clark's 1901 <i>North Carolina Regiments, 1861-1865</i>, plus the mammoth <i>North Carolina Troops, 1861-1865</i>, a series edited by Weyland T. Jordan, Jr., of that state's archives and history division.<p>In fact those readers were so enthralled by <i>Hiwassee</i> that it earned Price, a former Washington lobbyist for the aviation industry, the reputation of a spellbinder in the realm of Civil War fiction. Happily, the reading pleasures crafted into <b>Freedom's Altar</b> both confirm and deepen that reputation. And for those left longing for a sequel at <i>Hiwassee's</i> end, yes, the new novel is just that.<p>It's not a Civil War novel as such, however, since this time the assured storyteller's time frame is the era immediately following the war. During this time western Carolina and north Georgia -- the mountainous terrain of the war's mayhem-wreaking Bushwhackers -- were perhaps even more treacherous as Unionists, ""secesh,"" and the region's comparatively few ex-slaves grappled with how to accommodate themselves to a totally rearranged world that few had any experience, and indeed, often any inclination, to face.<p>Nevertheless <i>Hiwassee's</i> successor is again centered by Madison Curtis, the aristocratic, meticulously honorable paterfamilias of a once affluent clan, and Oliver Price, a yeoman shoemaker from the Georgia hills who left behind a devoted wife and young son to valiantly acquit himself at Vicksburg and elsewhere across the South in ""a rich man's war, a poor man's fight.""<p>A longer, more complex novel, <b>Freedom's Altar</b> expands its cast of central characters to include another diverse, memorable pair. By name these are Nahum Bellamy, a Radical Republican apostle (with a darkly shadowed war record) and demagogic Freedmen's Bureau ""Boss,"" who is singularly driven by a lust to avenge Curtis's class of Southerners by any means necessary, including murder, and Daniel McFee, a recently returned Union soldier affectionately known to Judge Curtis as ""Black Gamaliel"" when master and slave worked side-by-side on plantation tasks in antebellum times.<p>Postwar, McFee sharecrops on a small farm portioned off from the wrecked plantation by his former owner. Andy, the oldest of three Curtis sons, is the sole survivor among them of the Confederacy's defense. He is compelled by fate to abandon his family-pet softness for a take-charge role (in tandem with Oliver Price, a friend from the war) when Bellamy, initially idolized by McFee, begins to press a legal claim against the judge by an illiterate mother-daughter duo of white mountaineer squatters. <b>Freedom's Altar</b> introduces Hamby, the runaway mulatto son (by a previous master's scion) of McFee's late and greatly beloved wife, now back in the mountains as a Bellamy toady and rider in his Seraphim posse of ""police.""<p>So in part this gripping, hard-to-put-down novel is about father-son and other male relationships. But despite the friendship that McFee and the judge rebuild and strengthen, overarchingly this novel is about tragically squandered opportunities to begin the process of racial reconciliation in the war's embittered aftermath.<p>""When the war ended,"" McFee realizes as he begins to perceive Bellamy's actual intent, ""the Rebels all seemed to admit their guilt and bend their necks to the all-conquering Union. . . . But as the months passed and the lenient terms of the peace sank in, they began to see that nearly all whites North and South shared the same dread of black folk and so shared an interest in keeping them down. Thus the serpent of rebellion once more raised its head, and the Rebels began to dream again their evil dreams of white supremacy and the oppression of the Negro.""<p>And near the elegiac sequel's close, the senior Curtis agonizes, ""Extreme opinion has carried the day on all sides, I'm afraid,"" adding, ""I see nothing ahead of us now but division and hate. . . . I fear the two races can never be reconciled but instead will be forever at odds. And the pity of it is that we might have averted it, had we only been men of better character.""<p>Such insights, of course, are unlikely to endear <b>Freedom's Altar</b> to ""lost cause"" romanticists, even if its phonetically rendered dialogue often lapses closer to Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind than, say, Charles Frazier's more recent Cold Mountain, a novel similarly set in time and place to Price's continuation. But don't be deterred by these perhaps persnickety comparisons. To be sure, Price's stellar creation is to be relished for its own beauties of prose. Indeed, the unforgettable final scene pierces the heart.<p><i>Bob Summer is Southern correspondent for</i> Publishers Weekly<i> and president of the Southern Book Critics Circle.

1846	807125598		Ellet's Brigade: The Strangest Outfit of All		Hearn, Chester G.			"Chester G. Hearn is a prolific writer who has published an astonishing eight books in the past five years. Most of these concern naval aspects of the Civil War, and five of them, including this one, deal with the war on the Mississippi. <b>Ellet's Brigade</b> is the history of a curious - even bizarre - command that Hearn in his subtitle describes as ""the strangest outfit of all."" <p> The command of Charles Ellet, Jr., was not really a ""brigade"" at all except in name. It began in 1861 when Ellet, a 51-year-old engineer and bridge builder, tried to convince Navy Secretary Gideon Welles that a squadron of fast, unarmed river steamers, used as rams, could defeat conventional river warships. Welles was skeptical of both the idea and its progenitor, and rejected the proposal. But Ellet found a more receptive audience in Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, who gave the eager but militarily inexperienced Ellet his chance. <p> Ellet purchased four side-wheel steamers (adding more later), reinforced their prows with heavy timbers, and took them to war, choosing several of his relatives as officers. Because his small squadron did not fit into the command structure of either the army or the navy, Ellet was practically his own master and virtually able to do whatever he wanted. Despite his command of warships, he bore the rank of colonel, though most of the time he disdained any uniform and wore civilian clothes on the bridge. His initial conception of a proper tactical doctrine for his rams was that they should smash themselves sacrificially into enemy gunboats on what amounted to suicide missions. Understandably, both the navy high command and many of those Ellet sought to recruit looked upon this whole enterprise with considerable skepticism. <p> Nevertheless, at the Battle of Memphis in June 1862, Ellet's unusual and aggressive tactics appeared to be justified when he charged past the U.S. Navy gunboats of Union Flag Officer Charles Henry Davis and into the midst of the enemy squadron, sinking the two largest Confederate gunboats and damaging others. Ellet received a leg wound in that battle and subsequently died of blood poisoning. Control of the ram fleet then devolved onto his brother Alfred, who was in command of the <i>Queen of the West</i> when it rammed the Confederate ironclad <i>Arkansas</i> under the guns of Vicksburg in July 1862. (Though William ""Dirty Bill"" Porter later claimed credit for the destruction of that vessel, Hearn argues that the critical blow was struck by the <i>Queen of the West</i> when, in the initial collision, it damaged the <i>Arkansas's</i> connecting rods, the subsequent failure of which forced the Rebels to abandon and destroy the vessel themselves.) <p> When David Dixon Porter took command of the Mississippi River Squadron that fall, Lincoln placed the ram fleet under the senior Porter's control. As compensation, Alfred Ellet was promoted to brigadier general, and saw to it that his teenage nephew Charlie became a colonel. Charlie took over command of the ram fleet while Alfred busied himself organizing a force dubbed the ""Marine Brigade."" The idea here was similar to current doctrine in the U.S. Marine Corps: an amphibious assault unit continuously embarked and therefore ready to descend at a moment's notice on an enemy position. Today this is called a Marine Amphibious Unit (MAU); Alfred Ellet called his command the ""Mississippi Marine Brigade."" <p> Alas, from this point on, the story loses some of its cohesiveness. Charlie Ellet's rams participated in a number of expeditions up the Yazoo and Red Rivers as well as on the Mississippi, but they did so as part of larger expeditions. The young colonel attempted to duplicate his uncle's feat by ramming the Confederate gunboat <i>City of Vicksburg</i> below the city, then incautiously ventured up the Red River where he ran his vessel aground and had to abandon it. That was pretty much the last independent action by the ram fleet, for Porter viewed Ellet's command not as a distinctive unit, but as a useful group of auxiliary vessels best used for transport or scouting. <p> In the latter half of the book, Hearn focuses increasingly on Alfred Ellet's Marine Brigade, which, like the ram fleet, tended to act independently. If 19-year-old Charlie was young and irresponsible, his uncle Alfred Ellet emerges in this narrative as unskilled and unreliable, even cowardly. He had trouble from the outset. Recruiting was difficult because service in his unaffiliated command did not count against the state quotas in the conscription bills. As a result, he had to make promises to his recruits that he could not keep: no marching, clean beds, hot meals, etc. Once organized, his command of just under 1,200 men spent most of a year rampaging up and down the Mississippi, achieving little besides infuriating the locals, stealing cotton, and often running away at any sign of serious resistance. <p> The value of Hearn's coverage of these events is that it reminds us that the Civil War did not consist of a number of famous set-piece battles with long uneventful periods in between. Along the Mississippi, as elsewhere, it was a constant war of skirmishes and ambushes. In that war, Ellet's Brigade contributed little. The conclusion of Assistant Secretary of War Charles A. Dana was that Ellet's Brigade was ""a very useless as well as costly institution,"" and a contemporary newspaper reported, all too accurately, that Ellet's men ""were generally where they were not wanted and seldom at hand when needed."" <p> The story of the creation and demise of this curious command offers insight into the ad hoc nature of the Union mobilization in the early years of the War. It was created in the first place due to the aggressive politicking of Charles Ellet, and subsequently sustained largely out of inertia. Hearn is a good storyteller, though the second half of the book lacks the narrative unity of the first. One other problem with the book is that its maps are all reprints of earlier, public domain sources and often do not include sites that are named in the text. Nevertheless, Hearn's many recent contributions, including <b>Ellet's Brigade</b>, successfully re-focus attention on the many-faceted naval side of the Civil War, including the conflict on the western rivers. <p> <i>Craig L.

1765	767902815		Gob's Grief		Adrian, Chris			"Chris Adrian's debut novel <b>Gob's Grief</b> is not so much a book about the Civil War as it is about how people cope with the terrible loss and grief caused by the war. It is a book not of battles and generals, but of spirit voices, regret, and madness. <p> A postwar America riven by social upheaval, reevaluation of accepted values, and radical politics provides the setting for the suffragists, spiritualists, and walking wounded who populate the book. Walt Whitman is at the spiritual center of their audacious effort to undo the war's devastation. He establishes the tone of wistful sadness that propels the first chapters, in which he works to comfort wounded soldiers at the army hospitals in Washington City. During a visit to New York City in 1868 he befriends a brilliant young doctor, George Washington ""Gob"" Woodhull, who is consumed with grief over the death of his brother in the war. <p> Gob, in turn, befriends Will Fie while the two are studying medicine at New York's Bellevue Hospital. The men belong to a ""not very exclusive club of surviving brothers""-Will also has lost a brother to the war and suffers the same survivor's guilt that drives Gob to madness. While a soldier in the Union army, Will takes up with a French photographer who follows the army like a vulture, making photographs of the battle carnage. After the Frenchman is killed, Will inherits a grisly collection of photos that so sensitize him to the world's ills that he begins to see ghosts all around him. Will thus is a natural recruit to Gob's project: a machine that will resurrect all the dead from all wars. <p> What Gob manufactures is a ""great nonsensical conglomeration of mechanical parts that sat under an enormous telescopic gaselier...glass tubes and iron gears, steel ribs, yards and yards of twisting, wrist-thick bundles of copper wire, here and there a bone."" One part looks ""like the gate to Greenwood Cemetery, complete with a gatehouse, and the whole thing sheltered under a pair of wings"" made from the photographic negative plates that contain Will's horrifying images of the war. <p> Maci Trufant is the last active ingredient added to this volatile mix. She is a suffragist who works for Gob's mother, the radical feminist Victoria Woodhull. For Gob, however, science rather than politics is his religion and his way of dealing with loss. He has become a doctor because he is obsessed with death. While initially repelled by Gob's work, Maci eventually is drawn into the resurrection effort (she, too, lost a brother to the fighting) yet remains the practical one among the three-Maci recognizes that the crazy endeavor is mostly about keeping the dead from being forgotten. She ultimately makes sense out of Gob's struggle against death and offers hope for the future as well as a way to reconcile the living with the dead. <p> Adrian is a medical student whose work has appeared in <i>The New Yorker, Paris Review</i>, and <i>Story</i> magazine. His writing in <b>Gob's Grief</b> can be beautiful and evocative at times, with compelling characters and strong attention to historical detail. Adrian's talent for breathing life into odd characters as well as his skill at painting a compelling portrait of the time make him a writer to watch. However, each character's story is told in fragments and vignettes that diffuse any dramatic tension. The parallel histories of the characters not only tend to confuse, but Adrian settles for an ending that is too enigmatic to be satisfying, thereby weakening what is otherwise a strong first effort. <p> <i>Don Evans is a newspaper editor and the author of</i> Locust Alley: A Novel of the Civil War (2000)."

1803	395867606		Controversies & Commanders: Dispatches from the Army of the Potomac	Controversies & Commanders: Dispatches from the Army of the Potomac	Sears, Stephen W.			"Civil War historians have discovered once again the power of essay collections. Whether multiple-authored under an editor's guiding hand, or created by a single accomplished writer like Stephen Sears (as in the case of the present volume), they nearly always provide new wine for old vessels. In short, they yield distinctively focused snapshots of particular themes, events, or person'. Sears thus joins other recent vintners like Gabor Boritt, Gary Gallagher, James McPherson, and Steven Woodworth in selecting an area where talent and interest combine to give us new thoughts and dimensions of some exciting issues. In Sears's case, the theme concerns controversial leadership in the Army of the Potomac.<p>Sears's forte is ""Mr. Lincoln's Army,"" although his principal concentration in the past has been the rather formative period of that military instrument. Readers will immediately associate his name with the study of the archetypical controversial leader George B. McClellan and the Peninsula and Maryland campaigns in which the general figured so prominently. More recently, Sears has expanded his field of vision to include Chancellorsville and the juxtaposition of Joseph Hooker with the immortal Lee and Jackson as battlefield and army commanders.<p>Now, in <b>Controversies & Commanders</b>, the author uses ten distinctive essays to dissect this phlegmatic army's performance and response to a variety of leadership styles and personalities. Fully half the chapters refer to the early period of the army's existence. And again, as might be expected, the leitmotif remains the preeminent <i>minence grise</i> -- McClellan, his presence, his influence, and his legacy.<p>Sears commences the journey with an analysis of how historians have handled ""Little Mac."" He follows that introductory essay with chapters defining the September 1862 campaign which saw McClellan's restoration to army command over the opposition of virtually everyone in Washington (with even Abraham Lincoln less than pleased with his own necessary decision). Sears then contributes some ""last thoughts"" about the famous Lost Order of the Maryland campaign in which he advances how, if nothing more, the finding of Lee's campaign plan decidedly affected the unfolding of events.<p>Additional chapters illustrate McClellan's influence over events and people as Sears describes the sacking of relatively obscure Brigadier Charles P. Stone (for the Balls Bluff debacle) and better known corps commander Fitz John Porter (for noncooperation with Pope at Second Bull Run). In both cases, he implies, their association with ""Little Mac"" contributed to their demise with the army.<p>Next comes an especially winsome piece on ""the Revolt of the Generals"" against Ambrose Burnside that plays back to the continuing existence of McClellan's ""old boy network,"" which plagued a continuously unsuccessful army. One wonders if the Army of the Potomac ever truly overcame its ""infatuation"" with this wannabe American Napoleon. That the Union finally did so is suggested by Sears's handling of the lingering ghosts of McClellan. Sears puts them to rest in one sense as he leaves us with the perception that by re-reading McClellan's own words, we can finally decide whether a McClellan victory at the polls in 1864 and elevation to the presidency six months later would have appreciably changed the vigorous prosecution of the Union war effort to ultimate suppression of the rebellion. He concludes that ""Little Mac"" as well as Lincoln saw subjugation of the Confederacy as the ultimate war aim. Of course, their methods differed substantially.<p>When Sears turns to the middle and latter periods of the Army of the Potomac's mottled history, he uncovers several episodes of note, but possibly loses an opportunity to explore and explain better the army's singularly unsung but possibly most intriguing commander. True, Sears does a superb job of rehabilitating ""Fighting Joe"" Hooker from some unjust criticism. He sees the cannon ball-disabling of the army commander as more instructive in explaining Chancellorsville than any preemptive brilliance of Lee and Jackson. <p>Less controversial will be his chapter about the ineptness of that quirky politico-general Dan Sickles, whose claim to rank and reputation was forever washed away by the bloodbath on the second day at Gettysburg. It is here, however, that Sears fumbled a golden opportunity to include something major about General George Meade, although the Pennsylvanian remains the butt of Sickles's postwar efforts at rescue and redemption in the Sickles chapter. We simply need to know more about Meade and the late-war army in a period largely made obscure by the presence of General-in-Chief Ulysses S. Grant travelling with the Army of the Potomac and rendering some rather controversial decisions on its behalf.<p>Sears concludes his volume with several episodes that suggest the presence of controversial leadership still apparent in the late-war army. A vignette of the very questionable sacking of corps commander Gouverneur K. Warren by Grant and his favorite, Philip Sheridan, (apparently with Meade's acquiescence) is particularly striking. But, this was certainly a classic reflection of organizational management response between ""old"" and ""new"" -- the clash of Western and Eastern army generals and their military style and culture. Sears could have amplified the incident in that context, rather than merely emphasizing late-war injustice to a loyal subordinate like Warren.<p>The hour was late, the conflict needed termination, and men like Grant and Sheridan could brook no further lethargy in a vigorous thrust to the hilt. Warren seemingly reflected the Army of the Potomac's traditional inability to administer any <i>coup de grce</i>. An example had to be set -- no matter that the individual's previous service was exemplary. Perhaps the damage was so slight because Appomattox loomed so near.<p>Sears's seeming genuflection to the arms and services that undergirded the Army of the Potomac comes in a chapter examining the tangential but controversial raid on Richmond, which was engineered by the questionably competent Judson Kilpatrick and his Byronesque subordinate, Ulric Dahlgren, largely for the purpose of kidnapping Jefferson Davis and attacking the Confederacy's central nervous system. What it all amounted to was quite divorced from the main operations of the Army of the Potomac and spoke more to a bizarre late-war twist of spawning a ""get the king"" game -- which, of course, eventually resulted in Lincoln's assassination.<p>Surely some other examination of use or misuse of Eastern cavalry or even artillery -- or better, a consideration of the logistical branches of the army's overall performance -- would have made for a more rounded treatment. But, of course, such topics might be less entertaining and might potentially contravene Sears's avowed theme of controversies and commanders. Best that they be left to another place and time no matter how much better they might inform us of the war machine that was the Army of the Potomac.<p>How then to assess Sears's effort? Comfortably documented, it provides readers with an unshowy, crisp book that should delight the Round Table set and students of the War in the East. The work needs maps since much of the discussion relates to operations as well as personalities. Most certainly, <b>Controversies & Commanders</b> speaks to the topics clearly enunciated in earlier years by Bruce Catton -- the political machinations, the controversial helmsmanship, the notoriety of the middle rank figures as well as the principal field force of the Union ""that could have lost the war in a single afternoon."" That Sears's work has seemingly downplayed (if not omitted) the central role of Lincoln in ""Mr. Lincoln's Army"" needs to be clearly understood. But, here is an easily read, enjoyable jaunt that will complement the work of Noah Trudeau, Gordon Rhea, and others who continue to find stimulating themes in the campaigns from the Mason-Dixon line to southside Virginia in the battle for the capitals.<p><i>Benjamin Franklin Cooling, author or editor of numerous works of Civil War, military, and naval history, is professor of grand strategy and mobilization at the Industrial College of the Armed Forces of the National Defense University in Washington, D.C.</i>"	Cooling, Benjamin Franklin	Fall 1999	1999-09-01	Review	McClellan, his friends and foes, and Union Army squabbles	American Napoleon	Houghton Mifflin	0000-00-00				"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=241 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/SearsControversiesCommanders.jpg"">"

3711			<p>CIVIL WAR TREASURES: </p>Blue Bayou<br>New York private participates in Banks Expedition		Jewett, Leah Wood			Collection: Abraham Garrison letters, Mss. 4035, Louisiana and Lower Mississippi Valley Collections, LSU Libraries, Baton Rouge, La. Size: 20 items.<h3>New Acquisitions in the </h3><h3>Louisiana and Lower Mississippi Valley Collections</h3><h3>LSU Libraries' Special Collections</h3><br><p>Abraham Garrison was a private in the 161st New York Infantry, Company A. The regiment was organized in 1862, and took part in the Banks Expedition. Married with two young children, Garrison spent the duration of his service in Louisiana. Though the Abraham Garrison letters make up a relatively small collection (20 documents รป most of which are written from Garrison to his wife, Lydia), they present a poignant vignette of the war on a personal scale. </p><p>Garrison writes to his wife, Lydia, about frequent illness among the troops and notes the presence of starving children and adults in Baton Rouge: </p><p><blockquote>This city has no one in it except some few old white men and women but negroes by the thousand, starved and naked and bare foot. White folks the same--they have nothing except a little corn meal and that is one dollar a peck...but what hurt me the worst was to have the little children to run up to me and ask me for some hard crackers. I gave as long as I had any. That made me think of home (December 22, 1862).</blockquote></p><p>In a clear example of racism among the Union ranks, Garrison writes to his friend, Robert, about his disgust for black Union soldiers, and mentions a rumor that Confederate forces at Port Hudson have sent black soldiers to attack the Union regiments just south of the area.  </p><p><blockquote>They have been fighting-- this is the third day. Down the river about nine miles we could hear them run plain. We look for our turn next. The rebels are plenty here. I was on picket the other night and in the morning we saw about 35 of guerillas a looking for pickets but they didn't get no shots nor we either. We have a large army here, there will be big tearing about here or somewhere's else before long, I can smell it now. But let it come, we are here first. But the worst of all we have two negro regiments, that makes me sick. If our folks can't lick the South without negroes they had better give it up. But after all the South has got four regiments of negroes that they have sent down from Port Hudson to attack us...there is about 4000 of them here now and I would like to see all of them in the middle of the river (February 10, 1863).</blockquote></p><p>The letters include pleas for information on livestock and crops at home, as well as instructions to his wife on how to manage the property and the harvest. Garrison repeatedly insists that he does not owe money to neighbors who seek to take advantage of her financially while he is away:</p> <p><blockquote>You spoke to me about Owen Borden's boy--I don't owe him anything. Don't you pay everything that comes up because they think that they have a good chance to plunder now because I am gone. They all would take the last cent from you. Don't you pay a cent to anyone till you hear from me. That 30 acres of land that Adison boughtรนdon't you pay a dime on it for I done more work on that then all the stuff ever come to... Adison ain't as honest as I took him to be...Lydia, you had better sell what little you have got left before they steal it all from you (February 13, 1863).</blockquote></p><p>Outraged at the poor treatment of privates, Garrison laments the war and those who profit from it, When I think it all over we are used worse then the negroes that are here (February 13, 1863).</p> <p> <blockquote>It is very sickly here now, the hospitals are full but they die off so that it gives others a chance to come in. When they die they throw them out on a  stoop and they lay there [wh]ile a cart comes along and takes them away.  A man has got to have a heart like a stone to stand what he sees...</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>...I want this war stopped as quick as possible for I think it is the most corrupt thing that I ever knew. It is nothing but a speculation for the big officers. They don't try to do anything. They don't care for a man['s] life then I would for a chicken (March 5, 1863).</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>This war is the greatest humbug that ever was. It's to make money on negroes. The officers don't care; they live well and plenty of whiskey and the poor privates has to suffer. I wish the whole of them was in the Mississippi (April 17, 1863).</p></blockquote><p>With assurances of his eminent recovery, Garrison describes a recent illness:</p><p><blockquote>I caught a heavy cold. I have been in the hospital ever since about five weeks but don't be alarmed. I am coming up all right again. I shall go to camp in a few days. I thought I would not lie to you, I would tell you just as it was. I would of wrote to you before but I thought I wait till I got about well first. In this hospital lice is no [illegible]; they are so thick on some of them that it puts me in mind of [peasants?] carrying their eggs off. I caught two fine fat fellows on me. They die off fast here they can hardly get lumber enough for coffin (April 17, 1863).</blockquote></p><p>Several weeks later Garrison describes his experience amidst the Siege on Port Hudson:</p><p><blockquote>Lydia my dear we have been a fight[ing] about eight day and it is awful. We all lay about three hundred yards from the fort. We fight every day. We have not [captured] the fort yet but we expect to have it every day. this I write on the battlefield. We have lost a number of men out of our regiment now and wounded...We have a large force about 40 thousand and artillery...Port Hudson is considered one of the hardest places we have to take. ...Lydia you know a man in this place can't think of much the cannon is a roaring so that you can't hear nothing...the bullets fly so that we have to lay behind trees to save our heads (June 2, 1863).</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>We made a charge on Port Hudson on the 13th but was repulse[d] and such a slaughter I never saw but we held our old ground yet there will be another charge today or tomorrow. This will make three charges. We have been fighting for the last three or four weeks. Banks will never leave till it fall. They have so much of the advantage of us (June 16, 1863).</blockquote></p><p>And finally, Garrison writes of victory:</p><p><blockquote>This battle is one of the hardest battle that has been fought in this department, so they say....we have got Port Hudson at last and we all marched through it and it was a sight to see. What a stronghold they had there. We was sent from there to Fort Butler that is between Baton Rouge and New Orleans. Fort Butler is a very nice little fort close to the river. The Rebs attacked them there and mister Rebs got licked nice. Lost 1000 men I suppose that was what sent us there. We landed here on the 10th of July. We laid here over night and the next morning marched up the bayou about 5 miles and drove the Rebs before us. We made a stand over night and the next morning the fight commenced they had a large force and they was too much for us but now back to the 161st. Until the order came fall back, we fought all the way back. We had a small force. They had about 14 thousand men. Our regiment lost about 73 men killed, wounded, and missed. Our regiment is a getting small now, we have about 200 men now. ...the damn Rebs left, we don't know where they have gone nor don't care. We have got the old Mississippi clear. There was a boat came down the other day from St. Louis it made great hurrah (July 17, 1863).</blockquote></p><p>On January 14, 1863, Garrison wrote to his wife Lydia about his deepest fears:</p><p><blockquote>But hope that God may spare my life to come back home. I never want to be laid here. I want to be laid where my family is laid but I am too far from home. I am more afraid of sickness then I am of bullets.</blockquote></p><p>Less than two months after Garrison's last letter on August 9, 1863, a message was sent to Lydia from the General Hospital in Baton Rouge. Garrison had died of typhoid fever and dysentery on September 17, 1863; he was buried in Baton Rouge at a site later designated as a National Cemetery. </p><p>Note: Spelling and punctuation have been standardized in the Garrison letters for this article.</p><br><i>About the photographs:</i><p>On the cover:<p>Baton Rouge National Cemetery postcard, ca. 1906.

<p>
Historians estimate that more than 5,000 Louisianians enlisted in Louisiana Union regiments. Most of these men were immigrants (German and Irish), and many had been previously impressed into Confederate service (Hunter 189). Once New Orleans fell in 1862โthanks in large part to these men and their less than enthusiastic support for the Confederacy1โmany enrolled in Union regiments, motivated both by sentiment and salary (Hunter 186, 190).</p>
<p>  
During federal occupation of the city General Nathaniel Banks, following in his predecessor Benjamin Butlerโs footsteps, worked to raise loyal units to protect the area.  The 1st New Orleans Volunteer Infantry was organized in March 1864. Made up of โmainly of Crescent City immigrants and southern Mississippi farmers"" (Hunter 207) the mission of the unit was, explicitly and exclusively โthe protection and defense of New Orleans"" (Current 92). Other occupations represented in Company D of the unit include cooper, musician, shoe maker, paper vendor, and laborer. According to the records in the Charles W. Boothby Papers, several men were transferred to the unit from the 6th Michigan Heavy Artillery, while others had been previously enlisted in the 1st Louisiana Infantry (Union).  At least one soldier in the company was listed as having been โgained by desertion.""</p>
<p>
The task of recruiting troops for the 1st New Orleans Volunteers fell, in part, to Charles W. Boothby, Captain, Company D. Born in 1837 Boothby was a teacher by profession; in 1861 he enlisted as a private in the 12th Maine Infantry Regiment, and was promoted  to lieutenant.  The organization of the 1st New Orleans Volunteers gave Boothby the opportunity to rise in rank.</p>
<p>
Though scant, the Charles W. Boothby Papers at Louisiana State Universityโs Hill Memorial Library offer the only significant collection of records pertaining to this guard unit.  Military records, coupled with Boothbyโs personal correspondence, help piece together the experience of a white Union regimentโmen who lived in Louisiana but chose, for a variety of reasons, to serve the Union.</p>
<p>
In a letter to his younger brother, George, Boothby describes his new found duties:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Headquarters, First New Orleans Volunteers,</p>
<p>
Corner Claiborne and Canal Streets,  [Woodโs Press building]</p>
<p>
New Orleans</p>
<p>
January 16, 1864</p>
<p>
Brother George:</p>
<p>
Your kind letter of date about Christmas was duly received and I now attempt to answer it, together with those you had previously written, as you assert, although I have not been far in the arrears in answering letters until recently; for the past two months I must plead guilty of neglect โ in writing, but will endeavor to make up for past-negligence. I do not know that this will reach you directly, not knowing that you are in the vicinity of home.  Almira F. wrote me that you that day commenced your school but did not say where. I will direct the letter home and you will probably get it some time.</p>
<p>
Well, here I am still in New Orleans, and I think destined to remain in it โ a long while yet. My health is very good indeed.  I reside in the city and have for two months past. I left the Q.M. Dept. at Lakeport to go into the 1st N. Orleans Vols. In which regiment I am now an officer. For the past two months I have been recruiting for the regiment and as recruiting is very dull, it has taken a long time to get enough men for an organization. As you would like to know all the particulars in regard to the regiment, and my interest in it I will tell you. Three months since Genโl  Banks authorized the raising of the regiments of infantry โfor protection and defense of New Orleans"" one (the 1st) to be stationed in the city for guard duty, and the other(2d) to be stationed at Carrollton. The enlistment papers expressly state that their services are limited to the โDefenses of New Orleans,"" and they will not see service unless the city should be attacked, which is very improbable yet it takes more than one regiment to do the guard duty of the city. Barracks have been built expressly for the regโt โ exceeding in neatness and comfort any that can be found in the country. The uniform differs from others as they are raised for a special duty. Our regiment โ the 1st- commanded by Col. C. W. Killborn now numbers about 300, which are now being organized into small companies to go on to duty as guard. Recruiting is slow; I do not know whether a draft will be ordered or not; the enrollment is made but the military authorities hope to get men by volunteering. At the commencement of the movement I was told by Col. Killborn that if I would go to recruiting I should have a position in the regiment. I did so, and yesterday received from General Banks a captainโs commission in the 1st N. Orleans Vols. The first captainโs commission issued to the regiment. It strikes me that it is quite a jump from the rank of private to captain. By the paper I send, you will find a publication of the issue of the commission with others. My application was for a 1st Lieut, but the military board of examination before which I was called recommended me after examination, to Genโl Banks for a Captaincy; I think it quite a compliment when I consider that many were rejected. But I have not fully decided to keep the commission for this reason: although an officer may be mustered 1st Lieut. Unless there should be a draft it would take me two months to get my men to be mustered captain, and living at one dollar per day for board, what I have paid for more than two months past โ I feel like getting under pay soon as possible. I may decide to have my commission revoked, and be mustered as 1st Lieut. Commanding company. I have been boarding until the present. The Adjt. Of the regiment and myself have now rented a neat two story house โ have furnished it enough for comfort โ have my servant โAunt Hester,"" a steady old colored woman, one of the best cooks in the city or any other, and we live comfortably and independent โ We are master of our own house and it seems more homelike. Of course our duties are with our regiment, but that is not every day, and our house is but a few steps from the headquarters of the regiment. The Adjt.โs sister is coming out here to stop with use. If Lizzie would like to come out here she can come now, and have a good home, for I shall be settled here until the war closes. I would like to have her come. It is not much of an undertaking to come to N. Orleans, and probably she could get a school if she wished one โ wonder how she would like a colored school; they are established here now  - many northern ladies are taking darkie schoolsโฆ</p>
<p>
โฆSome of them learn remarkably fast โ and some of them are blockheads. Lizzie might come if she would; nearly every officer stationed here has some of his friends here from the North โ indeed a large number of the ladies seen on Canal St. โ the fashionable St. โ are northern ladies. โ you can know them; only โYankees"" have those brown straw bonnets, with perhaps a large feather, and those gay colors โ those cloaks โ more like a gentlemanโs overcoat than anything else, this style indicates a northerner โ secesh ladies are nowhere, and donโt appear so often โ the โyanks"" monopolize the streets, military matter are โin status quo"" โ an expedition has gone across the Lake and are occupying Madisonville โ some of the companies of the 12th Me have gone โ not Co. โC."" but- I must write to mother and Frank. </p>
<p>
Your brother</p>

Charles</p>

<p>
In letters written in March 1864, Boothby notes with pride his companyโs involvement in the festivities associated with Governor Michael Hahnโs inauguration:</p>
<p>
<blcockquote>I had my company there, as part of the guard, and in performing the โAnvil Chorus"" by the band. Forty of them beat time on anvils. I drilled them the night before and in the morning. The next day I was about tired out. The beat of a brass drum was represented by cannon, fired by electricity. It was a tremendous concert and a perfect successโฆ</p>
<p>
I took my company out to aid in inaugurating Gov. Hahn. It was fitting that the 1st New Orleans Vols. Should help inaugurate the first Governor after the stateโs redemption from rebeldom. </blockquote></p>
<p>

The larger significance of the regimentโs participation in the celebration is illustrated by G. Howard Hunterโs observation that immigrant enlistment was part of a larger picture that developed in New Orleans in the midst of war and occupation:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>New Orleans Unionist regiments were part of an immigrant movement that changed the power structure of the cityโa movement which reached its apogee in 1864, when, in what would have been unthinkable before the war, foreign-born and native-born laborers together elected German immigrant Michael Hahn as governor of occupied Louisiana (Hunter 186).</blockquote></p>
<p>
Apart from the excitement of the inauguration, Richard N. Current points out in <i>Lincolnโs Loyalists</i>:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Many of the loyalist troops spent most if not all of their time doing such quotidian duties as garrisoning, guarding, patrolling, foraging, recruiting, scouting and raiding rather than engaging the enemy head-on in large-scale, spectacular battles (Current 159).</blockquote></p>
<p> 
In a letter to his mother dated July 24, 1864, Boothby notes concern about his menโs behavior, no doubt influenced by boredom associated with their limited duties:  โThe regiment has been paid today- and a strict guard must be kept, to prevent the men getting out and going on a โspree.โ""</p>
<p>
The 1st New Orleans Volunteers remained on duty through May 1866. By this time, the unpleasant task of serving as a firing squad had been added to their list of duties.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>May 25, 1866</p>
<p>
Dear brother-</p>
<p>
We have in a military way all we can do with officers and men furnish all the details that go from the city- all the patrols in the city and hang or shoot any โniggersโ when called upon, yesterday a โFreedmanโs Bureauโ or in other words a colored soldier was shot at the Police Jail - by sentence of genโl court martial- he had killed a white man.</p>
<p>
Ludike and myself with our companies were detailed for the guard and also furnished the shooting party. The soldier was of the 10th Heavy Artillery he was led into the jail year behind his coffin, the drums beating the dead march- his hands were tied behind him, and he was set upon his coffin.  Twelve men under Lieutenant Powell were the shooting party- six of the men with loaded muskets. I noticed after they had fired that six bullets had passed entirely though him near the heart of course he died instantly. About two weeks since, a colored soldier was hung at the same place, for the same crime.</p> 
<p>
Ludike and myself with our companies were the guard - the scene was repugnant; at the first fall of the rope, the man was only stunned, the rope having slipped. He was again taken upon the scaffold the rope was again cut, and this time his neck was broken. Do not think the chief duties of the 1st New Orleans is executing negroes.</blockquote></p>
<p>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>
Boothby remained in New Orleans after he was mustered out of service. He married a local woman, Celia OโNeal (of whom he writes frequently in war-time correspondence with family members), had seven children, and held a variety of positions in the city, including the office of Superintendent of Public Education. It was during his tenure in the final years of Reconstruction that there were several major violent episodes in response to efforts to integrate New Orleans schools โ Boothby sought to maintain the status quo, urging black leaders to stop short of forcing black enrollment in white schools (Current  169).  In 1900 Boothby attended the Republican National Convention as a representative of the 1st District of New Orleans. He later served as Superintendent of the U. S. Mint.</p>  
<p>
The Charles W. Boothby Papers include Boothbyโs descriptions of New Orleans during war, and official documents of his regiment, providing a unique record of the 1st New Orleans Volunteers. He fleshes out the Reconstruction and Redemption eras in the city as well, detailing cultural events (Mardi Gras) as well as violent political upheavals (Battle of Liberty Place). Both a witness to and agent of Crescent City history, Boothby died there in 1908.</p>

Elder diary, Mss. 4353, Louisiana and Lower Mississippi Valley Collections, LSU Libraries, Baton Rouge, La. Size: 1 item.<h3>New Acquisitions in the </h3><h3>Louisiana and Lower Mississippi Valley Collections</h3><h3>LSU Libraries' Special Collections</h3><br><p>As in many diaries of the day, the early pages of John Carroll Elder's journal are filled with reports on the weather, crop planting, and day to day activities such as attending church. In spite of the start of hostilities between North and South one year before, his life was apparently affected little by fighting in the East. Though Elder's entries are short on details, they successfully convey a Confederate planter's experience in war.</p><p><blockquote>February 23</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>To church at 7 o'clock. Godfather for Caroline.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>February 24</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>6 Ploughing and [illegible]. Ned grinding corn.  Austin and women breaking corn. Dry wind from North.</blockquote></p><p>But when the Crescent City fell to Union hands in April 1862, everything changed.</p><p>Forty nine year-old John Carroll Elder, a native of Maryland, was a planter in East Baton Rouge Parish at the outbreak of the Civil War. At the time of the 1860 census, Elder's real estate value is listed as $30,000; personal property totaled $20,500. Sixteen slaves, ages one to 50, lived and worked on his plantation. Based on Elder's references, it is likely that cotton was the principal crop.  His property was located along the Mississippi River, a few miles north of downtown Baton Rouge near the modern community of Scotlandville (site of historically black institution, Southern University). He was probably Catholic, as his wife, Mary Elizabeth Duffel, is buried in the Catholic Cemetery associated with St. Joseph's Church (later a cathedral) in Baton Rouge, and the Catholic Church is the only one specifically mentioned in his diary.</p> <p>Elder records Union activity along the river and in the capital city from the first days of occupation. The April 25 entryรนthe day before the Union capture of New Orleansรนrefers to his efforts to hide cotton from the enemy (no doubt in response to Governor Thomas Overton Moore's order for citizens to destroy the crop to keep it from falling into enemy hands). In May, Elder witnesses the arrival of Union troops in a variety of naval vessels, including the gunboats. Intertwined with his reports of ships and Federal soldiers, Elder notes that plowing, planting, and the children's blackberry picking continues.</p><p><blockquote>May 4</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>I burn cotton in gin. Gunboats coming up...</blockquote></p><p>General Benjamin Butler's Order No. 29 banning the use of Confederate paper currency is mentioned, followed by a description of the bombardment of Baton Rouge:</p><p><blockquote>May 28</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>Capt. Farragut Bombarded Baton Rouge.{1} Women and children running, the road crowded with them...burning shells struck the Catholic church and other building with grapeshot.</blockquote></p><p>Elder describes his many encounters with the enemy, who search his property, attempt to force him to take the oath of allegiance to the United States, steal crops and livestock from him, and harass his neighbors. Area residents did their best to hide valuable crops and livestock from the enemy. The presence of Federal soldiers in the area brought the war home to the Elder family: </p><p><blockquote>June 3</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>Gun boat stopped before the house and 1000 men with 6 pieces [of] artillery came on the plantation to see if there were any guerillas...Col. Payne commanding. </blockquote></p><p><blockquote>June 4</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>Meet men up the road and concluded we could do nothing with pop guns against cannon and Enfield rifles. Heard we whipped the enemy at Richmond. Killed 2 rabbits.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>June 5</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>Met 10 Guerillas back of field. Visited Mr. Blunt with Elizabeth. Negroes scraping sweet potatoes, planting corn.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>June 6</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>Six thousand soldiers in Baton Rouge. One ship, 4 gunboats sail full of runaway negroes. [Soldiers] rob Birds Plantation of corn, meat milk poultry.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>June 8 (S)</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>Did not go to church because the enemy were in Baton Rouge.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>June 15 (S)</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>Stayed at home, the enemy in Baton Rouge. Ten mortar and gunboats...to Vicksburg. Enemy took Ludlow's horses.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>June 17</blockquote><p><blockquote>Gunboat and 2 mortar boats. A. Williams{2} negroes say that he and son were shot and buried in the levee.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>June 18</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>Plowing corn and cane hoeing pota[toe]s. Six enemy came to Williams Plantation, order[ed] the negroes to go to work.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>June 20</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>...All boats left for Vicksburg.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>June 21</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>...Enemy put handcuffs on Mr. Gee, broke his trunk open and gave his clothes to the negroes of A.A. Williams.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>June 22 (S) </blockquote></p><p><blockquote>Enemy took Bogel's Cotton. Fed their horses and men, about 35 of them asked me to take the oath of allegiance. I refused. Enemy arrived at 11 o'clock at night. At sunrise came to my house, the servants [were] all crying with fear. Kept Latile in room till evening.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>June 26</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>Enemy taking Mr. Bogel's cotton on the ferry boat... left 15 bales at landing.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>June 28 </blockquote></p><p><blockquote>Gravellin had wagon loaded with Bogel's Cotton. Had it put back to bayou.</blockquote></p><p>In an attempt to retake Louisiana for the Confederacy, General Earl Van Dorn sent troops to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to engage the enemy. Opposing forces met in the capital city on August 5. Elder outlines measures taken by his family to leave their home after receiving word that Van Dorn had ordered an evacuation of the area in anticipation of fighting.</p><p><blockquote>July 1</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>Gen.Van Dorn's proclamation ordering every one to move 8 miles east of river. My family [is] busy packing up trunk and boxes.</blockquote></p><p>In general as the Union army advanced, slaves took notice, and work levels dropped significantly. Historians note many instances in which slaves who stayed behind on the plantation assisted arriving Union soldiers in locating the hidden valuables of slaveholders. Many left the relative safety of the plantation seeking uncertain freedom for themselves and their families among the soldiers in blue. Elder reports the waves of departure as slaves from neighboring areas begin to leave:</p><p><blockquote>July 10</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>Ned left last night with Taylor's negro Mose in a skiff. Drove 21 head of cows and calves over to Devil Swamp. Taylor's negro child died. Baptized two negro children of Taylor's. Five negroes left of Judge Favrot's. Heard Blanchard was taken prisoner.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>July 11</blockquote><p><blockquote>Flat boat of negroes left LeBlanc. Twenty five of A.A. Williams's negroes left.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>July 14</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>To Baton Rouge with Mrs. Taylor to look for negroes.  At bank received note 80 รป Gov. Shepland{3} told him of Russell and [that] armed men came and took my cotton by force. He had the commander Gen. McMillan to give me an order for any cotton which I stored in Capt. Payne's warehouse. Governor said to the officers --do you supply citizens with armed men to steal? Got a pass for one week</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>July 16</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>Remained all night in Baton Rouge at the priest's house. Engage the police officers to look for Ned, Sam and Mose.</blockquote></p><p>Throughout the occupation Elder and his neighbors are plagued by the federal requisitioning of their property. In this instance, Elder makes note of the commanding officer and the regiment involved:</p><p><blockquote>July 28</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>Got home at 12 o'clock. Lt. Grimstead of 21st Indiana regiment4 came with a company of armed men and took on boat 11 head [of] cattle, 1 sheep, chickens and 30 watermelons.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>August 5</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>Battle [of] Baton Rouge.</blockquote></p><p>Once Federal troops focused their attention on Vicksburg, the citizens of Baton Rouge were able to function somewhat normally, as Elder indicates in subsequent entries:</p><p><blockquote>Undated</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>The enemy left Baton Rouge about the middle August. They took 13 bales of my cotton to New Orleans.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>October 16</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>Received payment of 13 bales of cotton in New Orleans.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>October 21</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>Negroes gathering corn.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>October 22</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>To Baton Rouge with Taylor. [Had] my hair cut. Brother Tom [is] very sick.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>October 24 </blockquote></p><p><blockquote>To Devil's Swamp with [illegible]; seen 1 sow and pig, 1 cow and calf.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>October 25</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>Turned very cold and windy.</blockquote></p><p>Elder closes his diary with A list of articles taken or destroyed on John C. Elder Plantation from 13 to 20th March 1863 By the Federal soldiers of the United States Army. Among the items listed: 14 mules, 2 horses, 1 mare, 10 cows, 10 calves, 4 oxen, 3 sows, 20 pigs, 19 turkeys, 70 chickens, plates, saucers, cooking utensils, harnesses, saddles, a grindstone, animal fodder hatchets, and one silver thimble. He notes that the soldiers also broke the stove, damaged the cabin door and destroyed the corn house. He estimated the property's total worth at $5,472. Union confiscation and/or destruction of the property belonging to Confederate civilians was commonplace; it is likely that Elder's neighbors suffered similar damage. </p><p>The details of Elder's life after the war are unknown, save the fact that his wife died in 1867. John Carroll Elder died in Baton Rouge on August 7, 1900. Though it offers no specific details of his life, the obituary in the <i>Daily Advocate</i> describes Elder as one of the oldest and most respected citizens of this parish and a member of one of the most historical families in the country.  While there is little supplemental documentation of his life in the historical record, his diary stands as a testament to one man's trials on the Confederate homefront.</p><p>Note: Grammar, spelling, and punctuation of the original diary text has been standardized for this article.</p>--------------------<p>1.

1896	788415514		Soldier Boy: Letters and History of an Illinois Union Soldier		More, Betty E.			"Colonel Smith D. Atkins loathed General Gordon Granger and sought to persuade William Rosecrans to attach Atkins's 92nd Illinois Infantry to active duty at the front. Relief came after Colonel John Wilder observed the regiment building a bridge across the Duck River, liked what he saw, and had it assigned to his brigade of mounted in-fantry. The ""Ninety-twosters"" were overjoyed, none more so than Eugene McBride Swaggart. <p> Eleven months earlier, in August 1862, Eugene enlisted in the 92nd Illinois at Camp Fuller, in Rockford. Letters written from the field to his wife, Elvira, are the essence of <b>Soldier Boy</b>. The regiment joined the Army of Kentucky under Granger, and Eugene's correspondence expressed concern for his wife and much description of ""solger"" life. <p> Eugene and his comrades became known as the ""Abolition Regiment"" because the officers took in several contraband slaves as personal servants. Superiors ordered Atkins to return the fugitives, but he refused. Indictment for ""stealing chattel"" was his reward. Difficult marches and failed attempts to capture John Hunt Morgan were also part of the early history of the regiment. <p> February 1863 found the men near Nashville, Tennessee, where they helped to drive Earl Van Dorn south of Columbia. In June, Eugene became ill and was in the hospital until the end of July. Unable to be with the regiment when it joined Wilder's brigade, he soon caught up. During the battle of Chickamauga, Eugene was on detached service to Lilly's battery and found himself responsible for carrying ""ammunition to the gun."" The regiment was in all the movements of Hugh Judson Kilpatrick's cavalry during the Atlanta campaign, covering the left of Sherman's army as it withdrew from Jonesboro. It participated in the cavalry fighting while marching through the Carolinas. <p> In his letters, Eugene's concern is mostly for things back home. When writing of campaigns and battles, he is often disappointingly brief. A scattering of letters from Eugene's family and friends are also included, adding to the personal view of the War. Betty E. More,  the editor of <b>Soldier Boy</b> and great-granddaughter of Eugene and Elvira, bolsters Eugene's letters with details about the regiment. This helps greatly, but the editor acknowledges she is not an historian. The supporting information is from only a handful of sources, particularly <i>The Civil War Almanac</i> (1983) and the <i>Supplement to the Official Records</i> (Broadfoot, ISBN 1568372752, $5000.00 set). <p> Some errors exist; for example, Thomas Crittenden commanded the XXI Corps, not the XX Corps, and William S. Rosecrans's middle name is ""Starke,"" not ""Starkie."" The two indices and glossary are quite helpful, but unfortunately there are no maps. Even with these shortcomings, Betty E. More has done a yeoman's job with <b>Soldier Boy</b>. This book, though primarily a family history, would be enjoyable reading for anyone with a special interest in the 92nd Illinois Infantry.  <p> <i>Larry G. Ligget is the co-author, with the late Frank J. Welcher, of</i> Coburn's Brigade: 85th Indiana, 33rd Indiana, 19th Michigan, and 22nd Wisconsin in the Western Civil War <i>(1999).

2164	1570033633	$39.95	The Jewish Confederates		Rosen, Robert N.			"Conjure up an image of Johnny Reb marching into battle and it is unlikely that the picture of a Jewish soldier will emerge. Indeed, raise the subject of Jews in the Confederacy at all and the conversation will begin, and most likely end, with Judah P. Benjamin. And yet, in this very important new book, Robert N. Rosen, author of two previous histories of Charleston, South Carolina, reminds us that religion and ethnicity are the twin towers of neglect in the study of the Civil War. <p> The publication of <b>The Jewish Confederates</b> is particularly timely. Since the naming of Joseph Lieberman as the Democratic vice presidential nominee, the topic of Jews within the fabric of American history has received renewed attention. In an earlier generation, Rabbi Bertram W. Korn and Jacob Radar Marcus pioneered the study of southern and Civil War Jewish history, yet few scholars, with the exception of those who wrote localized studies, followed Korn's and Marcus's impressive example on any grand scale. All scholars of the Civil War era thus will be beholden to Rosen for this reminder that new inquiry still can be pursued successfully in this subject.  <p> During the Civil War, southern Jewish families not only supported the Confederacy, but they did so, in some cases, with a depth of commitment that would be the envy of Ashley Wilkes! Most had arrived in America only in the 1840s and 1850s. Yet in their new homeland, Jews were able to reconcile their yearly Passover celebration of the Exodus from Egypt with their support for the Confederate States of America and its institution of slavery. Struck by the freedom they now enjoyed in their new country, the recent immigrants from Bavaria, Prussia, and Central Europe repaid that gift with patriotic fervor and a dedication to the cause second to none. <p> Interestingly enough, while there was anti-Semitism in the Old South, there was remarkably little in the armies of Robert E. Lee and Joseph Johnston, or in the executive offices of Jefferson Davis. The same, of course, cannot be said about the Union army, where both Ulysses S. Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman issued flagrantly anti-Jewish orders and proclamations. ""Although there were anti-Jewish outbursts in the South during the war,"" writes Rosen, ""the Confederate South was, contrary, to popular belief, the exact opposite of the image of the Old South held by most contemporary Americans."" <p> Few Jewish Confederate soldiers owned slaves, so for them the War was not necessarily about slavery. Indeed, most were poor clerks, peddlers, artisans, tailors, shopkeepers, and petty merchants who not only did not own slaves, but held little hope that they ever would. Coming from the German states, some Jewish soldiers even privately condemned the peculiar institution, but openly they acknowledged little disagreement with prevailing views on race and slavery. <p> Why, then, did they fight? The primary reason seems to be a sense of duty. ""It was the cardinal belief of anti-Semites and others in the nineteenth century,"" writes Rosen, ""that 'the Wandering Jew' was citizen of no country, that they were cowards and they were disloyal."" Thus, the author adds, ""many a Jewish soldier enlisted to prove he was a man and a worthy citizen."" Moreover, active involvement in the Confederacy, Jews believed, would facilitate their deep desire to be assimilated into southern society. <p> Profiling both the prominent and the humble who volunteered for the Confederacy, Rosen relates the experiences of officers, enlisted men, businessmen, politicians, nurses, rabbis, and doctors. Judah Benjamin is included, of course, but so are less familiar names such as Colonel Abraham C. Myers, quartermaster general of the Confederacy; Major Adolph Proskauer of the 125th Alabama; Major Alexander Hart of the 5th Louisiana; and Phoebe Levy Pember, the matron of Richmond's Chimborazo Hospital. There is mention also of Benjamin Franklin Jonas of Fenner's Battery, who after the War was sent to the U.S. Senate by Louisiana to lead its fight against Reconstruction and, in so doing, became the first practicing Jew to sit in the Senate. There are many other Jewish Johnny Rebs included who fought in infantry, cavalry, and artillery units in every major campaign. <p> A review of this length cannot adequately convey Rosen's hard work in examining the Jewish communities of the Confederate South. Most readers would assume that the focal points for a study such as this would be Charleston, Savannah, and Richmond. Although there were indeed many Jewish soldiers from South Carolina, Georgia, and Virginia, the typical ""Hebrew"" or ""Isrlite"" soldiers, as they called themselves, actually were German-speaking immigrants from Louisiana, a state that was home to approximately one-third of all Jews in the South in 1861. <p> Even for those confident that they already understand the War, this is a work that will dispel common misconceptions about the Confederacy, its leadership and soldiers, and its Jewish population. Generously illustrated, <b>The Jewish Confederates</b> will be used and discussed for a long time to come - and no book can, or should, aspire to any higher accolade. <p> <i>Jason H.

1925	1572492147		United States Marine Corps in the Civil War: The Final Year		Sullivan, David M.			David M. Sullivan's lavishly illustrated series, <i>The United States Marine Corps in the Civil War</i>, is the first extensive history of the Corps during the 1860s. The author's main purpose is to show that, contrary to popular perceptions, marines fought in almost every area of operation and conducted themselves with honor and professionalism. <p> Sullivan's initial book, <i>The First Year</i>, begins with the raid against John Brown at Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. Although Col. Robert E. Lee, USA, commanded the action, Marine Lieutenant Isr'l Green's troops engaged Brown's force. The book, after discussing the problems the Corps faced in preparing for the war, then details the Corps's role in the battles of Bull Run, Fort Sumter, Hampton Roads, and Tulifnney Crossroads. <p> <i>The Second Year</i> delves into other areas, including how marines helped the navy with its blockading operations at sea and on the Mississippi River. It also covers small unit actions, the expansion of the Corps, and the life of enlisted marines. The book's final chapter provides a brief history of the Marine Corps Band and its wartime duties. <p> Among the events of 1863 chronicled in the third installment are the failed attempt to retake Fort Sumter, the botched foray down Louisiana's Red River, and the marines' role in the capture of the C.S.S. <i>Alabama</i> and <i>Florida</i>. In addition,<i>The Third Year</i> discusses how marines played an instrumental role in putting down the 1863 New York draft riot. Sullivan also tries to make sense of the recruiting debacle caused by Commandant Col. John Harris when he wrongly promised prospective marines a bounty available only to men entering the volunteer army. <p> In <b>The Final Year</b>, Sullivan's fourth volume, the Corps fights its largest battles. The Battle of Mobile Bay saw marines participate in David Farragut's capture of the last major Confederate port on the Gulf of Mexico. The leathernecks performed their standard naval battle duties: sniping and manning several of the warships' heavy cannons. The only time that marines touched land was to garrison Fort Powell. Because of poor recruiting efforts and Congress's allowance of only 3,000 marines, the Corps never had sufficient troops to take part in most of the war's largest combined operations. <p> The Second Battle of Fort Fisher featured the largest number of marines to fight on land during the war. Roughly 400 marines joined 1,600 seamen in the assault on the South's most powerful defensive position. Admiral David Porter and the Naval Brigade's commander, Randolph Kidder Breese, botched the land action and blamed the marines for the attack's failure. Sullivan provides a cogent defense that explodes Porter and Breese's assertions that the marines shirked their duty. In fact, the author shows that the troops fought to the best of their ability. <p> During most of the war the Corps was short of men, and John Harris's tenure did little to increase the size or enhance the prestige of his service. <b>The Final Year</b> records Jacob Zeilen's subsequent rise to the position of Commandant, but Sullivan, somewhat unjustly, claims that Zeilen was as ineffective as his predecessor. In June 1864, Zeilen received command of the anemic force-short of men and lacking its former reputation-and could do little to correct the problems. Although Zeilen failed to take dramatic steps to rebuild the Corps, Sullivan does not acknowledge that he did start the process that led to a more respected and effective fighting force. <p> The book concludes with the marines' role in the search for John Wilkes Booth-a fitting end for a history of the Civil War Corps. David Sullivan spent 25 years researching this untapped topic, and the fruits of his labor, though occasionally flawed, demonstrate the Corps's unheralded contributions-from the raid at Harpers Ferry to the military response after President Abraham Lincoln's assassination-to this dark chapter in American history. <p> <i>E. Rory O'Connor holds a master's in history from Louisiana State University. His thesis is on the command, recruiting, and manpower problems faced by the Marine Corps in the Civil War.</i>	O'Connor, E.

Two topics deserve particular mention: the challenges of keeping ships adequately manned with trained and experienced sailors and the logistical system necessary to run the seagoing war machine.<p>The Union navy suffered from severe fluctuations in manpower at the outset of the War, but sound policy decisions and the foresight of leaders such as Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles produced a more stable influx of seamen. As it grew in terms of manpower, the navy underwent an uncomfortable transformation in warships, one that required a new breed of sailor. It is this movement from sail to steam that Ringle captures best.<p>Drawing on his own experience as an engineering officer, the author identifies the need for technical professionals trained to run the increasingly complex engineering plants of Union ships, such as John Ericsson's <i>Monitor</i>, as the impetus for the creation of the engineering ratings. The engineers, although not initially welcomed alongside the tradition-bound deck ratings, quickly proved indispensable.<p>The logistical hurdles to supplying ""Mr. Lincoln's Navy"" with the requisite food, coal, and ammunition were enormous, particularly given the tasks the navy was charged with: enforcing a sustained and unprecedented blockade, supporting the Union army, and hunting Confederate vessels. Ringle explains in convincing detail how the navy developed the means of procuring and distributing matriel to an armada stretched along the coast of North America. <p>The navy was not alone in its resupply efforts. Ever eager to make a buck, sutler ships commanded by enterprising merchant captains helped fill matriel requirements that navy supply ships alone could not. This logistical success also helps explain why the Union sailor was better clothed, better trained, better fed, and more likely to survive combat injuries than either his army counterpart or his Confederate enemy.<p><i>Timothy J.

Described by author Joseph Durkin as a man of heart, Stephen Mallory harbored a deep passion for his family, friends, and education.  In fact, Mallory's intellectual curiosity allowed him to move quickly through the ranks of the civil service to become Secretary of the Navy for the newly-formed Confederate States of American in February 1861.  He quickly recognized the Union's naval superiority and implemented a plan to cripple the North's vulnerable merchant marine.  Mallory sought to ensure the success of this strategy with the creation of the first ironclad vessel, the <i>Virginia</i>.  While the approach ultimately failed to secure victory for the South, Mallory's four years as Confederate Naval Chief did much to revolution naval science.

1824	803247915		A Higher Duty: Desertion Among Georgia Troops During the Civil War		Weitz, Mark A.			"Desertion is one of the least understood topics in Civil War studies, though an adequate account of it has implications for several areas of historical research, including life on the home front, morale, and nationalism. The current volume is an important first step in addressing the evolution of desertion and its effects on Georgia and the Confederacy as a whole.<p>In <b>A Higher Duty</b>, Mark A. Weitz explores three questions: who deserted? why? and when? The answers are addressed largely by analyzing the relation between the location of the deserter's home and the location of the Union army. <p>In addressing the first question, Weitz maintains that there was a ""clear correlation between desertion and county location."" Georgia can be divided into three distinct geographical regions: the plantation belt, the Upcountry and upper Piedmont, and the Wiregrass and Pine Barrens. Though the socio-economic and cultural differences between these areas were not strong enough to keep Georgia out of the Confederacy, these differences help explain why, as the War dragged on, the majority of Georgia's deserters were from the Upcountry. Few Upcountry residents owned slaves and, because of the mountainous conditions, many found it difficult to identify with issues beyond their immediate community. <p><b>A Higher Duty</b> pursues the second and third questions by carefully examining letters from the home front and the location of Sherman's Union army. The advance of Sherman's army through northern Georgia -- before and during his advance on Atlanta -- made it feasible for soldiers to answer the calls of their loved ones. The majority of Georgians who deserted did so between late 1863 and the end of 1864. In considering the more analytical aspects, Weitz provides a clear picture of the motives, emotions, and beliefs of these Confederate soldiers.<p>Weitz rarely moves to larger historiographical questions. He briefly addresses the debate surrounding the proper causal analysis of the Confederate surrender. Did the Confederacy crumble as a result of internal pressures and lack of will, or did it succumb, as James McPherson and Gary Gallagher maintain, to an external pressure of defeat on the battlefield that brought about a reduction in devotion to the cause? Weitz without hesitation embraces the interpretation that internal economic and social conditions, rather than poor battlefield performance of Confederate armies, caused a sharp decrease in devotion. Though this conclusion is borne out by data on northern counties, the author does not explain how his position handles the low numbers of deserters in the plantation belt who were more strongly committed to the Confederate cause.   <p><b>A Higher Duty</b> has given us the first detailed account of desertion in one Confederate state. More general conclusions about desertion in the Confederacy as a whole will come after similar studies of other states.<p><i>Kevin Levin teaches philosophy and intellectual history at the Alabama School of Mathematics and Science in Mobile.

2198	1570721580		Sisters of Providence		Speer, Allen Paul			"Despite the flurry of Civil War diaries, memoirs, and family histories, the average 19th century American woman is often overlooked in the general conversation among historians. In <b>Sisters of Providence</b>, editors Allen Paul and Janet Barton Speer detail the story of two sisters, Nancy Jane (Jennie) and Anne Melissa (Ann) Speer. The editors invite us to take a close look at two articulate daughters of a North Carolina yeoman farmer. The young women did not suffer the pain and the heartbreak that is associated with the Civil War ""but rather suffered a thoroughly debilitating crisis of the spirit."" <p> The editors evenly divide the book into four chapters. In Chapter 1, ""Jennie"" tracks her Christian conversion and Christ's influence in her life. She struggles with issues of holiness, identifying God's purpose for her life, and her commitment to do right in a wicked world. While Jennie constantly reflects on her own salvation and her relationship with Christ, she, like so many 19th century mainstream Methodists, experienced anxiety over her own place in eternity. Jennie grasps the liberating assurance that she was put on earth and saved by divine mandate, leaving her with the conviction that she must fulfill God's will for her life or possibly suffer eternal damnation. <p> In Chapters 2 and 3, the editors delineate the personalities of the two young women, detailing the complex interplay of God, philosophy, theology, faith, education, family, and nature. The details reveal the gripping thoughts and complexities of life in 19th-century America. In the Speers' telling, the sisters emerge as women of talent who spent much of their formative teenage years writing and reflecting. <p> As opposed to the broad considerations of the earlier chapters, the final chapter entitled ""Providence"" focuses on the sisters' last years. The prevailing theme is despair, induced by their 25-year-old brother Aaron's death, Jennie's bereavement and failing health, and Ann's attempts at consoling her older sibling. <p> The abundant writings from the women's personal diaries, as well as the editorial comments, are both a strength and a weakness of the book. Certainly specialists on antebellum America or on 19th century American women will appreciate gaining access to these seldom-heard voices. Yet the average reader might opt out for a smooth narrative rather than reading through these entries. Moreover, this reviewer found Jennie's Christian walk fraught with difficulties that are removed from those experienced by many evangelicals today. <p>     This is an informative book, sober and quite grim, in which the arrangement of material is logical and sequential. The diary passages share the concerns of two backcountry sisters and the editors provide some additional social history, even if <b>Sisters of Providence</b> contributes little commentary in regard to the dynamic movements of the 19th century. <p> <i>Jeffery B.

With the approach of General William T. Sherman's forces, mill owners fled, leaving behind ""mill bosses"" to operate the mills with only a home guard for defense, thus setting the stage for the tragedy that followed.<p>As Sherman's army ravaged the Georgia countryside, millworkers -- mostly women and children -- continued to work. After Union soldiers marched swiftly into the area and arrested the workers, Sherman ordered their deportation because their labor would benefit the Confederacy if they remained. Workers were told to pack what they could carry and vacate their homes.<p>The book follows the plight of two millworker families -- Walter and Lizzie Russell Stewart and their four children in Sweetwater and four of the Kendley siblings in nearby Roswell. Walter Stewart joined the Confederate Army in 1863, was captured at Vicksburg, and was paroled two days later. On furlough, he promised Lizzie he would return if ""the Yankees get to Atlanta."" He narrowly missed them but was reunited with his family in Louisville. The Kendley siblings watched as the Union army commandeered the town, burned the mills, and overran their apartment building.<p>Over 400 people, mostly women and children, were shipped to a women's prison in Louisville. Cook gives a stark picture of the pitiful conditions that the families endured. Local women helped to relieve the squalor through donations, but overall the workers suffered greatly. Though some women found work, many continued their sorrowful journey by taking advantage of the Union's offer of further deportation to Indiana.<p>Cook demonstrates how a local incident can offer a chilling face to human cruelty. Utilizing a masterful blend of solid fact and reasonable supposition to weave a credible story that gives the reader a vivid picture of the millworkers' ordeal, the author portrays ordinary citizens who handled the sorrows of war. <p>Well-written and meticulously researched, this is a book for people who enjoy stepping off the beaten path of Civil War history and discovering the more unusual happenings of that era.<p><i>Sue DeVille, a published author and student of Civil War history, serves as director of the Opelousas Museum & Interpretive Center in Opelousas, Louisiana.</i>"	DeVille, Sue	Fall 1999	1999-09-01	Review	Sherman's forced deportation of Georgia civilians	Sorrowful journey	Crane Hill Publishers	0000-00-00				"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=279 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/NorthAcrossTears.jpg"">"

2149	1577470494		A Vast Army of Women: Maine's Uncounted Forces in the American Civil War		Sudlow, Lynda L.			Driving north from Boston on the way to Southwest Harbor, Maine, I always slow for an intersection outside Ellsworth, familiar now through many summers, where Route 1 joins the road from Blue Hill to form a tree-shaded oasis, remote from the stream of eastbound traffic. Guarding this little park stands the statue of a Union infantryman who gazes steadily ahead, rifle at his side, pack on his back, seeing inwardly, perhaps, the ravaged meadows of Antietam or bloodied thickets of the Wilderness. Memorialized in stark, indigenous rock, he is a Son of Maine, come home from the War. <p> Far less publicly celebrated than this northern soldier have been his female counterparts: women of Maine who served the Union as best they might, with grit and ingenuity, just behind, or often beside, their husbands and brothers at the front. It is this previously unsung company of women that Lynda L. Sudlow has chosen as the focus of her enlightening new history. <b>A Vast Army of Women</b> reminds us that assertive, innovative service was not solely the province of men between 1861 and 1865, and furthermore that the fortunes of the North were significantly enhanced by the energy and perseverance of women.  <p> The result of Sudlow's labor is an inspiring chronicle of nurses, foot soldiers, doctors, relief workers, and home front organizers distinguished for their ability. Sudlow rescues these women from obscurity, skillfully reconstructing their stories to form a narrative based on their own writings and the testimonials of others. She also examines the critical roles played by the United States Sanitary Commission, the Maine Camp Hospital Association, and other volunteer organizations staffed largely by women and traditionally overlooked in Civil War histories. <p> Individual women of Maine are singled out, and their experiences detailed with thoroughness and respect: visionary Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell, enterprising nurse and teacher Amy Morris Bradley, and the indomitable Sarah Sampson. Perhaps most memorable of all is writer Elizabeth Akers, who managed to combine the rigors of Washington journalism with army nursing - and at the same time produced poetry of lyrical, Whitmanesque beauty evoking pride and an unbearable sense of loss. <p> Sudlow's research and documentation are impeccable, and her presentation clear and scholarly, if occasionally monotonous in its repetition of parallel experiences shared by large numbers of women. Yet these repeated memories become doubly significant because of their pervasiveness, dramatizing yet again how neglected such sources have been in the collective canon of this saddest of conflicts. Sudlow contributes to the growing body of American women's history with discipline and professionalism. <b>A Vast Army of Women</b> is both a valuable addition to the literature and an engrossing read. <p> <i>Nancy Scripture Garrison is a guest lecturer in Women's Studies at Curry College and a contributor to</i> North & South <i>magazine.

1947	087338623X		We Have It Damn Hard Out Here: The Civil War Letters of Sergeant Thomas W. Smith, 6th Pennsylvania Cavalry		Wittenberg, Eric J.			"During a cavalry action near Culpeper, Virginia, on August 1, 1863, Sergeant Thomas Smith of the 6th Pennsylvania Cavalry heard Brig. Gen. John Buford angrily reprimand Maj. Henry Hazeltine, the 6th's commander, for failing to properly lead his troopers in a charge on a Confederate battery. According to Smith, Buford screamed: ""Men I know it tis not your Fault, but [turning to Hazeltine] Its your fault you cowardly Son of a Bitch you consider yourself under arrest."" It is this sort of personal glimpse into the Army of Potomac's cavalry corps that makes <b>We Have It Damn Hard Out Here</b> so interesting.<p>Thomas W. Smith was 23 years old when he joined the Union army in October 1861 for three years' service. A Philadelphia upholsterer, he still resided with his parents and siblings at the time of his enlistment, and his wartime letters to them served as the basis of the book. Tom Smith's unit was unique in the Federal service in that it was the only cavalry regiment armed with lances. <p>Organized by 1846 West Point graduate Col. Richard H. Rush, the regiment carried the official designation of the 6th Pennsylvania Cavalry Regiment but unofficially became known as ""Rush's Lancers."" It served in all of the major campaigns of the Army of the Potomac from the Peninsula through the summer of 1864, when it was transferred to the Army of the Shenandoah. Company I, to which Smith was assigned, served as a line unit and also saw detached service as one of the Army of the Potomac's headquarters guards. <p>As a result of his company's different missions and assignments, Smith's experiences ranged from mounted charges to scouting duty to providing security for the Army of the Potomac's commanding general.<p>Smith's letters are filled with descriptions of the monotony of camp life, the misery of the hospital, and the difficulties of hard campaigning. His spelling, grammar, punctuation, and use of the upper/lower case is irregular, but these problems do not detract from our understanding of Smith's intent. <p>Editor Eric J. Wittenberg wisely chose not to overhaul the letters so they would maintain their ""essence and integrity."" The editor did add periods and removed commas to give the letters greater clarity, but unfortunately he did not indicate just when and where he made these editorial changes. Wittenberg also provides narrative to introduce and connect the letters, which is useful in providing the necessary historical context. At times his commentary is redundant and his own prose is occasionally awkward, but not to the point where it is distracting. Overall, he did a fine job of researching the various people mentioned by Smith and gives us a fuller picture of Smith and his family through the use of census data, military service records, and pension files.<p>Sergeant Smith did not re-enlist at the end of his three-year term and was discharged in October 1864. He returned to Philadelphia and his antebellum occupation, but military service had worn him down, and rheumatism curtailed his ability to work with his hands. He married when he was 40 years old, and by the time he applied for a pension in 1891 he had become so incapacitated that his wife was the sole source of the family income. Smith also was an alcoholic, which eventually caused his death in 1896 at the age of 58. <p>Thanks to Wittenberg, Smith's wartime experiences live on in his letters, giving us yet another remarkable example of the life of the common soldier of the Union.<p><i>Mark A.

2078	810934302		Maps and Mapmakers of the Civil War	Maps and Mapmakers of the Civil War	McElfresh, Earl B.			During the Civil War, a map of good quality had the potential to make the difference between victory and defeat on the battlefield. Earl B. McElfresh's <b>Maps and Mapmakers of the Civil War</b> brings together the War's most notable, interesting, and beautiful maps, some of which have never before been reproduced in their original cartographic format. In addition, McElfresh not only describes how the maps of the time were created and used in the Civil War, but also gives brief descriptions of the men who created them.<p>At the outbreak of the Civil War much of the United States was uncharted terrain. Yet by 1865, the majority of the land over which the armies campaigned had been mapped.<p>The maps, which range from highly detailed color compositions to rough sketches done in pencil, are displayed as they were originally drawn. Although created for practical military use rather than as works of art, some of the maps possess great beauty -- something that holds true across the media used to draw and illustrate them.<p>One of many interesting sections of <b>Maps and Mapmakers of the Civil War</b> details the lives of the mapmakers who served in the armies of both the North and the South. The text illustrates the daily activities of the mapmaker and discusses the topographical details they looked for when composing maps.<p>One of the mapmakers discussed in detail is George Armstrong Custer. His West Point training included several hundred hours of study in mapping and topographical engineering. As such, it is no surprise that at the onset of the Civil War Custer was appointed as an assistant engineer on the staff of the army's chief topographical engineer, A.A. Humphreys. A colored pencil map created by Custer is included.<p>The majority of the maps are reproduced as close to their original size as possible, although due to size constraints only portions of some oversized maps could be displayed. One such example is Jed Hotchkiss's theater map of the Gettysburg campaign.  This map is of great historical significance because it was utilized by Robert E. Lee as he directed the march of the Army of Northern Virginia into Pennsylvania. One wishes that the book might have shown maps of such historical significance in their full splendor.<p>This finely crafted album provides an insightful examination of the crucial role that maps and the men who crafted them played in the waging of battle, and ultimately in the outcome of the Civil War.<p><i>William (Mac) E.

1860	157249199X		Civil War Hostages: Hostage Taking in the Civil War		Garrison, Webb			"During the Great War, submarine conflict was less a game of cat-and-mouse than of political finger pointing between the British and German governments. Britain accused Germany of purposely sinking neutral ships. British warships, however, had given the Germans ample room for error. They not only flew neutral flags in an attempt to ward off destruction but received blatant orders (written in typically noncommittal Lloyd-Georgian language) in 1915 to deceive the Germans by disguising themselves as noncombatants. <p> The early stages of hostage taking during the Civil War, detailed in the late Webb Garrison's <b>Civil War Hostages</b>, were framed by a similar conflict. Privateers had been instrumental in winning American independence almost a century before, and in April 1861, reasoning that the Confederacy was free under international law to license privateers, Jefferson Davis proclaimed that letters of marque would be offered for ""private armed vessels"" willing to prey upon Yankee shipping in exchange for a share of the profits. <p> For Abraham Lincoln, there would be no repeat of the Revolutionary War. Two days after Davis's statement, Lincoln issued one of his own. As he refused to recognize the Confederacy's secession, any persons harassing the Union blockade under the ""pretended authority"" of the Rebel states would be ""held amenable to the laws of the United States for the prevention and punishment of piracy."" <p> Faced with the possibility of captured privateers being executed, the Confederate government decided to use Union prisoners of war as hostages. Captured Yankees were selected and their lives placed on the line - if a Confederate privateer were killed, the Union counterpart would die, too. The first big prison ""lottery"" to select such hostages was held in November 1861, at Ligon Prison, Richmond. Congressman Alfred Ely of New York, captured at Manassas, was forced to draw 13 names. Such Confederate ploys eventually worked, and formed the basis for the hostage and prisoner exchanges that would occur throughout the War. <p> Garrison vividly details various accounts of high seas intrigue and other incidents of Civil War hostage taking in a breezy, anecdotal, and highly readable style. Recounting obscure tales like the exploits of ""Zarvona"" (the Confederate colonel who allegedly hijacked ships while disguised as a woman), the various attempts to seize government officials such as Davis and Lincoln as POWs, the desperate hostage scheme to save Charleston in 1864, and how men tried to hold hostage Lincoln's corpse in 1868, <b>Civil War Hostages</b> rarely fails to hold the reader's interest. <p> <i>Sean Salai, editor of</i> The Wabash Commentary, <i>prepared this review while in residence at the Institute for Political Journalism at Georgetown University.</i>"	Salai, Sean	Summer 2000	2000-06-01	Review	Hostage taking provided lucrative political capital	Bounty and ransom	White Mane Publishing Company	36678				"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=238 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/WebbGarrsionCivilWarHostages.jpg"">"

1094	157003348X		A Fire-Eater Remembers: The Confederate Memoir of Robert Barnwell Rhett		Davis, William C.	Rhett, Robert Barnwell		"Even the title of Robert Barnwell Rhett's incomplete memoir breathes a kind of ideological fanaticism: ""The Last Decade, seen in the extinction of Free Government in the United States, and the Downfall of the Southern Confederacy, in connexion with political Life and Services of the Honorable Robert Barnwell Rhett."" Rigid, contentious, and breathtakingly egotistical, Rhett made other southern fire-eaters seem almost calm and restrained by comparison. <p> Born into an eminent family - whose name was changed from Smith to Rhett in 1837 - he became a prosperous planter whose real passion was politics, or more precisely political argument. While still in his twenties, Rhett became a fervent nullifier committed to an austere 18th-century republicanism that would shape his entire career. <p> A restless disciple of John C. Calhoun, he flirted with disunion almost from the beginning of his political life and certainly earned the sobriquet, ""Father of Secession."" Service in both the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate failed to temper his fanatical devotion to South Carolina as the epitome of free government rightly understood. His vision was at once narrow and intense, his polemics both sharply honed and wildly off base. <p> This unfinished apologia bristles with a maddening mix of unfounded assertions, misleading information, endless paragraphs, and self-pitying cant. The most unattractive features of Rhett's mind and personality crop up on nearly every page. Although Rhett began working on the manuscript shortly after the Civil War, it remained in an incomplete and fragmentary state at the time of his death - a rambling and bitter epitaph that served neither its author nor his cause particularly well. <p> William C. Davis has meticulously gone through the various versions of Rhett's memoir, carefully noted textual alterations, and has attempted to fashion it into a coherent book. Davis terms the work ""arrogant,"" an apt-enough description that some readers may consider too mild. Although Rhett often wrote about himself in the third person, this futile effort at literary detachment was an affectation and sham because, in his own mind, he could always boil down any knotty problems into a series of clear principles. The only catch was that his beloved Southland failed to recognize and take advantage of his profound wisdom. At the outset of his memoir, Rhett informed readers that he would tell the unvarnished truth about how the Confederacy was created and who caused its downfall. <p> <b>No use for party politicians</b> <p> Like other South Carolina radicals, Rhett had no use for party politicians and harshly criticized northern Democrats for embracing what he saw as a ""consolidationist"" view of government. That such a description has little basis in reality seemed of trivial consequence. Always sensitive to the smallest encroachments of power on liberty, Rhett made other southern constitutional hairsplitters appear lax and pliable. In print as in life, he shunned diplomatic niceties and preferred to assail his enemies with the bludgeon rather than the stiletto. Like all too many Confederate memoirs, notably those of Jefferson Davis and Alexander Stephens, this book often makes for dry reading, especially when the author harps on some constitutional fine point. <p> According to Rhett, secessionists were only resisting the unconstitutional encroachment of a tyrannical majority, though he did concede that Southerners were also responding to attacks on slavery. Yet in attempting to portray himself as the most important of the Confederate founding fathers - and indeed the champion of free trade and various other reforms in the Confederate constitution - he failed to acknowledge his own disappointment with the document. He never mentioned how he had pushed for reopening the African slave trade, for repealing the Federal Constitution's three-fifths clause so as to increase representation of areas with large numbers of slaves, and for barring the admission of free states to the new southern nation. Nor did he discuss how his fellow delegates to the Montgomery convention rejected these extreme proposals and repudiated Rhett's efforts to assume leadership of the fledgling nation. At one point he concedes that ""slavery was the issue"" that drove the two sections apart but then quickly adds, echoing both Alexis de Tocqueville and Calhoun, that the North was attempting to destroy the basis of free government by establishing a tyranny of the majority. <p> <b>Thoroughly unreliable history</b> <p> As a piece of history, Rhett's work is thoroughly unreliable. Davis's notes, amplifying and more often correcting false and misleading statements, take up nearly half as much space as the memoir itself. In addition, Rhett's animus against Jefferson Davis colors nearly the entire work. To Rhett, Davis had always seemed too moderate, a man whose heart was never in the cause of southern independence. Rhett, however, never acknowledges his own thwarted ambition, a firm belief that he deserved to be the first president of the Confederate States of America. Because of bitter disappointment and sheer pique, Rhett began a relentless campaign to undermine the new administration, even raising objections to buying furniture for the executive mansion in Richmond. <p> Besides castigating Davis for relying too much on the power of ""King Cotton"" to force the European powers into granting diplomatic recognition to the Confederacy, Rhett engaged in persistent second-guessing on military affairs. Davis stands accused of neglecting vigorous preparation to obtain arms and ammunition in the War's early months. Like many an armchair strategist, Rhett claimed that the Confederates could have easily advanced on Washington after the victory at First Manassas. But such opportunities were often squandered by a pigheaded commander in chief determined to ride roughshod over Congress through the use of executive patronage, secret sessions, and his veto pen. Even on naval affairs, Rhett considered himself a fount of wisdom. <p> In order to make his case against Davis, Rhett frequently distorts, omits, and exaggerates, but then accuses the president of propounding various falsehoods. At one point, editor Davis puckishly remarks, ""Suffice it to say that if [Jefferson] Davis had somehow enabled his armies to walk on water, Rhett would only have attacked him for getting the soldiers' stockings wet."" <p> During the War and often in the editorial columns of the <i>Charleston Mercury</i>, Rhett called for vigorous war policies, but even when he acknowledged the necessity of conscription, he still offered constitutional quibbles and blamed Davis for making such a draconian measure necessary. From the first, Rhett had opposed secret congressional sessions - primarily on the grounds that such practices prevented the people from appreciating his wise counsel and brilliant speeches. He hated being out of the political spotlight, which may explain why he finally sought reelection to the Confederate Congress in 1863 even though he stood little chance of winning. If returned to Richmond, he planned to push for Davis's impeachment but the voters decided that it was Rhett who was unfit for office. <p> In Rhett's memoir, the president received full blame for the Gettysburg campaign plan, the loss of Vicksburg, and nearly every other military disaster. After the War, the old fire-eater was in contact with both Joseph E. Johnston and P.G.T. Beauregard, and their strong prejudices merely fed his venom against the administration. Had Rhett been designing a headstone for the Confederacy, it would have read: ""Died of Davis."" <p> The collapse of the southern nation, according to Rhett, marked the eclipse of free government. The tyrannical Abraham Lincoln deserved assassination, and even the conservative Andrew Johnson did not win the Carolinian's favor. In the final pages, Rhett offered a long diatribe against the postwar constitutional amendments as the epitome of despotism. To the embittered fire-eater, the Reconstruction years culminated in an unholy alliance of northern ""oligarches"" and southern ""money-makers."" <p> Yet he also predicted - abruptly shifting tone and torturing logic - that in another 30 years, southern whites would once again be ""masters"" of their own destinies, and one wonders if he even expected slavery to be magically reborn. However that may be and however unattractive Rhett's views and prejudices, we are in William C. Davis's debt for bringing this most unusual document into print and helping us reenter the strange world of Robert Barnwell Rhett. <p> <i>George C.

1842	684856336		Beyond the Battlefield: The Ordinary Life and Extraordinary Times of the Civil War Soldier		Madden, David			Every year hundreds of books are published recounting the story of this or that battle, of one or another officer. Some of the works bring to light stories never before written; others reveal another perspective on an oft-told tale. But in <b>Beyond the Battlefield</b>, David Madden offers a fascinating glimpse at the every day existence of Civil War soldiers. This glimpse invites us to get to know the men better, offering details that have been obscured by the usual focus on troop movements, battle tactics, famous officers, and statistics. By quoting heavily from soldiers' wartime journals and postwar memoirs, Madden uncovers the humanity behind the numbers. <p> <b>Beyond the Battlefield</b>, reminiscent of classic soldier memoirs, tells the story of life between the battles. However, instead of the perspective of a single soldier remembering the experiences of a single regiment, we are treated to a montage of soldiers, North and South, officers and enlisted men. Using wonderful, evocative quotes from a variety of primary sources, the book lets the soldiers speak for themselves, thus providing a vibrant connection to the men. <p> We rejoice with them as they play a rousing game of town ball, we grieve with them over the death of a child at home, we feel the excitement of a new recruit, and we resign ourselves to the brave reserve of a prisoner of war. We train with them in camp and listen to songs and stories around the campfire. We forage for food and endure the privations of the weather and the march. <p> Madden brings us into the hospitals to sit by the bedsides of the dying and lets the men tell their dreams of loved ones and home. <b>Beyond the Battlefield</b> guides us through the universal story of the soldier as every man. <p> <b>Beyond the Battlefield</b> looks honestly at the soldiers, allowing them to celebrate their strengths and to bare their flaws. In return, they allow us to be voyeurs as they struggle to answer that age-old question: how do men retain their humanity amidst the inhumanity of war? <p> <i>Meg Galante-DeAngelis is a lifelong student of the human side of the Civil War period.

1399	1567920799		The Sacrificial Years:  A Chronicle of Walt Whitman's Experiences in the Civil War	Sacrificial Years:  A Chronicle of Walt Whitman's Experiences in the Civil War The	McElroy, John Harmon			"Excluding his poetic record of the war years in <i>Drum Taps</i> and elsewhere, John Harmon McElroy in <b>The Sacrificial Years: A Chronicle of Walt Whitman's Experiences in the Civil War</b> offers a larger selection than has heretofore been made of Whitman's prose record of his life, thoughts, and emotions as recorded in his war and postwar ""memoranda,"" ""wartime letters,"" newspaper pieces, memoirs, and notebooks. <p>In contrast to his younger brother George -- who, before ending the final months of the war as a ""Secesh"" prisoner, had seen action from Second Bull Run to Cold Harbor and Petersburg with the 51st New York Volunteers and had been promoted through the ranks to the rank of lieutenant colonel -- the self-published and as yet relatively obscure author of <i>Leaves of Grass</i> (first edition, 1855), still held the unofficial civilian rank of ""Army Hospital Visitor."" He had conferred this rank on himself in 1863 shortly after he had volunteered his services in the Union military hospitals in the Washington, D.C., area in January of that year. <p>It has usually been assumed that Whitman considered his role in the hospitals equivalent to that of a ""volunteer nurse."" In his excellent editorial introduction to <b>The Sacrificial Years</b>, McElroy is following convention when he says that impressive in physical appearance, ""gregarious and generous,"" possessing ""an in-stinctive knack for how another person's stress might be relieved,"" Whitman had the qualifications that make a good practical nurse, and ""was trusted and liked by the doctors and regular nurses in the wards he visited."" <p>But in his own account of his wartime activities Whitman appears to have been a nurse more nearly in the metaphorical than in the literal sense. In fact, when he characterized the kind of dedicated attention he gave to wounded and sick soldiers as being ""a trade, an art"" that demanded ""experience and natural gifts, and the greatest judgment,"" he had in mind not his skill in meeting the practical medical needs of patients, but the distinction between himself and the generality of visitors. They went ""from curiosity -- as to a show of animals."" <p>The patients (to whom Whitman often brought ""improper things"") failed to realize what Whitman believed he himself was uniquely capable of understanding -- namely, that it is not the mere giving of gifts that does good. Instead, it is the capacity to make the ""proper adaptation"" to the situation of each patient, nothing being ""of any avail"" among the sick and wounded soldiers except the conscientious personal investigation of each case ""with sharp critical faculties,"" yet ""in the fullest spirit of human sympathy and boundless love.""<p>Four years in military hospitals<p>Abandoning the literary life he had led in New York, Whitman supported himself in Washington chiefly by a succession of part-time jobs in the Office of the Army Paymaster, the Indian Bureau, and the Office of the Attorney General. Spending as much time as he possibly could for four years, day and night, in the military hospitals, he attempted to fulfill the overwhelming task of dealing with the individual situations of ""his thousands"" of ""dear boys."" Black or white, Union or ""Secesh"" (i.e., hospitalized prisoners of war), he talked to them, read to them, wrote letters for them, or simply sat in silence, sometimes touching them, while they suffered, and not infrequently, died. <p>Whenever he could, he brought them little gifts of sweets, fruit, tobacco, etc. he had purchased with his own meager funds. ""I get very much attached to some of them,"" he wrote, ""and many of them have come to depend on seeing me . . . as if for their lives."" He even on occasion took up ""his quarters in the hospital, slept or watch'd there several nights in succession."" <p>Whitman tried to hide from himself, as well as the soldiers to whom he ministered, the terrible strain his experience in the hospitals placed on him, but at times he acknowledged it in his memoranda. ""It is curious,"" he confided to himself in 1863, ""when I am present at the most appalling things -- deaths, operations, sickening wounds (perhaps full of maggots) -- I do not fail, although my sympathies are very much excited, but keep singularly cool; but often hours afterward, perhaps when I am at home or out walking alone, I feel sick and actually tremble when I recall the thing and have it in my mind again."" <p>Psychic, physical costs led to stroke<p>The psychic and physical cost of the hospital years was ""hospital malaria"" and a breakdown in Whitman's robust health that led eventually, it would seem, to the partially incapacitating stroke he suffered in 1873. A primary merit of <b>The Sacrificial Years</b> is that it makes possible a more exhaustive examination of Whitman's motives in dedicating himself to four difficult years as an Army Hospital Visitor than any prior collection affords. <p>A somewhat questionable merit of McElroy's collection is the placing of documentary materials not specifically dated in a month-by-month, year-by-year time sequence. This, the editor says, makes for a ""diary-like narrative,"" or, as the subtitle of the collection indicates, with somewhat more precision, a journal-like narrative. <p>Yet if the mingling of accounts of events that may clearly be seen to have been set down at the time they occurred and accounts obviously drawn from recollection is a violation of strict scholarly propriety, we may well feel that the editorial license taken in <b>The Sacrificial Years</b> is justified by its enhancement of the drama of Whitman's profound involvement in the crisis of the American Civil War. <p>""I now doubt,"" Whitman wrote after he had begun his service in the military hospitals, ""whether one can get a fair idea of what this war practically is, or what genuine America is, and her character, without some such experience as this I am having."" <p>Transcendent confirmation of poems' assertions<p>His Civil War service as an Army Hospital Visitor involved not only the experience of discovering the war to be the unfolding of the ""genuine"" identity of the American Republic; it also involved the experience of discovering his war service afforded transcendent confirmation of the equation between national identity and self-identity that, as the self-proclaimed poet-prophet of the American Republic, he had asserted in the first edition of <i>Leaves of Grass</i>. <p>Before he saw the war, Whitman said in retrospect, ""I had hours of doubt about These States; but not since."" To him it seemed that most of his boys ""develop'd, transcended, in personal qualities -- and, radically, in moral ones -- all that the most enthusiastic Democratic-Republican ever fancied, idealized, in loftiest dreams."" And ""curious as it may seem,"" he added, ""the War, to me, proved Humanity, and proved America and the Modern.""  <p>Whitman was fully aware that it might seem ironic -- ""curious"" was the word he used -- to project such a vision of the meaning of the Civil War when he was ""perfectly well aware of the corruption and wickedness"" in America he condemned so memorably in <i>Democratic Vistas</i>. But we detect a greater irony in Whitman's failure to imagine the unfolding of the national and world historical implications of a war that, in joining for the first time political power and the novel power of modern industrial technology, created the complex motives and horrors of ""the great slaughterhouse"" of the Civil War. <p>Did Whitman altogether fail to realize the implication that the conflict which has been called the first modern war was an anticipation of the great slaughterhouses of the twentieth century? Or did he simply choose not to say so? In one graphic moment, to be sure, in his postwar reflections (not included in McElroy's edition) Whitman, it would seem, did say so indirectly. In a sense betraying his vocation to imagine the world in words, he declared that ""the real war will never get in the books.""<p><i>Lewis P.

Feel the past come alive and discover what it was like to grow up during the Civil War. David C. King's <b>Civil War Days</b> follows two families during 1862: the Parkhursts, a white family living in Charleston, South Carolina, and the Wheelers, a black family who escaped slavery and made their way to New York City. <p>But King doesn't simply provide general family portraits, he fills their home lives with an assortment of projects and activities. <p>These are well developed and easy to follow, clearly illustrated, and, most importantly, varied -- perfect for 8- to 12-year-olds of today. A pressed-flower scrapbook, toy parachute, gingerbread recipe, yarn doll, jarabadash, a game of strategy, dried apple rings, and potato-print wrapping paper are just some of the featured activities. Interspersed throughout are short articles that put all this fun in perspective -- offering historical background -- as well as a glossary and bibliography.<p>Activity, not history book<p><b>Civil War Days</b> is essentially an activity and not a history book. The activities tend to overshadow the history presented, and readers might find it difficult to follow the events that led to the Civil War and those that added to its tension. (The events surrounding the formation of the 54th Massachusetts Regiment that Solomon Wheeler joins are especially confusing.) A detailed map and timeline would have helped readers develop a clearer sense of Civil War history.<p>Readers also might find it difficult to relate to both families, especially the children. The Parkhursts and Wheelers are not based on real people. Their joys are not felt, and their strug-gles are solved too easily. Their situations are not believable. <p>The Parkhursts, whose shipping business is closed down because of the war, are able to open a mill in their warehouse with about 20 helpers. They even manage sometimes to get a ship out of the blockaded Charleston harbor. <p>The Wheelers, who do not experience any tension in the North, find work on the docks and in a general store, sell newspapers, and live somewhat comfortably in a small three-room apartment. <p>The black-and-white drawings that illustrate the families' lives and the historical prints that accompany some of the short articles do little to bring the past to life. But <b>Civil War Days</b> does offer its readers a different perspective of the Civil War. Readers catch a glimpse of life off the battlefield and can actively participate in that life.<p><b>Civil War Days</b> is part of the <i>American Kids in History Series</i>.

1400	807123404		Soldier of Tennessee: General Alexander P. Stewart and the Civil War in the West	Soldier of Tennessee: General Alexander P. Stewart and the Civil War in the West	Elliott, Sam Davis			"Few names of Confederate officers who served in the Army of Tennessee come more quickly to mind than that of Alexander P. Stewart. ""Old Straight,"" as he was affectionately called by his men, was an aggressive, hard-hitting, no-nonsense type of soldier who won renown on many bloody fields of battle.<p>From Shiloh to Perryville, Murfreesboro to Chickamauga, and Chattanooga to Atlanta, he fought with courage and consummate skill. A man devoted to duty, he suffered along with his men in the disastrous advance into Tennessee in 1864 and was with them to the bitter end in North Carolina. A professional soldier by training, he graduated 12th out of 56 cadets in the West Point Class of 1842, which included future generals such as James Longstreet and William S. Rosecrans. <p>A Tennessean by birth, he cast his lot with the Confederacy and during the Civil War rose steadily through the ranks from colonel in charge of a regiment to lieutenant general in command of a corps. Through it all, he was steadfast, courageous, and indomitable in spirit and earned the respect and admiration of friend and foe alike.<p>Yet, this extraordinary soldier remains largely unknown to students of the Civil War -- shrouded in mystery except to those intimately familiar with the history of the Army of Tennessee. Unlike many of his contemporaries who were embroiled in the constant controversies which surrounded the army's high command, Stewart remained aloof and free from political maneuvering. <p>Perhaps in part for this reason he has failed to garner the attention of historians. Despite his sterling military performance, service as an educator in the years which followed the war, and work as the Confederate representative on the Chickamauga-Chattanooga National Military Park Commission, he faded into obscurity.<p>Sam Elliott, a lawyer from Chattanooga, provides us with the first in-depth analysis of this key figure since publication of <i>General A. P. Stewart: His Life and Letters</i> by Marshall Wingfield in 1954. Elliott has combined a passion for history with the dogged research skills of his profession to reveal a most gallant warrior and teacher. His is a masterfully written, smooth flowing narrative that traces the life of this prominent figure and argues convincingly that such obscurity is undeserved. Unlike Wingfield's earlier biography, Elliott attempts to analyze Stewart's role in the war and his performance in the many battles in which he fought, and in so doing has produced a rich and fast-paced account of the war in the West. <p>Regrettably, Stewart left few papers, and there is no large collection of his writings available from which to draw an intimate understanding of the man and the influences of family, friends, and environment that shaped his early life. Thus the public figure with whom we are most familiar appears to be a man of great complexity and contradiction. Despite the challenge posed by a paucity of papers, Elliott valiantly attempts to unravel this personality. <p>The author paints a portrait of a humble, yet proud man who was ever mindful of the well-being of those entrusted to his care, be they soldiers or students. His deep faith, which was practiced in every aspect of life, even on the field of battle, earned for him universal acclaim. Stewart was respected by his peers for ""quiet competence,"" and few in an army in which politics was high science begrudged his advancement.<p>In the preface to his work, Sam Elliott refers to the bronze statue of Stewart that stands in front of the Hamilton County Courthouse in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Although the statue is in sight of where the general and his men fought with grim determination in the fall of 1863 to stem the onrushing tide of Federal soldiers who stormed Missionary Ridge, it ""is noticed by few -- an ornament ignored by most people who walk by it."" Elliott laments that, ""Only children and tourists from out-of-state seem to really look"" at the statue. From now on, thanks to Elliott and the publication of Soldier of Tennessee, Alexander P. Stewart will be more than a statue.<p><i>Terrence J.

1395	809322665		The Class of 1861: Custer, Ames, and Their Classmates After West Point		Kirshner, Ralph			"Following the members of a particular West Point class through their military careers is rapidly becoming a sub-genre in military history. Ralph Kirshner's <b>The Class of 1861</b> is the latest addition to the field. In the same vein as such books as John C. Waugh's <i>The Class of 1846</i>, Kirshner traces the fortunes of a United States Military Academy class through the Civil War and beyond. In 1861, West Point graduated both upper classes in a rush to provide officers for the armies forming throughout the Union, releasing such men as Adelbert Ames and George Custer for active service. Future Confederate commanders such as John Pelham and Thomas Rosser departed before graduation.<p>Kirshner has written what he terms a ""collective autobiography,"" using the letters, diaries, and other works of the members of the class to construct a narrative of the War. This attempt forms the first half of the book; in the second half, the author provides a series of very brief essays on the postwar lives of selected members of the class. An appendix supplies further biographical sketches of every member of the class. Also included are photos of the class of 1861 cadets, presented in order of class standing.<p><b>The Class of 1861</b> does not burden the reader with the sort of analysis found in academic works, nor does it examine in depth the factors that made the military experience of these men distinctive. Throughout the first half of the book, Kirshner wisely stands fast in his decision to let the participants tell their own stories, even if he does so by means of long block quotations strung together with the barest possible narrative. Some passages are merely eccentric. In his discussion of the death of John Pelham, he notes that Jeb Stuart announced the death in a general order that ""gave Pelham a place in the <i>Dictionary of Military and Naval Quotations</i>."" When Kirshner finally does comment on his subjects in the second half of the book, he says little of substance. The short chapters on selected members of the class of 1861 are very brief and fail to provide sufficient discussion and examination of their postwar careers.<p>Despite its focus on an interesting topic, <b>The Class of 1861</b> disappoints. This work possesses good sources, interesting subjects, and thorough illustrations, yet never really comes together as a book. Although cloaked in material about the United States Military Academy class of 1861, Kirshner has written nothing more than yet another conventional narrative of the War.<p><i>Mitchell McNaylor is a writer living in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.</i>"	McNaylor, Mitchell	Winter 2000	1999-12-01	Review	After Sumter, West Point's cadets divided	Class act	Southern Illinois University Press	0000-00-00				"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=235 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/KirshnerTheClassof1861.jpg"">"

1825	786408049		The 151st Pennsylvania Volunteers at Gettysburg: Like Ripe Apples in a Storm		Dreese, Michael A.			For a regimental history to have an impact on historical literature the author must convey the wider range of events surrounding a battle or campaign. Placing a regiment in proper historical context, describing actions of other units involved, and defining the general military situation are essential components to an exemplary regi-mental history. Michl A. Dreese admirably accomplishes this in <b>The 151st Pennsylvania Volunteers at Gettysburg: Like Ripe Apples in a Storm</b>.<p>Dreese's opening chapter is devoted to organizational information. Excerpts from recruits' letters provide insight into why the 151st's men enlisted; they often expressed a desire to preserve the nation and to defend their native state. One officer writes of his fear that if the Union is not preserved then other states might follow the course of secession. The officer and the entire regiment understood the severity of the situation facing them. The author's selection of passages provides a context through which the reader is able to appreciate the regiment's later tenacity. <p>By the time of Gettysburg, many units on both sides were battle hardened from earlier campaigns. The men of the 151st , in contrast, were not seasoned veterans; while there were some men with prior military experience, the majority entered service with backgrounds in teaching, lumbering, farming, and other skilled trades. Organized in the latter part of 1862, from the counties of Warren, Snyder, Juniata, Schuylkill, Berks, Susquehanna, and Pike, some of the regiment's men may have wondered if they ever would see action. Other regiments in the brigade doubted how they would fight. <p>In the following chapter, Dreese sets the stage, outlining the Army of the Potomac's pursuit of the Army of Northern Virginia into Pennsylvania. It is described in such a way that the reader can sense the immensity of the impending battle.<p>The book then flows into Gettysburg's first day. Dreese masterfully recounts the fighting involving the 151st and other regiments in its brigade on McPherson's Ridge (the 151st was part of Biddle's Brigade, 3rd Division, First Corps). Dreese includes accounts of the fighting on McPherson's Ridge from the perspective of the attacking North Carolinians as well, which helps provide a balanced view of the clash.<p><b>Key role in Pickett's Charge</b><p>The climax of <b>The 151st Pennsylvania Volunteers at Gettysburg</b> comes with the climax of the battle, Pickett's Charge. The 151st, positioned to the left of center on Cemetery Ridge, played a key role in the repulse. The author once again does a fine job of telling the story, paying attention to the overall military situation. In the final pages, the reader learns of the horrors experienced by unfortunate men in field hospitals or en route to one of the wretched prisons of the South. Dreese concludes with the postwar lives of the survivors.<p>Numerous maps and photographs provide a visual aid to the epic struggle. While before Gettysburg the 151st  was virtually untried, it proved itself in its native Keystone State. Michl A. Dreese has written the first history of the 151st Pennsylvania Volunteers, providing overdue tribute to a regiment that suffered over 70 percent casualties at Gettysburg. He also has delivered a valuable tool for studying one of the most ferocious battles of the American Civil War.<p><i>Jonathan A.

1754	807125350		To the North Anna River		Rhea, Gordon C.			"For most who study Civil War military history, Grant's Overland campaign from May 1864 until the end of the War seems an inexorable and inevitable advance from Washington to Appomattox. Grant, called ""the butcher"" by some because of the devastating casualties sustained by his Army of the Potomac, has the reputation of a ""bull-dozer"" general who overcame enemies by dogged single-mindedness and overwhelming numbers.<p>But the campaign was much more complex than that, as author and attorney Gordon C. Rhea teaches us in his new work on the Overland campaign, <b>To the North Anna River</b>.<p>Believing that the 40 days of initial battles between Lee and Grant, from the Rapidan River to the James, was ""the most exciting period in the Civil War,"" Rhea began this series of books with <i>The Battle of the Wilderness, May 5-6, 1864</i> (Louisiana State University Press, ISBN 0807118737, $34.95 hardcover), and progressed through <i>The Battles for Spotsylvania Court House and the Road to Yellow Tavern, May 7-12, 1864</i> (Louisiana State University Press, ISBN 0807121363, $34.95 hardcover) to this book on the North Anna campaign, perhaps the most interesting segment of the campaign. <p>Through Rhea's outstanding research, duplicating and even surpassing the efforts in his previous books, we learn far more about the high command of both armies than has ever been addressed in one place, from the friction in the command structure of the Army of the Potomac to the near-awe by Grant's officers of Lee's fighting prowess, from Lee's oft-demonstrated ability to seize the initiative and force the offensive to Grant's decision to change his bulldozer tactics and convert the conflict into a match of maneuver. Both sides, of course, continued to inflict horrendous casualties on the other -- the difference was that Grant's losses could be, and were, replaced.<p>Rhea's style is at once readable and complex, allowing experienced readers and novices alike to understand the complexity of the two aggressive and able generals, who were beset by various problems including a command structure still mired in the 18th century.<p>As these two captains of war led their armies through a series of chess-like moves across Spotsylvania and Caroline counties until the forces found themselves staring at one another across the North Anna River, Lee forced Grant to split his army in half to get around the wedge-shaped formation of the Army of Northern Virginia. The writing on the crumbling gray wall continues: Rhea will complete the series with books on Cold Harbor, and the crossing of the James that began the race for Petersburg. <p><b>To the North Anna River</b> is an excellent history of one segment of a much longer cam-paign, with impeccable research leading to some new conclusions. Those interested in the road to Appomattox will overlook this excellent series at their own peril -- and loss. <p><i>Jerry L.

1865	1572330732		Confederate Engineer: Training and Campaigning with John Morris Wampler		Kundahl, George G.			"For several centuries, combat engineers have played a crucial role in battle operations. Yet the typical battles and leaders approach to the Civil War usually pays little attention to this important work. George G. Kundahl attempts to fill the void with <b>Confederate Engineer: Training and Campaigning with John Morris Wampler</b>. Though Wampler had no spectacular achievements during the War, the book serves as a good introduction to what daily life must have been like for a Civil War engineer. <p> Raised in Northern Virginia and given a liberal arts education, at age 17 Wampler obtained a position with the U.S. Coast Survey, one of the nation's most ambitious antebellum scientific enterprises. His experience there gave him cartographic expertise and allowed him to travel throughout the country, especially in the South. <p> When war broke out, Wampler was working as a civil engineer in Baltimore. He cast his lot with his home state, and his engineering background made him a hot commodity in the agrarian Confederacy. Early in the War he made a series of maps for General P.G.T. Beauregard and must have made a good impression on the general. In 1862, Wampler was transferred to Beauregard's command at Corinth, Mississippi. <p> His service there under Beauregard and Beauregard's successor, Braxton Bragg, shows the wide variety of duties expected of a Civil War engineer and the gradual transition of a civilian engineer to a combat engineer. Wampler and his fellow engineers were expected to make maps; reconnoiter; repair and build fortifications, roads, bridges, and railroads; remove and construct impediments to attack; and be prepared to serve as reserves in battle. <p> In the summer of 1863, Beauregard summoned him once more, this time to help repair and design fortifications at Charleston. It was there on August 17, 1863, that Wampler was killed instantly by a Federal shell. <p> <b>Confederate Engineer</b> is more a biography than an edited document. While we sometimes hear Wampler's voice, we more often hear Kundahl's interpretation of that voice. Despite this, the book serves as a Confederate companion to New York Colonel Wesley Brainerd's memoir  Bridge Building in Wartime. <p> That Kundahl is Wampler's great-great- grandson might initially concern some readers, who may fear a fawning treatment or too much trivial information of interest only to family members. But Kundahl handles Wampler in a mostly unbiased way, noting his failures and even allowing the possibility of an extramarital liaison. <p> An unusual aspect of the book is a chapter describing the tribulations of Wampler's wife Kate, stuck with their five children in the dangerous Loudoun County area of Northern Virginia. Irregular units from both sides, sometimes dressed in uniforms of the enemy, traversed the county looking for hidden soldiers or goods worth taking. At one point Mrs. Wampler resorted to hiding her cow in the kitchen to protect her children's milk supply. While this chapter is one of the most interesting parts of the book, its inclusion in the middle of John Morris Wampler's story may be disconcerting to some readers. It might have been better placed as an appendix. <p> Kundahl is a competent writer and the editing is very good. I found only two factual errors: one a simple mathematical error, and the other an assertion that a balloonist seen was ""undoubtedly Prof. Thaddeus S.C. Lowe."" During the time frame in which Wampler saw the balloon, Lowe's rival John LaMountain was also ascending in the area. <p> Readers looking for more concrete information on Confederate combat engineering might do well to search out  First Regiment, Engineer Troops, P.A.C.S. by Harry L. Jackson. And those looking for battlefield action may be a bit disappointed by the lack of actual combat description. <p> But <b>Confederate Engineer</b> will be enjoyed by those who relish reading about the human side of the Civil War. Kundahl does an excellent job of bringing his ancestor back to life and when Wampler is suddenly killed at Morris Island it is hard not to share a sense of loss.  <p> <i>Charles D.

1887	1572330686		Ninety-Eight Days: A Geographer's View of the Vicksburg Campaign		Grabau, Warren E.			"For those Civil War historians who read Ed Bearss's superb works on the Vicksburg campaign and thought that no important details of this watershed action remained to be discovered, Warren Grabau's <b>Ninety-Eight Days: A Geographer's View of the Vicksburg Campaign</b> will provide a delightful surprise. <p> A colleague of Bearss who collaborated with him on much of his Vicksburg writing, Grabau steps out of the shadow to deliver a thorough and important book that stands on its own. It will appeal to historians, geographers, and practitioners of the military art for its engaging style and the degree to which it emphasizes the salient role of geography in the strategic decisions of military commanders. <p> Grabau does a masterful job of articulating how geography influences strategy, logistics, and tactics. He makes the significant distinction that geography does not determine the outcome of war; rather it ""influences the ways in which the campaigns and battles are waged; the Army which exploits the landscape most cleverly is most likely to win."" The author uses Vicksburg to demonstrate that pragmatic commanders like Grant enjoy a distinct advantage if their decisions are underpinned by a full understanding of demographics, topography, hydrology, culture, and other geographic variables. Nevertheless, it is his fine grasp of the military details of the campaign that most intrigues the reader. <p> Military leaders and historians will be fascinated by Grabau's insight into three key areas: the role that personalities and military relationships played on each side, a terrain analysis that explains how geography influenced the Union and Confederate decision-making processes, and the remarkably close cooperation between the Federal army and navy. His description of how Porter anticipated Grant's logistical needs upon his arrival in front of the Vicksburg defenses is but one example of the navy's important role in Grant's overall success. <p> Although the extensive collection of detailed maps in <b>Ninety-Eight Days</b> is both exceptional and fully supportive of the analysis, our single criticism of the work involves map location. Instead of grouping all 68 maps at the end of the book, near an informative endnotes section, it would have benefited readers more to place each map closer to the related text. <p> Warren Grabau is a talented author whose detailed terrain analysis and insight into the major commanders constitute a significant contribution to the study of the Vicksburg campaign. His work illustrates the essential role geography has in the military decision- making process as few books ever do. It is a must read for Civil War historians, military geographers, and military officers of all levels. <p> <i>Kent Hughes Butts is a geographer and professor of political military strategy at the Center for Strategic Leadership, U.S. Army War College.</i> <p> <i>Arthur L.

1099	385473850		1001 Things Everyone Should Know about the Civil War	1001 Things Everyone Should Know about the Civil War	Vandiver, Frank E.			"Frank Vandiver does an admirable job of placing in chronological order the many significant events of the Civil War in such short space. <b>1001 Things</b> rarely wastes words and has achieved balance by treating naval, civilian, and medical matters in addition to purely military aspects of the war. <p>Layout of <b>1001 Things</b> (two columns per page) is superb. It includes many illustrations, some of which have seldom been used before. Unfortunately, many are a bit fuzzy and they carry no credit lines. The comprehensive index greatly adds to usefulness, and clear typography plus lots of white space make for easy reading.<p>The author sometimes challenges orthodoxy, but limited space makes it impossible to buttress verdicts such as the assertion that Beauregard probably saved Richmond in the summer of 1864 ""because he grasped the tactical situation more quickly than Lee did."" Vandiver sometimes indulges in guessing. For example, he says that Albert S. Johnston ""probably died at the right moment for his reputation.""<p>There are provocative paragraphs such as the author's description of Raphl Semmes, followed by terse characterization that begins: ""He had a gentleman's manners but a corsair's heart. . . ."" Readers will also be pleased to discover that new terminology can be effective. Describing part of First Bull Run, Vandiver does not write of Union or Federal or blue-clad cannoneers -- but simply, Blue cannoneers.<p>He relies too heavily upon oral tradition in item #924, however, where General Joseph Hooker's policies are said to have given rise to ""hooker"" as a synonym for ""prostitute."" At least as early as 1859 a strumpet who lived at Corlear's Hook in New York City was termed a hooker in print. <p>Unfortunately, the title seems to have dictated the structure of the work. Numerous numbers for ""things everyone should know"" crop up inside paragraphs. Single sentences deal with some things that should be known, and the author treats one of them (#211) in eight words. This makes it hard to avoid the conclusion that lots of numbers (but not sections of text indicated by them) could be deleted without damaging the work.<p><i>Reared in Covington, Georgia, where Garrard hit in July 1864, Webb Garrison's interest in the Civil War began in childhood...and never stops growing.</i>"	Garrison, Webb	Summer 1999	1999-06-01	Review	A new medley of facts challenges some older accounts	History counts	Doubleday	0000-00-00				"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=199 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/Vandiver1001things.jpg"">"

2221	823219348		The Freedmen's Bureau and Reconstruction: Reconsiderations	Freedmen's Bureau and Reconstruction: Reconsiderations The	Cimbala, Paul A.	Miller, Randall M.		"From July to October 1865, Union Major General Carl Schurz toured the South from Charleston to New Orleans. He inspected a region defeated in war and living amidst appalling physical destruction. Everywhere, he observed a breakdown in law and order and a population close to chaos.<p>Amongst the newly freed, Schurz saw fear, want, and a people whose primary help had to come from the Union forces. Amongst the white population, he noted resentment of the Union army, distaste for the freed people, little loyalty to the United States, and a universal belief that the newly freed would work only under compulsion. While whites grudgingly agreed that the individual black people no longer belonged to individual white people, they believed that black people, in general, still belonged to white people, in general.<p>In this environment the Freedmen's Bureau was expected to educate the newly freed, find them land (and often, work), guarantee their suffrage, establish them in a secure civil status as free persons in a reconstructed society, and do all these things to the satisfaction of both races and both regions in five years.<p>Paul Cimbala and Randall Miller have collected 13 essays in a volume designed to reevaluate the activities of the Bureau, its relative success and failure, its role in Reconstruction, and the social and political context in which it worked. An afterword by James McPherson provides a general reflection upon the Freedmen's Bureau, serving as a counterpoint to essays dealing with more specific aspects of its work.<p>The articles range widely over political and social issues. Two of them deal with the role of President Johnson and General Grant in Bureau affairs, while another examines the role of the Freedmen's Bureau in education in post-emancipation Maryland, which was a Northern state for purposes of war and a Southern state for purposes of slavery. The rest of the contributions cover the South from Virginia to the western frontier of slavery in Texas and Arkansas. Based solidly upon archival research, the essays examine both the day-to-day work of the Bureau and the ideals that animated it. Collectively, they describe the Freedmen's Bureau as a local agency and a national institution, as both an arm of evangelical Protestant idealism and social casework in the trenches.<p>Generally the articles agree on the main problems the Freedmen's Bureau faced. Some were internal, particularly insufficient funding and an inadequate organizational framework. Other problems involved constant presidential hostility and the often-uncertain relationships with the army and civil authorities. Most, however, stemmed from the unrelenting hostility of Southern whites to the Bureau's efforts at education and free citizenship and the white population's equally persistent attempt to have the new system of free labor resemble, as closely as possible, the old system of slavery.<p>Common problems produced common responses by the Freedmen's Bureau, with due allowance for variations in local conditions throughout the South. Everywhere in the 11 defeated states the newly freed congregated around Union army garrisons or in towns, and they needed to be fed, clothed, and housed. The Johnson administration had no intention of becoming a welfare agency, so the Freedmen's Bureau was instructed to get the freed people off Union rations, out of town, and back to work on the plantations. President Johnson pardoned most Confederate leaders, which allowed them to retain or reclaim their pre-War land holdings, and thus little fertile land was available for apportionment to freed people under the legendary 40 acres and a mule program.<p>So the Freedmen's Bureau became primarily an agency of provision, of resettlement, and of policing labor contracts to prevent the imposition of virtual slavery upon the newly freed. Needs of the moment overcame longer range plans for education and full political citizenship. The Freedmen's Bureau, of necessity, functioned as a paternalistic agency, more involved in giving care than in preparing people to care for themselves, and operating as an advocate and mediator for the weak.<p>This is an excellent book, one that every historian interested in Reconstruction should consult. It is also an important book, not merely because it addresses an important topic, but because it deals with that topic in a thoughtful and judicious manner. Buttressed by substantial research, the contributors place the Freedmen's Bureau in its mixed context of great hope and promise amidst equally great destruction and resentment. They present a balanced assessment of ideals and results, concisely summed up by James McPherson in his afterword: ""If the result fell short of entire success, the alternative might well have been total failure.""<p><i>James D.

1468	847694313		Abraham Lincoln: A Constitutional Biography		Anastaplo, George			"George Anastaplo began his career in an unusual fashion. He was a victim of the Illinois Bar Association's aversion to free expression in a First Amendment case, <i>In re Anastaplo</i> (366 U.S. 82 [1961]). He went on to an exceptionally distinguished academic career of sustained publication in law and political theory.  <p> In <b>Abraham Lincoln: A Constitutional Biography</b>, Anastaplo has brought together 17 previous talks and essays into a volume built around the origins of the American republic and Lincoln's constitutional views. The essays are organized in roughly chronological order, beginning with a slave case, <i>The Case of James Sommersett</i> (XX How.1 [1772]) in the prologue, moving to reflections on the Declaration of Independence, the Northwest Ordinance and the Constitutional Convention, and several subjects tied to the early national period. Abraham Lincoln makes his appearance in the eighth essay and Anastaplo concentrates on Lincoln's various speeches, debates, and messages in the next essays, before concluding with a reflection on the president's intellectual legacy. <p> Several philosophical positions tie this wealth of historical, legal, and constitutional analysis together. Central to the entire book is Anastaplo's recognition of the historical importance (and continuing reality) of natural law in the American constitutional system. Complementing the natural law is prudence, the first cardinal virtue and an essential quality for the continuation and success of the republic. A third common theme is the overriding importance of slavery during the years between the American Revolution and the Civil War. Finally the essays acquire unity from an examination of Lincoln's constitutional and philosophical positions as expressed in his more important messages and speeches. <p> Anastaplo centers his examination of natural law in an essay entitled ""The Common Law and the Organization of Government."" He demurs from the standard assertions of American legal realists that the common law is based upon ""experience"" (Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, <i>The Common Law</i>, 1881) or what the judge said it was (John Chipman Gray, <i>The Nature and Sources of Law</i>, 1909) or that the common law ""does not work from pre-established truths of universal . . . validity""(Justice Benjamin Cardozo, <i>The Nature of the Judicial Process</i>, 1921). To the contrary, Anastaplo states on page 74: ""Underlying all of the common law, in addition to the great constitutional rights and civil liberties rooted in historical developments, is a doctrine of natural right, or a sense of natural justice."" <p> He is, of course, absolutely right. The shared cultural sense of natural right prevailing amongst us exists in both jurisprudence and the popular imagination. The ""right thing,"" based, one must suppose, on some concept of natural law, appears to have been decisive in <i>Brown v. Board</i> (347 U.S. 483 [1954]). The appeal of natural right to the popular imagination reveals itself through the constant complaints that lawyers love technicalities and that courts do not do justice, or in the occasional jury nullification, from John Peter Zenger to O.J. Simpson. Indeed, this continuing sense of natural right (<i>The Case of James Sommersett</i>) keeps commonality in the common law. <p> The political importance of the Platonic virtue of prudence is another position advanced by Anastaplo, as prudence must be the constant goal of citizens as they deal with the endless tensions between happiness and virtue, between rights and duty, between the good and the best. Prudence thus defined becomes the most reasonable and ethical political course available, considering actual circumstances as well as theoretical possibilities, and requires the difficult acknowledgment that, as Anastaplo writes on page 166, ""the sensibilities and aspirations of one's opponents are usually entitled to respect."" During the early republic, the great challenge to political prudence came with slavery, which had been limited but not destroyed by the Northwest Ordinance and Constitutional Convention of 1787. It was the best that could be achieved. <p> In the essay ""John C. Calhoun and Slavery,"" Anastaplo acutely describes Calhoun's ambiguous purpose: despite learned constitutional arguments, slavery was the true cause of nullification, interposition, and states' rights. Calhoun's doctrine of interposition denied the political attitudes supposed necessary by the Declaration of Independence, including equality and prudence, implicitly asserting instead that the protection of slavery was the basic purpose of the American polity. <p> <b>Abraham Lincoln: A Constitutional Biography</b> examines Lincoln's major public statements through literary criticism more than legal analysis. Lincoln's inaugural addresses, the July 4, 1861, message to Congress, the Emancipation Proclamation, and the Gettysburg Address are philosophical and often poetic documents, invoking political ideals of liberty, equality, justice, and courage rather than calling for legislative remedy. They appeal to the justification of history and of God, to charity toward all. <p> Ultimately, the statements and their ideals transcend the immediate, illuminating shared community values that tie Lincoln's period (and ours) to the founding of the republic. Anastaplo analyzes them in this larger, ethical and historical context, and suggests on page 255 that Lincoln's ""legacy stands as a barrier against the massive assault by positivism, value-free social science, legal realism, existentialism and relativism to which intellectuals have been routinely subjected in the twentieth century."" <p> This is not a book designed for quick and casual reading. It is intellectually dense, assumes at least an adequate classical education on the part of the reader, and proceeds often by means of Socratic questions that the serious reader will wish to ponder. The text is complemented by nearly 100 pages of notes.  <p> Anastaplo himself comes down firmly on the side of historical perspective, natural law, prudence, and charity, opposing ideological absolutism and a maniacal insistence that all political perfection be obtained immediately. But he presents his views deftly and insists upon inquiry rather than orthodoxy. He has produced a meditation on American politics, Platonic in its focus virtue, historical in its emphasis on prudence, modern in its suggestion that equality is the major continuing problem in American law and social structures -  it is, in short, the product of a lifetime's thought about the American polity. <p> <i>James D.

2025	878331794		Confederate Generals: Life Portraits		Cantor, George			"George Cantor twice refers to Pickett's Charge at Gettysburg: once as ""one of the great feats of valor in all of American warfare,"" and later as ""a display of courage rarely equaled in the history of warfare."" The author himself displays courage in selecting only 16 Confederate generals to highlight in his new work, <b>Confederate Generals: Life Portraits.</b> <p> Civil War historians and buffs will surely have favorites among the 425 men listed in Ezra T. Warner's <i>Generals in Gray</i> that Cantor has omitted. He divides the chosen 16 into five groups: ""The Legends"" are Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson, Joseph Johnston, and James Longstreet; ""The Cavalrymen"" comprise Jeb Stuart, Nathan Bedford Forrest, and John Hunt Mor-gan; ""The Western Commanders"" are Albert Sidney Johnston, John Bell Hood, and Patrick Cleburne; and ""The Difficult Men"" are Jubal Early, Braxton Bragg, and Robert Toombs. Lastly, ""The Eccentrics,"" are P.G.T. Beauregard, Leonidas Polk, and George Pickett. <p> If few will question most of his selections, choices such as Toombs and Pickett may leave readers wondering why Cantor does not ex-plain the basis for their inclusion and classifi-cation in his introduction. In most cases the reason is obvious; in other cases less so. Beauregard and Polk are not ""eccentric"" in the eyes of the people of New Orleans. They fit in there! <p> An experienced newspaperman for <i>The Detroit News</i> with more than 20 books to his credit, Cantor provides the general reader with a well-written introduction to the life and times of notable Confederate leaders. His life portraits provide a sense of the subject's character, pre-Civil War career and family history, and activity during the War and in postwar society. In addition to covering the major military achievements or shortcomings of the generals, he highlights the events that may have shaped each individual's historical reputation. Fine examples are found in the treatment of Forrest's involvement in the Fort Pillow massacre and later the Ku Klux Klan, and Longstreet's postwar affiliation with the Republican party and his ""attack"" upon Lee. <p> Cantor has a keen journalistic eye for the proper quote or pithy phrase to encapsulate an individual or event. His life portraits clearly show the impact that friendships, army service, and domestic politics had upon many of the Confederate generals. He enlivens the narrative by adding asides throughout the text. By relating what Mark Twain said about Helena, Arkansas, the home of Cleburne, or suggesting that Harriet Beecher Stowe may have been inspired to write <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i> after a visit to Albert Johnston's Kentucky home, Cantor sparks the reader's interest. <p> Extensive illustrations show the accelerated aging effect of warfare upon the generals and their antagonists and allies. The battle scenes from the Mexican War and the Civil War, however, are too numerous and do not provide much additional understanding. Image captions read like narrative, making it difficult at first to determine what is being shown. After becoming adjusted to the pattern, however, it is a refreshing change from regular captions. <p> Cantor culls information from the standard works, and from some more recent works as well. For instance, he relies heavily upon William Piston's biography of Longstreet, yet he does not seem to have consulted recent works on Lee or James Robertson's biography of Jackson. Even the older standards such as Charles Roland's work on Albert Johnston or T. Harry Williams's biography of Beauregard are not cited in the text or the bibliography. Overall, Cantor's work reveals little new research. For example, most of the information in his essay on Jackson can be found in Douglas S. Freeman's sketch in the <i>Dictionary of American Biography</i> (1943) and James Robertson's essay in the <i>American National Biography</i> ($2951.50 set). <p> This volume, which lacks footnotes, might not serve those desiring a more scholarly, interpretative work. But for one unfamiliar with the Civil War and its generals, <b>Confederate Generals</b> is an excellent introduction. <p> <i>Wilbur E.

1484	811706826		From Blue to Gray: The Life of Confederate General Cadmus M. Wilcox		Patterson, Gerard A.			"Given Major General Cadmus Marcellus Wilcox's long and combat-rich command tenure with the Army of Northern Virginia, it is curious it took so long for someone to pen his biography. Except for First Manassas, Wilcox was in the thick of the fighting in virtually every major engagement in the Eastern Theater. Although he had the good fortune to avoid enemy bullets, a string of circumstances conspired to deny him opportunities to shine on the battlefield. His career is best described as solid and steady, but unspectacular. This latter description can also be applied to Gerard A. Patterson's new biography. <p> Although he was a native of North Carolina and grew up in Tennessee, Wilcox was tapped early in the war to lead the 9th Alabama Infantry, and later a brigade of Alabamians. The ""very wicked and unpopular but skillful officer,"" as one artillerist described him, crafted his five regiments into one of the Army of Northern Virginia's most reliable brigades. His temporary command of a small division during the Second Manassas campaign was bracketed by brave and determined brigade leadership during the fighting on the Peninsula and in the battles of Sharpsburg, Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville. At Chancellorsville, Wilcox performed what many historians, including Patterson, believe was his most important wartime contribution: his keen observations determined that enemy troops were being withdrawn from Banks' Ford, prompting Wilcox to disregard his orders and rush his men to Fredericksburg and Lee's rear, where his timely arrival may have saved the army from disaster. <p> His good service notwithstanding, Wilcox remained a brigadier in the army's post-Chancellorsville reorganization and turned in a solid performance at Gettysburg with A.P. Hill's Third Corps. The scope of that campaign's losses forced yet another reorganization, and Wilcox was promoted to major general and permanent divisional command. He discharged his duties well during the war's final year at the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and throughout the lengthy Petersburg campaign. After the war, Wilcox lived a quiet existence in Washington, D.C., where he died in 1890. <p> The value of <b>From Blue to Gray</b> lies in the fact that it is the first biography of this significant Army of Northern Virginia officer. It is also something of a paradox, offering as it does interesting anecdotes and private visions from Wilcox's letters wrapped around a core of astonishingly thin detail. For example, Wilcox's important contributions during the Peninsula campaign and Seven Days' battles are covered in a handful of pages that offer little of the perspective necessary to understand what he did and why he did it. His role at the head of a division at Second Manassas is summed up in a single breezy paragraph, while the Chancellorsville campaign opens in a single sentence-without a word of background or explanation-and Stonewall Jackson launches his flank attack in the next. Wilcox's detailed battle reports are only scantily mined, even though readily available. The absence of maps exacerbates this paucity of detail. Patterson's skeletal approach at biography is all the more curious given his long and successful experience with the pen. <p> Patterson's research, which will never be described as exhaustive, has managed to uncover and utilize a number of his subject's letters, which add another dimension to the man many of us know something about, but about whom most of us do not know enough. Unfortunately, we still don't. <p> <i>Theodore P. Savas is the publisher and acquisitions editor of Savas Publishing Company and an attorney living in Northern California.

1919	1882810481		The Final Battles of the Petersburg Campaign: Breaking the Backbone of the Rebellion		Greene, A. Wilson	Sommers, Richard J.		"Given the steady market for Civil War battle studies, the lack of a complete treatment of the individual engagements of the Petersburg campaign is puzzling. There were battle-scale combats during all but two of the months from June 1864 through April 1865, yet just six detailed studies of the 11 major battlefield engagements outside Petersburg have been produced. Most have been small press productions, varying greatly in quality, while the best, Richard Sommers's <i>Richmond Redeemed</i> (Doubleday, 1981) stands alone for its monumental depth, rigorous detail, and non-stop analysis. They are joined now by A. Wilson Greene's fine entry, <b>Breaking the Backbone of the Rebellion</b>, a contribution that lies decidedly on the Sommers end of the scale. <p> This book offers a detailed narrative of the final episodes of the Petersburg campaign, beginning with the March 25 Confederate assault on Union Fort Stedman, and ending with the Union Sixth Corps's penetration of the city's outer defenses on April 2, 1865. The latter is the true focus of this book, perhaps a natural center of attention for an author who presides over the privately operated battlefield park that preserves and interprets the breakthrough site. <p>  The big question throughout the North as spring approached in 1865 was not <i>if</i> but <i>when</i> the final victory would come. Northern leaders feared that the Confederacy would drag its demise into a summer that would be filled with increasingly smaller-scaled actions as Rebel armies fragmented into guerrilla bands. This motivated Ulysses S. Grant to push hard at Petersburg, commencing offensive moves before conventional wisdom deemed the ground firm enough for operations. <p> The basic equation that had preserved the Confederacy there throughout the fall and winter of 1864 had not changed greatly. Lee's forces depended upon their large-scale earthworks to equalize the numbers game with their adversaries, a calculation that held true until the night of April 1. Bolstered by the news of Sheridan's success in defeating George Pickett at Five Forks, Grant ordered something he had refused to consider since the battle of the Crater in July: direct assaults on the enemy's fortified positions. Girded by the resilient optimism that had sustained him throughout 1864, Grant again believed that the enemy had been thinned and demoralized enough that a strong blow would finish the job. He was wrong about the latter, but quite correct regarding the former. <p> Just after dawn on April 2, Union forces surged against Lee's Petersburg lines in two places: on the east side along the Jerusalem Plank Road, and on the west side moving northwesterly from the ""fishhook"" in the Federal fortified lines. The eastern side mired down into bitter trench fighting, but the western wing achieved the great offensive breakthrough of the war. <p> <b>Breaking the Backbone of the Rebellion</b> meets every standard for a modern battle study. It draws from a full range of sources: published material, newspapers, and manuscripts of all kinds. Of course, such sources are of little value unless they are well applied, and Greene handles this mass of material with a sure hand. Nearly every key event has several accounts providing on-the-spot reportage along with those often poignant human interest vignettes that make battles so fascinating. <p> This is a narrative history with a popular bent, strong on story with little space spent providing analytical judgments. Principal officers are introduced with brief biographical sketches that emphasize their military record rather than personality traits. Tactical details are explained when necessary, but, more often than not, the descriptive passages fill that requirement. The book is extensively footnoted, with those annotations providing both source information and, frequently, relating additional commentary. <p> Although this detailed battle study includes maps, there appears to have been a miscommunication between cartographer and book designer, for many of the maps are presented in an obviously reduced size that often obscures the details they are meant to illuminate. It is an unfortunate blemish on an otherwise well-produced volume. <p> The April 2 assault of the Sixth Corps at Petersburg was the charge that ended the Civil War. It was the first falling domino that unerringly led to the last. In A. Wilson Greene, this militarily and historically significant operation has found a sympathetic and skillful chronicler. <p> <i>Noah Andre Trudeau is the author of four Civil War books, three concerning the campaigns of 1864-65 and one a combat history of black troops.</i>"	Trudeau, Noah Andre	Spring 2001	2001-03-01	Review	Union infantry at Petersburg surged on to Richmond	The charge that ended the war	Savas Publishing	36617				"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=244 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/GreeneTheFinalBattlesofthePetersburgCampaign.jpg"">"

1003	847699528	$35.00	A New Birth of Freedom: Abraham Lincoln and the Coming of the Civil War		Jaffa, Harry V.			"Harry V. Jaffa takes his time. The wait is well worth it. Forty-one years separate the publication of Jaffa's recognized classic, Crisis of the House Divided (University of Chicago Press, ISBN 0226391132, $20.00 softcover), and this new work on Abraham Lincoln's political thought. A third volume is anticipated. A distinguished professor of political philosophy, Jaffa approaches texts through an interpretive method he owes to the philosopher Leo Strauss. Strauss, according to Jaffa, ""taught that one must make every attempt to understand a writer as he understood himself."" Pressing this theme when the subject is a powerful political thinker as well as America's greatest president requires engaging the full political implications, in historic context, of Lincoln's complex and eloquent arguments against slavery and for the American constitutional experiment. Jaffa writes in context too, of course, our own age that witnesses strenuous pleas on behalf of radical historicism and moral relativism of the sort Lincoln opposed and Jaffa disdains. <p>When Lincoln is nowadays thought about by those deploying an aggressive form of what is called ""the hermeutics of suspicion,"" the resulting depiction is that of just another 19th century racist whose policies involved sectional interest tied to personal ambition-scarcely the stuff of political heroism and moral nobility. Jaffa acknowledges that Lincoln sometimes deferred to ""ordinary American prejudices"" but that this ""in no wise proves that[he] shared those prejudices."" Besides that, it is conceivable that a human being can set in motion arguments and events that tear up the ground on which prejudicial structures rest and that he can do this quite knowingly, assuming that the full fruits of such ground breaking will not be manifest in his own lifetime.<p> The structure of <b>A New Birth of Freedom</b> proceeds roughly as follows: Jaffa moves through Lincoln's debates with Stephen Douglas to his disputations with, and against, John C. Calhoun. In each case, Lincoln faced a foe Jaffa calls ""historicist"" or ""relativist."" In each case, he countered by deploying the ""idiom of natural rights and natural law,"" a source of moral good and right that has subsequently ""become alien to us."" That this is so represents a clear and present danger to the survival of the American constitutional republic, in Jaffa's view. Lincoln was deeply committed to the premise that ""all men are created equal""-and he included women in this, being by age 27 a supporter of women's suffrage. This premise was applicable to all peoples and all times. A deep and perduring compact between a people and ""nature's God"" involved the recognition, not the arbitrary invention, of the moral equality of all those created in God's image. This ideal was ""no less metaphysical than moral and political,"" being traceable to the fleshing out of the presupposition of moral equality that is, to use Jaffa's strong language on page 151, ""the unassailable premise of Judeo-Christian ethics.""<p> Those-and Jaffa cites them-who found this principle of moral equality ""politically untranslatable,"" an ideal safely reserved to metaphysical speculation, were countered systematically by the foes of ""Csarism"" in politics, including Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln argued insistently that all those who had come to America's shores, even those who were not descendants of the first European settlers and founding generation, had as much right to connect themselves to the premise of the Declaration of Independence as any other; ""they have a right to claim it as though they were blood of the blood, and flesh of the flesh, of the men who wrote that Declaration, and so they are,"" as Lincoln put it in his Chicago speech of July 10, 1858. This premise extended to Africans brought to America's shores as slaves. Even as God delivered the Isrlites from bondage, these latter-day children of bondage will surely be freed, as no people, in principle, is excluded from being admitted to the hearth embodying America's founding principles. No one human being or group of human beings differs so much in nature from any other as to justify slavery. This is Lincoln's basic moral argument and it is laid out with stunning and rich detail by Jaffa. His paragraph-by-paragraph reading of Lincoln's First Inaugural, for example, stands as a classic of textual interpretation of the most meticulous kind.<p> The counter-argument to the premise of moral equality rested on several pillars beginning with a view of states' rights that separated states' rights from natural rights. This, in effect, denied ""any constitutional standing to the principles of the Declaration of Independence."" The popular sovereigntists (like Douglas) and separationists (like Calhoun) repudiated the Jeffersonian backdrop to Lincoln, and Jaffa covers this ground in detail. The upshot of his discussion of Jefferson is that no ""people is independent of the moral law,"" and that the source of all rights ""is nature."" Although Jefferson was not himself a Christian or a pious man, Jaffa is right to see how ""profoundly religious were the great political questions"" that dominated British constitutional combat before the American Revolution and that continue to reverberate in American political debate.<p> In a potent sense, the arguments for and against slavery were arguments about biblical interpretation and which texts-the curse of Canaan from the Old Testament or the radical arguments of Jesus of Nazareth-were to prevail. In extending natural rights to slaves and in linking this to biblical teaching, Lincoln wound up as the most powerful spokesmen for the theology that triumphed eventually-its most recent great spokesman being Martin Luther King Jr.-in America. Jaffa notes on page 49 that, for Lincoln, ""the natural rights doctrine of the Declaration"" is ""implicit in the rule"" laid down in the New Testament: ""Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do he even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets."" Natural rights is the way to speak politically and in the voice of a form of reason accessible to all whether they are Christians or not.<p> In unpacking Lincoln's great speeches and debate orations, Jaffa shows what an astute, formidable, and brilliant interlocutor Lincoln was. Lincoln's systematic deconstruction of Douglas's defense of ""popular sovereignty,"" including the claim that if people want a wrong they have a right to it and there is no way to gainsay that majoritarianism (or plebicitarianism), is a masterful bit of political philosophy and political rhetoric, with the rhetor cast in the position of a public educator. In fighting indefatigably against both the moral indifferentism of Douglas-people can have slavery or not as the case may be-and the positive good of slavery stance of Calhoun, Lincoln's task, according to Jaffa on page 74, lay in ""convincing his fellow countrymen that slavery was indeed a morally pathological condition."" Jaffa's tracing of the ways in which historic interpreters (from Carl Becker's classic work on the Declaration down to the present) have either tacitly or explicitly endorsed or lent credence to the Douglas stance or even, Jaffa argues, the Calhoun position, is complex and controversial. Jaffa is passionate in his defense of the natural rights position and eloquent in his display of Lincoln's extraordinary contributions to that position, on the level of thought and action. This book's section on what Lincoln learned from Shakespeare is alone worth the price of admission.<p> At times, however, Jaffa is so carried away by his subject matter and his passion for it that he makes hyperbolic claims. Here are a few examples: ""Never since Socrates has philosophy so certainly descended from heaven into the affairs of mortal men,"" this of course on Lincoln. On page 389, Lincoln is credited with being a master Euclidian who proceeded in argument in a way that gave it finality and a kind of mathematical certainty. At the same time, Lincoln is suffused on page 358 with powers amounting to divination for ""without public opinion polls, he knew far better than any present-day politician what the great mass of citizens thought and felt about unfolding events. And his actions were always timed to the beating of their hearts."" One wonders about this given strong anti-black sentiment in the North as well as the South. In response to some of Jaffa's more absolute claims, one could, for example, disagree with him that anything in politics is ever settled definitively, once and for all. No argument, however airtight, can do that. At the same time, there is no doubt whatsoever that on all known grounds of logic, rhetoric, and philosophy, Lincoln had the better case.<p> There are other moments when Jaffa doth protest too much by drawing direct parallels between 19th century arguments and events and the most hideous horrors of the 20th century, e.g., Confederate defender Alexander Stephens, in his two-volume masterpiece, A Constitutional View of the Late War Between the States (GAM Publications, ISBN 087377177X, $86.99 hardcover), published between 1868 and 1870, made a prophecy about the confederacy that, for Jaffa, ""resembles nothing so much as Hitler's prophecies of the thousand-year Reich."" Historian Carl Becker is chided for citing from a book written in 1875 by political philosopher Joseph DeMaistre, a French conservative thinker, and Jaffa comments acerbically on page 118 that ""Becker is quoting with approval a member of the same political sect that would say, in 1940, 'Better Hitler than Blum.'"" This sort of hyperbole is unnecessary. Jaffa needn't gild the lily: it detracts from the solid scholarly core of this complex, highly condensed work. <br><br> The moments of excess, fortunately, are few. What comes through so stunningly as the book's overriding thesis and motif is Lincoln's brilliance at demolishing the arguments that sustained slavery. One final example: slavery defenders and slaveholders routinely passed laws and made rules defining what slaves could or could not do and what punishments would be exacted should they transgress. But when a creature is recognized as capable of reflecting on a rule and either obeying it or not, you have unwittingly conceded the human status of that creature, a status that slavery denies. If a slave can have an opinion, you are crediting him with intentionality. This means he is human. If he can recognize obligations, he is human. How then can one consistently deny that humanness when it comes time to defend the pernicious institution of slavery itself?<br> <br>There is no better way to conclude this review than to express my agreement with Jaffa that doing justice to Abraham Lincoln requires understanding his profound defense of moral equality, even as one recognizes that the full political, legal, and social implications of that equality have required generations to tease out-and will no doubt take many generations more. Let us conclude with Lincoln's own words drawn from a fragment ""On Slavery"" dated October 1858, in which he derides the pro-slavery position: ""But slavery is good for some people!!! As a good thing, slavery is strikingly peculiar, in this, that it is the only good thing which no man ever seeks the good of, for himself. Nonsense! Wolves devouring lambs, not because it is good for their own greedy maws, but because it is good for the lambs!!!"" The American people were more than fortunate-they were blessed-that such a one as Lincoln was in their midst in such a terrible time. As Jaffa points out repeatedly, it all could have gone much differently. <br><br><i>Jean Bethke Elshtain is Laura Spelman Rockefeller Professor of Social and Political Ethics at the University of Chicago.

"He was a charismatic, natural born leader who graduated second in his class at West Point and achieved fame during this country's darkest moment. Why then is George B. McClellan so poorly regarded today? <p> McClellan certainly was an extremely well-educated, superbly trained, experienced officer, as author James M. Ridgway, Jr. stresses in <b>Little Mac: Demise of an American Hero</b>. Always adored by his troops, after the War he still remained popular enough to be decisively elected governor of New Jersey. Nonetheless, most historians have treated McClellan with sarcastic disdain; so much that, as Ridgway points out in his introduction, at the end of the 20th century McClellan is often defined by a few choice Lincoln phrases - ""he has the slows"" and ""he will not fight."" <p> What Ridgway offers in this revisionist study is a fresh landscape of facts from which the reader can draw his own interpretation of McClellan's worth as a military leader. Ridgway, a Civil War Round Table veteran, passionately challenges the Radical Republican view of the general popularized by such historians as Stephen W.

Stanton and the post-assassination ascension of  Lincoln as a political icon, coupled with McClellan's refusal to play the political game, conspired to discredit McClellan. <p> An undeniably clever strategist, McClellan believed that the easiest way to Richmond was from the east. However, this approach seemingly required taking his army out of a position to protect Washington, causing many senior Union officials, including Stanton, to wonder if McClellan meant to give the Rebels the capital. In fact, as Ridgway correctly points out, McClellan was in no position to act boldly for many reasons. For instance, his primary Confederate nemesis, Robert E. Lee (Joseph E. Johnston before Seven Pines), benefited from access to northern newspapers in which McClellan's movements and intentions were assailed by the general's opponents. More generally, Ridgway convincingly argues that had McClellan received the necessary backing from the Republican radicals that Lee enjoyed with his government, he could have decisively defeated the Confederates and taken Richmond. But this did not occur. <p> Despite McClellan's popularity with his soldiers, a series of blunders (culminating in his failure to prevent the Confederate escape after Antietam) earned him a reputation for being timid and slow. He lost favor with the person whose support most mattered when Lincoln removed him permanently from command after Sharpsburg. <p>  But Ridgway assigns principal responsibility to the Republican propaganda machine of the 1860s for the erosion of McClellan's reputation. Only a handful of books have bucked the massive anti-McClellan tide to tell the general's side of the story. McClellan wrote  an account to clear his name, but it was fatefully lost in an 1881 fire, and then any further attempt was thwarted by his unexpected death in 1885. While General George McClellan's reputation stands the scrutiny of time, Ridgway's <b>Little Mac: Demise of an American Hero</b> provides a provocative glimpse of the general and his worth as a military leader. <p> <i>Major Dominic J.

2231	195084497		Runaway Slaves: Rebels on the Plantation	Runaway Slaves: Rebels on the Plantation	Franklin, John Hope	Schweninger, Loren		"Henry David Thoreau said that historians show us the present more than the past, and nothing illustrates his statement better than <b>Runaway Slaves: Rebels on the Plantation</b> by John Hope Franklin and Loren Schweninger. The book's thesis is that ""violence and cruelty . . . were inherent in the slave system,"" and that slaves did not want to be slaves. This thesis should be a no-brainer, but according to Franklin and Schweninger, ""Many people still believe that slaves were generally content, that racial violence on the plantation was an aberration. . . . "" <p><b>Runaway Slaves</b> begins with an overview of slave activity which the authors call ""resistance."" This includes ""sabotage"" of various kinds: pulling down fences, damaging wagons and other equipment, ruining clothing, and other vandalism such as that old favorite, swinging pigs. Slaves also stole ""nearly anything that was not under lock and key."" (It should be noted here that such behavior could as easily be interpreted by slaveholders as evincing criminality or moral deficiency in the transplanted Africans.) <p>Further, slaves sometimes worked slowly or sloppily, damaged crops while harvesting, stopped working, feigned illness, slipped away for a day, got drunk. (Again, such activity could be compared to similar behavior among slave labor in Nazi factories, or it could fuel racial stereotypes.) Sometimes open defiance was the result of a system which ""by its very nature created a milieu for interracial conflict."" Slaves would refuse orders, threaten overseers and masters, and inflict violence upon whites. <p>Such ""resistance"" was characterized by one overseer in terms which not only suggest origins for racial stereotyping but illustrate the nonsense of American slavery: ""They would not work at all, he believed, if it were not for the whipping they would receive if they refused."" Imagine that! Involuntary labor did not work voluntarily!<p>It is no surprise, then, that planters are also quoted as registering dismay over the <i>ungratefulness</i> of slaves. George Washington himself wrote that a girl who ran away from Mount Vernon had been ""brought up and treated more like a child than a Servant."" But of course, she was a ""servant"" -- a genteel word for ""slave."" People who failed to be grateful for their position as slaves sometimes ran away, and this phenomenon provides the main concern of Franklin and Schweninger's book.<p><b>Opportunity crucial to escapes</b><p>Slaves ran for a number of reasons. A master's death might change their situation: they might now be treated worse or sold. Slaves ran to escape the brutality of masters and overseers. They fled to avoid unwanted sexual advances -- some of which entailed the additional unpleasantness of bringing the ire of the plantation mistress down on the hapless black female. But the fact that ""opportunity"" was a crucial factor in escapes reminds us that slavery itself, not particular complaints or abuses, caused slaves to run. One cannot speak of ""abuses"" in a system which was itself fundamentally abuse.<p>In the course of the book, one learns a great deal about the ""peculiar institution."" Tens of thousands of slaves, for example, worked not on their farms and plantations, but were hired out -- rented out like machinery to factory owners or to anyone who wanted work done. It would be like walking into a Just Ask Rental and finding along one wall a row of naked people holding up their resumes, hourly charges posted above their heads. No wonder Northerners perceived the slave system's threat to free labor as being comprehensive.<p>But what really spoke to Northerners of the Victorian era was the cruel fact of family separation, as brought to light by Harriet Beecher Stowe. Franklin and Schweninger present numerous brief accounts of families being separated. A leading reason for running away was to get back to a family, a husband, a wife, even if only for a short time. (The authors show that most runaways were only temporarily, if at all, successful.) <p>Two examples: ""Shortly after being sold, the South Carolina slave Sally . . . headed straight to Parker's Ferry and the plantation where her husband lived. Another slave, Nelly, owned by Isham Lowery, the captain of a coastal sloop running from Ashepoo to Charleston, left her master's plantation near Porotaligo and went straight to her husband, who concealed her for more than six months.""<p><b>Runaway Slaves</b> is filled with such cases. This method is both a strength and a weakness. Numerous vignettes humanize information by fixing names and personalities to it. On the other hand, such evidence can be called merely ""anecdotal""; perhaps worse, the book causes frustration in that stories are constantly begun but seldom finished. But many quotations are singularly effective; e.g., Fanny Kemble descrying the ""inhumanity of allowing a man to strip and lash a woman, the mother of ten children; to extract from her, toil."" <p>Imagine if that were done to a mother today, instead of, say, hiring her as an adjunct university professor at below subsistence wages, with no benefits and no possibility of full-time employment: the result would be outrage. The point is not whether slaveholders did regularly strip and lash mothers, but that the system sanctioned the possibility.<p>How many slaves ran off? Two tables show numbers of runaways from Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, South Carolina, and Louisiana in the years 1790-1816 and 1838-1860. These five states generated 2,011 documented runaways in the years cited. The reader must ask whether these figures support ""tens of thousands"" of runaways to Southern cities; moreover, do they bear out the book's further claim that runaways constituted a clear protest and a significant problem for the slave system?<p>The authors' claim suggests a ""how many"" question, yet the evidence does not yield quantifiable results. It was ""unusual"" for masters to keep records of runaways. Further, writings circulated in the South omitted mention of runaway problems because owners were reluctant to admit that they experienced failures in ""managing their property."" Hence ""the exact number of runaways will never be known. . . . "" <p>Does this lack of evidence mean that Southerners were afraid and ashamed, or that only a predictable number of malcontents absconded? The first possibility makes sense but is an argument from silence.<p>Therefore Franklin and Schweninger produce other evidence; much of it, though not quantifiable, is documentary. Advertisements and offers of rewards are gleaned from newspapers and handbills. Letters enumerate slave escapes; planters kept records of where their slaves' families lived for the obvious purpose of indicating where pursuers might look for absconders; expenses of those pursuers were detailed in planters' account books. Southerners bred, trained, and advertised ""negro dogs"" for chasing runaways. State governments spent a great deal of time and paper in writing fugitive laws. Men made livings as slave catchers. Jail records show captured slaves being held until claimed or sold. Petitions to legislatures and county courts dealt with runaways.<p><i>How many</i>, then, do these sources suggest? Reading page after page of brief anecdotes, the reader begins to think that every black man and woman in the South, together with all their relations, was on the move trying to evade the benefits of Southern civilization. Therefore the ""conservative"" estimate of 4% on page 281 comes as a surprise. To decide whether such a figure clinches the argument, we need other numbers for comparison, such as what percentage of enlistees deserts from the U.S. armed forces.<p>In any case, the book does a good job of avoiding heavy irony and shrillness. An excellent example is the quotation, without comment, of a joint statement issued by slaveholders on why hired-out slaves in Richmond ran away: they were influenced by ""Foreigners and poor and ignorant persons, who have no other idea of right and wrong than that which conforms exactly to their interest."" Those Southerners thought that up all by themselves; it was not put into their mouths by Mark Twain.<p>Ultimately, the question of slavery does not rest on numbers. Either one child sold away from his mother is enough, or it is not. Either one drop of blood drawn by the lash requires one drawn by the sword, or it does not. <p><b>Runaway Slaves</b> is a formidable corrective. But whatever the book tells us about slavery, its being written today tells us more than we want to know about ourselves. We have wished to believe that Lincoln was wrong when he said that the war had been caused by slavery and represented divine retribution on both South and North for a moral outrage. Slavery was evil; it was heartless and brutal, and slaves did not want to be slaves. Too bad we need to be told this again.<p><i>Kent Gramm is author of </i>Gettysburg: A Meditation on War and Values,<i> and contributor to </i>The Gettysburg Nobody Knows<i> and </i>Giants in Their Tall Black Hats: Essays on the Iron Brigade."

1350	037540158X	$30.00	Lincoln's Virtues		Miller, William Lee			"How was it that a man born to the most grueling poverty on the remote western prairie, lacking in formal education--merely the son of ""a wandering laboring boy,"" in his own words, and early in life, little better himself--rose from obscurity to the American presidency, and from there to immortality? The mystery of Abraham Lincoln's astonishing ascent has captivated hundreds of biographers, and millions of readers, and yet has stubbornly eluded definitive explanation. <p>Now comes William Lee Miller's ""ethical biography,"" offering as engrossing and intriguing an explanation for Lincoln's emergence as I have read in years, in a book full of wisdom, insight, and charm. Lincoln was ""not born, after all, on Mount Rushmore,"" the author declares, even though he makes absolutely clear that he believes he belongs there. <p>Then how to explain his success? Miller insists that Lincoln triumphed not only because he was ""able"" or ""affable,"" although he was certainly both, nor because he had the good fortune to be born white and male, rather than black and female, which severely limited opportunity in 19th-century America, nor because he was lucky enough to grow up here, not in Africa or South America. Nor can we attribute his success to a loving stepmother who encouraged him, or an unquenchable thirst for reading: the Bible, Shakespeare, Euclid, the law, and of course, newspapers. Other children in other villages had similar upbringings and similar ambitions. <p>To Miller, ""an ethical biography presupposes the freedom of the subject, within some limits, to choose different courses of action. It assumes that he can, by a sequence of choices, shape abiding patterns of conduct--virtues."" <p>And these, Miller points out, Lincoln chose in abundance. For example, in a frontier milieu in which animal rights activism was unimaginable, Lincoln disliked hunting, made it a point to stop killing animals as soon as he could, and even as a youth rebuked his cruel friends when they placed hot coals on turtles' shells for sport. And yet he became popular among his peers. <p>Most of those peers drank, swore, smoked, whored, went regularly to church, and resigned themselves to working their unyielding land forever. Lincoln eschewed liquor, watched his language (except when relating ribald stories), disliked tobacco, respected (and usually struck out with) girls, never joined a church, and hated farm work with a passion. ""This man,"" Miller reminds us, ""was, not, spiritually speaking, a rail-splitter."" Rather, he was an irresistible original, blessed with extraordinary gifts, enormously appealing despite his gauche homeliness, but just as important, grounded by solid moral purpose. <p>In a deeply racist society, Lincoln was early and routinely ""cordial"" to the few blacks he knew. He was neither a Nativist nor an Indian-hater--also rare. Although stronger than most contemporaries, he was never a bully. While most of his class, not to mention most of his own family, became Jacksonian Democrats, he became a Whig. He dreamed not of the agrarian ideal, but of internal improvements and opportunity in the city. <p>Miller's anomalous Lincoln is simply not like most men of his time and environment. He was not a backwoodsman who wanted to stay in the backwoods, a raftsman who fell in love with the river, a farmer who wanted to stay on the farm, a penniless boy who expected to stay penniless, and certainly not an uneducated boy who expected to stay uneducated. He was not a small town lad who loved the small town and wanted to stay there. . . ."" Neither nature nor nurture could fully explain him. <p>What he was, argues the author, was a relentlessly diligent man of extraordinary ""moral self-confidence."" He developed a compelling ethical rationale for his politics and his life, and, even though he matured greatly as a thinker, writer, and leader, never wavered from his own first principles. Notwithstanding recent arguments to the contrary by revisionists like Lerone Bennett Jr., Miller convincingly points out that though he was a viable mainstream politician in what was arguably the most racially retrograde of any northern state, Lincoln insisted bravely, early, and consistently that slavery was a moral evil, and that blacks were human beings who had a natural right to eat the bread they earned with their own hands. This alone set him apart. <p>Miller readily concedes that Lincoln was also a pragmatist. He did abandon his ""beau ideal,"" Henry Clay, in 1848, to support Zachary Taylor for the Whig presidential nomination because he thought only Taylor could win the general election. He was also resigned to taking small political steps in pursuit of large moral goals. Miller's Lincoln was decidedly not an unattached moral philosopher, examining with Olympian objectivity the great question of principles versus consequences in making moral choices."" Rather, he was ""a thoroughly engaged"" professional who dedicated himself especially after the 1854 Kansas-Nebraska act ""aroused"" him back into public life--to fighting the spread of slavery even if he could only do so, to paraphrase his own description of his education, ""by littles."" <p>Miller's Lincoln adroitly combined ""moral clarity"" and the ""'responsibility' of a worthy politician."" He was ""in an admirable way, a combination of the prophet with the 'prudence,'"" an exemplar of morality without moralism. He functioned not ""simply as a coalition-building political manager,"" but as one who simultaneously kept ""the central moral principle clear. . . ."" <p>So Miller frames his penetrating analysis of Lincoln's private and public life from the backwoods of Kentucky to the presidency. The emphasis is on Lincoln's earlier years, and Miller revisits and reanalyzes them with a bravura mastery of the sources and a beguiling writing style. In early chapters, it radiates down-home folksiness, occasionally speaking directly to the reader with personal asides like ""that is the way it always is, is it not?"" and ""if you think about it."" His Lincoln is a ""tip-top"" orator who might be inspiring one day, ""goofy"" the next. On one occasion, Miller dismisses a particularly irksome preconception by declaring: ""Ha!"" In less capable hands, such archaic constructions would seem ludicrous. Somehow, Miller carries it off. His style suits the man he describes: it is rigorously serious at the same time it is slyly humorous. <p>Besides, as Lincoln's public utterances grow more profound, so cleverly does the density of the author's prose. Miller's analyses of Lincoln's Lyceum Speech (surely Miller is the first ever to compare it to the Billie Holiday song, ""Strange Fruit!""), his Peoria Speech, his debates with Douglas, and his other pre-presidential masterpieces, prove original and riveting. <p>Miller concludes by suggesting that Lincoln won the White House thanks to a torrent of confluent breaks: ""geography, skill, luck, and acceptable ideological placement."" But he hastens to add that these alone do ""not reflect anything extraordinary about the candidate."" What set Lincoln apart was ""the quality of his public argument."" Here, Miller argues, ""was the essential ingredient in Lincoln's rise."" <p>Miller has provided new readers and old Lincoln hands alike with a fresh and inspiriting new portrait, not to mention a daring challenge to the leaders and voters of modern America. Behold this man Lincoln. Appreciate him without cynicism. Emulate him. And duplicate him if you can. <p>In the end, perhaps the only thing wrong with this book is that it ends. If ever a volume cried out for a sequel, this one does. The Civil War years await Miller's analysis. If he resists, he will disappoint as many readers as he will delight with this triumph. <p><i>Harold Holzer has authored, co-authored, and edited 20 books on Lincoln and the Civil War.

1543	805059725		The Year of Jubilo: A Novel of the Civil War		Bahr, Howard			"Howard Bahr is already well-known to readers as the author of the acclaimed novel <i>The Black Flower</i>, a powerful and elegantly written book that captured the essential detail and wrenching violence of men in battle as have few other works of fiction about the Civil War or any other war. Now he has returned with another performance of equal skill and astonishing complexity. <p> Despite its subtitle, ""A Novel of the Civil War,"" <b>The Year of Jubilo</b> is not so much about the conflict itself as the aftermath of the War, that period between surrender and the full onset of Reconstruction, when anger was still hot on both sides, as they sought to find a balance between the strong hold of the past and the uncertainties of the future. Confederate soldiers were returning home to find their homes destroyed or their families dispersed, Federal troops billeted to maintain civil order and peace, and occasional forays by remnants of local irregulars intent on fanning the flames of war again. <p> Set in the spring of 1865, <b>The Year of Jubilo</b> tells the story of Gawain Harper's return to Cumberland, Mississippi. He had enlisted in the Confederate army three years earlier because the father of his intended, Morgan Rhea, told Gawain that he could court her only if he did his manly duty by defending the sacred cause. A professor of English literature by trade and a freethinker by disposition, Gawain has little interest in politics or defending any cause beyond the traditional values of a civilized society. <p> Like his Arthurian namesake, however, Gawain accepts the challenge to win his lady love, but finds there are even more obstacles to overcome after the scaly dragon of war has been slain. Morgan's sister and her husband have been murdered by a renegade leader of Southern irregulars, King Solomon Gault, who cares less about the principles of secession than about self-aggrandizement and establishing his own brand of brutal community justice after chasing out the Yankees. Morgan's father now requires that Gawain avenge their deaths by killing Gault. <p> <b>Characters that irresistibly engage the reader</b> <p> Such a bare-bones description hardly does justice to Bahr's narrative, which is complex, full of unexpected turns and revelations, and introduces a stage full of characters that wander in and out of the story in patterns governed both by Providence and circumstantial chance. Indeed, whenever Bahr's characters enter the narrative, they seem to arrive as fully embodied individuals rich in background experience and invested with a depth of personality that irresistibly engages the reader. They are people we would like to have known, and we regret when they leave the narrative to follow their own destinies in this world or beyond, even those killed in shameless acts of murder and perfidy. <p> The villain, Gault, for example, is someone the reader loves to hate. He is a thoughtful, introspective man who might have done considerable good for society were his thought processes not so hopelessly deranged. He hates slavery, not because of any sympathy for blacks, whom he considers to be brute beasts, but because he thinks it degrades the white slave owners. In fact, he had rid his own plantation of slaves and set up a primitive form of share cropping. Gault also has a sense of history and a literary turn of mind. He is writing his memoirs even as he enacts his evil deeds, often suiting the action to what will make good reading. In this instance, art shapes life in a direct way. <p> Wherever one looks, there is writing of extraordinary power and accomplishment. The prologue is a tour de force, relating the events of the murder and lynching of Morgan's sister and husband, but told from the point of view of their young son, who is blind. The text is rich in the sensory detail of touch and sound as it would be expressed by a boy without sight. Not once does Bahr slip and allow his omniscience to move beyond what the character can know and feel as we experience the inner life and imagination of the boy. <p> This is not the only passage that is fully saturated with intimate details of sound, light, color, smells, flora, and fauna which go to make up nature. Fresh air, foul odors, and the sweat of human pain play on our senses. Bahr has as keen an eye and ear for man in his social and environmental state as any living writer and better than most long since dead. <p> ""Freedom"" is the key thematic word in the novel, repeated from time to time by one character or another, each with a different expectation or meaning. In general, it means the escape from the strictures of society and politics, the ability to come and go as one wishes, and the liberty to be someone important or of no consequence in accord with the dictates of one's heart. It is the freedom to belong to one's self and to escape the inevitable rush of history and circumstance. As one character puts it, reflecting on the times before the settlement of the wilderness, ""It was fun then and the closest I ever came to freedom. We made up the rules as we went along, and everybody thrived on possibility - what we could make of this place, what it might become - and God's will seemed to match our own so perfectly that we applauded Him for His good judgment."" Most of the principled characters seem to find their freedom in one way or another. <p> A native of Meridian, Mississippi, Howard Bahr knows his South and the facts of the Civil War as well as most scholars who spend a lifetime in research. As a young man, he worked on the Illinois Central Railroad in Gulfport, Mississippi, during which time he began to read William Faulkner and Southern literature. From 1982 to 1993 he communed with the spirit of the master as curator of Faulkner's home and museum in Oxford, Mississippi, and since 1993 he has been a professor of English at Motlow State Community College in Tullahoma, Tennessee. His work-in-progress deals with Southern life in the 1930s for a brakeman on the Southern Railway between New Orleans and Meridian. Wherever he sets his future fiction, it seems likely that Howard Bahr will prove to be a major presence in American literature. <p> <i>M.

1522	345427505		Gone for Soldiers: A Novel of the Mexican War		Shaara, Jeff			"I don't believe any writer could create a fictional war better than the truth of the Civil War. The characters and settings, seething passions and inhuman horrors, dramatic twists and turns, a whopper climax at Gettysburg, and the tragic, inevitable road to the sequel-begging ending at Appomattox -- only Homer got close, and <i>that</i> was a real war, too. Maybe that's why fiction writers have produced at best only a handful of works that fully express the War, that marry the artistic requisites of timeless truth and beauty with the temporal realities of history. The finest literature about that period comes from those who were there and the historians who have tried to pull apart the threads of time and weave them back together so that we can try to understand. Next to the battlefields of Antietam and the Wilderness, fiction seems a sorry imitation of the truth.<p>Jeff Shaara stands among the most noble of those of us who try to wrap our pens and minds around the enormity of the Civil War, and he is one of the few to come close to succeeding. Constantly finding nobility in those he writes about, Shaara takes us into the heart of the myth, lets us live on Olympus for a while with the generals, and does not try to compete with history. Creating heroes is very much his business, and to that extent he is a mythmaker, a writer of epics that have the greater glory of their subjects as their goal.<p>Shaara's approach has not changed in <b>Gone for Soldiers</b>, nor have many of his subjects, but he has moved his setting from the green hills of wartime Virginia to the lava fields of Central Mexico during the Mexican-American War. Shaara picks up the story after General Zachary Taylor has lost steam following the victory over Santa Anna at Buena Vista. General Winfield Scott, that cantankerous and controversial veteran of the War of 1812, leads a new invasion on the eastern coast of Mexico at Vera Cruz, aided to no small degree by the canny advance work and wise counsel of engineer Captain Robert E. Lee. <p>As Scott pushes towards Mexico City, it is hard to say who is his greatest adversary -- Mexican dictator Santa Anna; President Polk, who is giving Scott only enough rope to hang any political intentions the general may have; or his staff of officers, men whose ambitions are matched only by their ineptitude. Despite the scorpions and the second-guessing of his generals, Scott and his army forge on through the battles of Cerro Gordo, Padierna, Churubusco, and Chapultepec to the taking of Mexico City. Mercifully, Shaara spares us the subsequent protracted negotiations and occupation that followed. <p>The shift in scenery helps and hurts. While most readers (one imagines) knew the outcome of the battles in <i>Gods and Generals</i> and <i>Last Full Measure</i>, relying on Shaara's considerable talents to make that knowledge seem like something they'd just learned in those pages, few Americans can honestly claim that they can name the major battles of the Mexican-American War, let alone who won them. For once, though, ignorance is a virtue; with relatively unknown material at his disposal, Shaara briskly drives the U.S. forces to Mexico City, building suspense at each battle, all towards the climactic storming of the gates of the capital. Given his ability to make the familiar fresh in his first two books, Shaara expertly immerses us in the details and surroundings of this less-studied time and place, and draws compelling scenes of battle that send the heart racing. The thrilling scouting journeys of Lee that he relates will surely enter the canon of Lee lore.<p>The problem is that the Mexican-American War lacks the inherent drama of the Civil War, that bigger-than-fiction quality that keeps the fires burning North and South. Shaara chooses to play down the Mexican War's place in the increasing sectional conflict growing at this time, and the<p>cautionary comparisons Shaara and others have made between the messy political nature of the Mexican War and Vietnam feel strained. Westmoreland was no Scott; Henry Kissinger bore little resemblance to diplomat Nicholas Trist; and as unpopular and political as the Mexican War may have been, Scott did walk into the central plaza of Mexico City and salute the U.S. flag after a series of difficult, but fairly decisive victories. Even deeper, all wars are to a greater or lesser extent messy and political. <p>As usual, Shaara presents the action through the eyes of various luminaries: here usually either Lee or Scott, two honorable men bonded by their loyalty to nation and their common sense. Yet for all the hand wringing of his characters, we never hear the grumbling in the front lines, only the politics and the generals. The human cost is less fully felt. In the Civil War books, the gilded portraits of the heroic generals stood in relief to the everyday soldiers that we already had a sense of, in a conflict that we knew. Shaara was filling in a gap, adding a melody. Here, limited as many readers will be by their ignorance of the conflict and the portions of it that Lee and Scott (and hence we) see, Shaara can't rely on our own knowledge of the war to provide the other, unspoken strains, the tragic chords of the common man that we play to ourselves while reading <i>Gods and Generals</i> and <i>The Last Full Measure</i>. As he has Scott himself say at a press conference after the war is won, ""Generals aren't heroes. The heroes are still out there, patrolling the streets, walking their posts, or buried in that ground. That's my challenge to you. Write about that. And leave the politics and the damned generals out of it."" Yet Jeff Shaara's best writing is about a general; the general, to some. In Lee he finds his ultimate hero, and this devotion is what shines most brightly in this and his other books. At times it seems that Lee is the real point of all three, and in fact I'd have been happy if all of <b>Gone for Soldiers</b> had been from Captain Lee's eyes, for it's in Lee that Shaara truly opens himself to the complexities of human nature. <p>While his short portraits of Santa Anna, Nicholas Trist, and other secondary characters can drift towards stock, Shaara lets Lee wander through all the chambers of his heart and mind, revealing a man by turns brilliant, courageous, priggish, generous, nave, fearful, honorable, judgmental, and maybe even noble to a fault, like that other great losing general, Hector, who chose loyalty over cause. Shaara's Lee is, in the end, his greatest creation, maybe more so than any single title. By giving voice to this profound and retiring titan of American history, Jeff Shaara accomplishes his stated goal of offering a gift to the Confederate general. As Sandburg once did for Lincoln, Shaara has humanized the mythos of Lee as no one ever has and, in doing, makes an enduring contribution to literature.<p><i>Thomas Dyja is author of</i> Play for a Kingdom."

2049	195055446		The Rise and Fall of the American Whig Party: Jacksonian Politics and the Onset of the Civil War	Rise and Fall of the American Whig Party: Jacksonian Politics and the Onset of the Civil War The	Holt, Michael F.			"If collapse of the Whig party caused the Civil War, were Whigs themselves to blame? Michl Holt, Langbourne M. Williams Professor of American History and chairman of the history department at the University of Virginia, has written a monumental and superb study. The tome is richly detailed and written in lucid prose, supplemented by tables showing key vote returns. Holt's chronological narrative consists of some 1,000 pages, plus another 250 or so containing source notes and bibliography. The result of 20 years' work, <b>The Rise and Fall of the American Whig Party</b> is by far the most comprehensive account of the Whig party ever written and is perhaps the single most essential reference today for research into American antebellum politics.<p>The dialectical relationship between American political parties was arguably never so important to any political party as it was to Whigs during the second party system, circa 1834-54. Indeed, a central argument that runs through Holt's book is that Democrats profoundly influenced the fortunes of the Whig party. The Whig party took root when it carved out distinctive positions vis-a-vis the Democrats and later foundered when substantive differences -- real and perceived -- diminished after 1848. Whigs' common determination to oppose the Democrats (to defeat them in elections and to oppose their governance) held them together. Hence conflict with the Democrats was the chief centripetal force against which manifold centrifugal forces were arrayed: personal ambitions, fierce factional rivalries, and struggles over patronage.<p>Ideas have consequences<p>Tension was always there. Without balance applied by strong negative reference to Democrats, the Whig party would (and ultimately did) pull apart. Moreover, Whig and non-Whig leaders -- not voters or ""society"" or other impersonal forces -- made critical decisions that proved catastrophic, notwithstanding the strained, dynamic political environment born of sectional controversy. Whigs conceivably suffered from a problem endemic to conservative parties. They wind up holding the caboose, trying to slow down the train, as liberal parties take the initiative. In point of fact, Whigs had a well-defined conservative program, as well as articulate spokesmen to plead their case, including Henry Clay of Kentucky and Daniel Webster of Massachusetts.<p>The ideational basis for Whiggery was a nationalistic Jeffersonian economic agenda, codified into the so-called American System: high protective tariffs to nourish domestic manufacturing; a national bank to promote credit and sound currency; and internal improvements launched and financed by the federal government to improve infrastructure and to enhance the movement of people and goods. Whigs also railed against executive tyranny and preferred leadership by congressional consensus or compromise to that of chief executives and direct populist appeal. Whigs prided themselves on being constitutional unionists in the Madisonian tradition, who sought to preserve the Revolutionary generation's experiment in republican self-government through clean, honest (albeit activist) government and non-interventionist foreign policy.<p>Holt acknowledges the distinctive ideology of the Whig party but does not emphasize it overall. Whereas the Whigs viewed their ideology as timeless and permanent, however, Holt's central argument maintains that Whigs adapted ideology readily to changing times, in order to survive by striking a counterpoise to Democrats.<p>Party politics along a parabola<p>The Panic of 1837 and its aftermath and the annexation of Texas and subsequent war with Mexico (1846-48) -- gave salience to the Whigs' ideology and economic program. The prosperity after 1848 based on California gold strikes and foreign investment changed that appeal; moreover, land acquired from Mexico engendered domestic political conflict over the extension of slavery, the Compromise of 1850 notwithstanding. Mass immigration posed another challenge by the 1850sto Whigs in particular, since immigrants usually supported Democrats. Hypothesized Slave Power and Papal conspiracies mobilized huge and sometimes overlapping constituencies which threatened to rend or displace established political parties.<p>In the presidential race of 1844, Whigs were never more unified, and differences with Democrats were never sharper. Holt considers that year to have been a relative apogee for the Whig party in terms of optimal measure between cohesive and divisive forces. Indeed, the parabolic path of the Whig party from 1834-54 (with fluctuations between) attests to cyclic political fortune. Reasons for the party's birth, heyday, and death actually inhere in the same dynamics. The difference between 1834 and 1854, however, prevents the Whig phoenix from rising after 1854. To wit, the Know Nothing and Republican parties were positioned by then to siphon voters, and the new parties found compelling ways to usurp the Whig party's original ideological mission of saving republican liberty.<p>Practical success of the Whig party, as well as the legitimacy of policies based on any real consensus or compromise, depended on statehouses and state legislatures, in addition to Congress, administrations, and relations between national and state level parties and governments. These aspects interest Holt far more than ideology per se. Since state elections ran throughout the year almost every year, instead of in November of even-numbered years as they do today, Whig leaders read election results like polls to help them gauge public opinion and assess their political capital. They did not always do it very well.<p>Whigs certainly made their share of mistakes, which encouraged the dissolution of the Whig party. Desiring to ride new coalitions to victory in later elections, Whig presidents and vice presidents made wanton overtures to factions. Tyler courted Democrats and Southerners to sideline Clay. Taylor squandered significant opportunity by attempting to build an ill-conceived Taylor Republican vehicle. Fillmore obsessed over New York rival William H. Seward, but he was also jealous of fellow conservative Webster. Fillmore also misread political events and failed to move Whigs into a viable, bisectional Union party after Winfield Scott bungled his campaign in 1852. Then again, subsequent events hampered Whig recovery from that election debacle.<p>And there's the rub. Democrats made decisions too, and their decisions made effective counterpoise difficult. Democrats may have been better politicians. They certainly seemed to outflank Whigs on issues most of the time. Democrats also ran effective political machines, especially in immigrant communities. <p>There was one Democratic miscalculation, however, that made counterpoise next to impossible for the Whig party. Stephen Douglas introduced the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854. Its passage ""repealed"" the Missouri Compromise and opened land to slavery that had been set aside for free soil. The resulting row led to ""Bleeding Kansas"" and ""Bleeding Sumner"" (and splintered the Know Nothing party). Had Southern Whigs resisted the temptation to support the Nebraska Act, the Whig party might still have been saved and sectional realignment forestalled.<p>Like old soldiers, however, Whigs seemed to ""just fade away"" after 1852. Notwithstanding the death throes of state parties and delusional schemes by a few leaders, Whigs lacked the necessary temperament for a ""Come-Back Kid"" scenario. In many ways, the classic Whig temperament was averse to hurly-burly politics and to grassroots enthusiasms. In terms of political adroitness, moreover, Holt says Whigs lacked hard-headed realism and were frequently inept or inflexible -- never able to seize decisive moments. Whigs were temperamentally overcautious, slow to respond, and disdainful. Such habits of mind applied to wealthier Whigs with a privileged social background. Less intuitively, they also applied to self-consciously sober, church-going, middle-class folk, who formed the party's base. This temperament may have made Whig constituencies more vulnerable than Democratic constituencies to incursions by competing parties, whose members had few reservations.<p><i>Wesley Allen Riddle is fellow at the National Humanities Institute and author of recent essays on the Whig party in </i>Humanitas."

1609	1572491876		Retreat from Gettysburg		Ernst, Kathleen			"If MacKinlay Kantor ever thought about writing a sequel to his famous juvenile work <i>Gettysburg</i>, he might have chosen to write about the poignant ten days following that battle, when Robert E. Lee's retreating army crossed the flooded Potomac River. Fortunately, the vivid word-pictures and splendid writing Kathleen Ernst uses to bring those days to life in her new historical novel are worthy of Kantor himself. <p> Ernst is the author of two previous bestselling children's novels: <i>The Night Riders of Harper's Ferry </i> and <i>The Bravest Girl in Sharpsburg</i>. Now, in <b>Retreat from Gettysburg</b>, she delivers a wonderful tale of the Confederate army's desperate struggle to move its 17-mile-long wagon train of wounded soldiers from Williamsport, Maryland, back to the safety of southern ground. However, it is more than just a history lesson; it is the moving story of a young boy's struggle with the loss of his father and three brothers (all Union soldiers killed in previous battles) and with the numbing grief and war-weary living conditions that alter the relationship between him and his mother. <p> Chigger O'Malley is a 14-year-old youngster who tries his best to bring his mother back into his life after the loss of their family. Kids aged 10-14 will identify with many of the problems that Chigger, like any boy of his age, encounters. But the worry of being left as the only man of the house (especially when his mother still thinks of him as her little boy), the constant parade of soldiers invading their Maryland home, a wounded Rebel officer left in their care, and Chigger wishing he could join the Irish Brigade, especially will keep modern youngsters intrigued. <p> There are several characters who come and go in the story, but the author lets Chigger take center stage in passages where he struggles with his feelings. Should he kill the wounded Rebel who sleeps in his house? Should he run off and join the Irish Brigade to take the place of his slain brothers and father? Chigger is also torn between love for his grieving mother and the urge to leave her and join the army. <p> The sections where Chigger wrestles with these concerns and about what to do with the Rebel in his house are excellent: ""I stared at him, my head pounding. Images flashed through my mind like some crazy magic-lantern picture show. My own pa marching away. Ma in a weeping heap in her muddy mourning dress . . . the tug-of-war that had been raging inside for so long threatening to break me into little pieces. . . ."" <p> Ernst gives the young boy many opportunities to break free from his doubts and fears, but he is constrained by devotion to his mother. He doesn't realize he is capable of showing kindness; he has seen too much cruelty around him. War is the ultimate unkindness of all, according to the boy. It is only when Chigger makes up his mind to help someone else that he finds his place in the world. Parents and teachers (and one hopes young readers) should appreciate the author's moral lesson in <b>Retreat from Gettysburg</b>: ""Sometimes the simplest act of kindness can mean the most.""  <p> I also enjoyed the photographs and maps of the actual locations mentioned in the story. Ernst has carefully placed many authentic illustrations throughout the book to help students understand the setting and to follow the historical aspects of Chigger's home. I would love to see more authors use this layout in historical fiction written for upper elementary and middle school readers. Along with the photos, maps, and prints, Ernst includes an excellent section of ""Additional Resources"" that lists books, music, and information for planning a visit to areas mentioned in the novel. <p> Kathleen Ernst should be very proud of <b>Retreat from Gettysburg</b>. It is obvious she has spent many hours researching the details of the days following the battle. Teachers will find the book extremely useful for further study about the events, as well as a heart-warming, intense look at how youngsters and widows might have dealt with losing their fathers and husbands in the Civil War. <p> <i>Nancy Clayton, who lives in the Texas Hill Country, is the author of </i>Strange but True Civil War Stories<i> (1999) and </i>Draw History Civil War<i> (1999), both published for children by Lowell House Juvenile.

1888	803232128		Atlanta 1864: Last Chance for the Confederacy		McMurry, Richard M.			"In <b>Atlanta 1864</b>, Richard McMurry ably retraces the familiar scholarly analysis of Confederate command interplay during the Atlanta campaign, in which wartime field tent strategies collided with the long distance meddling of Richmond. Disappointingly, nothing fresh and new rises from McMurry's effort. <p> In the author's account of the depressing and petty quarrelling among Confederate generals and leaders during Atlanta's defense  - a saga that features Joseph E. Johnston, John Bell Hood, William J. Hardee, Braxton Bragg, and Jefferson Davis - Johnston takes the biggest ""hit."" He earns much of the criticism he gets, especially when his style of leadership is compared against the tactical daring of Lee in Virginia. McMurry does his usual scholarly work in this regard and his case is strong. <p> Where <b>Atlanta 1864</b> suffers most is McMurry's failure to appreciate how command decisions were influenced by topography, undergrowth, other natural landscape features (rivers and small streams), incomplete or incorrect information, and extremely poor roads along the 100-mile route of the Atlanta campaign. For example, much is made of the discovery of the undefended Snake Creek Gap and the opportunity it seemed to offer the Federals to trap the Confederate army in Dalton on May 9. <p> Instead, the author should have made more of the missed Federal opportunity at Resaca on May 14 and 15 - which represented a chance to annihilate the Confederate army, trapped as it was with rivers at its rear and flank. Snake Creek Gap was the <i>gate</i> to the annihilation of the Confederate army, but Resaca, eight miles east on the Western and Atlantic Railroad (and 13 miles south of Dalton), was the greater opportunity. And it was William Sherman, not James McPherson, who muddled this at Resaca. <p> Had George Thomas's and McPherson's armies, with their right flanks protected by the Oostenaula River, been ordered by Sherman to assault Leonidas Polk's and Hardee's fronts, the Confederates would almost have certainly been overwhelmed in position or destroyed in retreat crossing the rivers. Later in the campaign, Sherman repeated this tactical blunder when his reluctance to ""go for the jugular"" caused him to disregard Thomas's offer to use the Fourth and Fourteenth Corps of his Army of the Cumberland to assault and most probably destroy a majority of the rebel army at Jonesboro on September 1. <p> Disregard for critical topography and general conditions limiting troop movement again clouds the author's judgment when, on page 88, McMurry writes that Johnston could ""have hurried west from Allatoona and confronted Sherman while the Federals were on low ground along the left (south) bank of the Etowah River."" He adds that a United States army ""staff ride"" concluded a century and a half later that this would have been the best opportunity in the entire campaign for Johnston to have ""fought with advantage."" <p> The expertise of the army staff riders notwithstanding, given the condition of the existing roads in 1864 along the south bank of the Etowah River from Allatoona to Sherman's river crossing point near Kingston, a scheme to move an entire army and its equipment such distance in a timely manner would have been impossible. The only decent road west from Allatoona was the route Johnston actually used (the direct road from Acworth to Dallas), and it was along this road in the thickets and maze of ravines from Pickett's Mill through New Hope to Dallas that the next battles took place. <p> Overall, <b>Atlanta 1864: Last Chance for the Confederacy</b> is a well-written and well-researched study of the interplay of military/civilian bungling. Richard McMurry's analysis of command decisions in the field is less convincing. However, four chapters in the appendix are especially useful and concise: ""Chickamauga Fever and Grant's Grand Strategy for 1864""; ""Numbers and Losses""; ""Johnston's Railroad Strategy""; and ""The Atlanta Campaign and the Election of 1864."" <p> <i>Philip L.

Hoar brings welcome relief to anyone who ever has struggled to substantiate reports about a particular great-great relative who was thought to be a Civil War drummer boy or a certain local burial site that allegedly contains the remains of a Civil War hero. This work gives the reader 48 extensively researched profiles related to children -- some brothers -- who served under their respective flags during the War between the States. The inclusion of Susan Haines Clayton, who at the age of 10 was nursing wounded soldiers at Camp Carrington in Indianapolis, adds a special touch and meaning to the unique heroism of these young people.<p>Some names, such as Willie Johnston and John L. Clem, might be generally recognizable. But most are introduced to the reader for the first time. The profiles contain excellent family information, service chronologies when appropriate, and, for survivors of the battles and camp life, histories of their lives after the guns were silenced. Each personal story is enhanced, where possible, by the written words of veterans, comrades, family members, descendants, historians, or newspaper stories prepared in celebration of heroism or deeds remembered.<p>Readers will find further reward in appendices entitled: ""The Youngest to Serve,"" ""Soldierboy Casualties,"" and ""Youngest Who Earned the Congressional Medal of Honor.""<p>Hoar's presentation is a start. It is, hopefully, the first of many volumes specifically dedicated to this fascinating subject. I say this only because the author himself acknowledges that ""numbers of standouts among those who were exceptionally young Yanks and Rebs are absent from this review."" He follows that statement with a special call for assistance from readers. The generosity of this invitation promises future works complementary to the spirit and purpose of this volume.<p>The use of language is scholarly and, at times, intense. Reading requires full concentration. The reward is more than simple appreciation. We hear the drums and feel the human side of our Civil War from a very unique perspective. Patriotism is personified. Dedication and bravery are given special emphasis.<p>As the words are read it is sometimes difficult to keep in focus the tender age of these citizens. We empathize. We also think about today's children who live with civil war in many areas of the world. In like manner, we are amazed.<p><b>Callow Brave and True</b> is a story book and a reference book.

2256	226960889		Disarming the Nation: Women's Writing and the American Civil War	Disarming the Nation: Women's Writing and the American Civil War	Young, Elizabeth			"In <b>Disarming the Nation</b>, Elizabeth Young seeks to rectify the prevailing vision of the Civil War as a male exercise in nation build-ing and to discredit the prevailing view of the literature about it as a ""complemen-tary story of patrilineal self-generation.""  Deploring the ""myth of origins"" that casts Stephen Crane's <i>The Red Badge of Courage</i> as the emblematic white male novel of a white male war, Young insists upon the importance of white and African-American women's participation in the Civil War in both civilian and combat arenas. If Daniel Aaron and Edmund Wilson failed to find a great Civil War novel, it may have been because they were looking for it in the wrong places. Rather than puzzle about why ""canonical"" white male writers seemed unwilling or unable to capture the War in fiction, Young proposes that we turn our attention to the fictional and nonfictional writings of black and white women.<p>Young takes a somewhat conspiratorial view of men's Civil War writing, which she describes as a ""remasculinization"" of the War, one that purposefully ""displaces the female author and reader from their foundational positions with-in the making of Civil War fiction."" She finds gender implications in all of the various names that different groups applied to the War (War of Northern Aggression, War between the States, and so forth), but views the designation ""Civil War"" as especially rich in this regard.<p>Indeed the play upon the multiple meanings of ""civil"" and ""civility"" furnishes the main rationale for the book. For the war that interests Young has little or nothing to do with specific battles, combatants, or even outcomes. Her interests lie in the metaphoric possibilities of the relations between ""civil"" and gender. Civility, Young argues, represented both possibilities and constraints for white and black women, who were simultaneously its agents and its objects, but her emphasis ultimately falls upon the ways in which civility thwarted women's freedom. Thus, she insists that as civility intertwined with the ""interlocking grids of gender, race, and class,"" it ""profoundly circumscribed social and psychic possibilities for women in nineteenth-century America.""<p>Women writers, according to Young, have fully exploited the symbolic possibilities of the idea of a civil war, which they have used as a ""multivalent cultural symbol"" -- a ""metaphor to represent internal rebellions, conflicts, and fractures."" This perspective informs her own analysis of women's civil war writing, which, she believes, points to several conclusions: (1.) ""the centrality of gender to the construction, political and literary, of nationhood""; (2.) the need for a shift in ""the gender framework of the American literary canon""; (3.) that ""women's Civil War writing presents a valuable opportunity to theorize the conceptual interdependence of gender, race, sexuality, and region in a concrete historical frame""; (4.) that ""the axes of gender, race, and sexuality are divided not only in relation to each other, but also internally""; and, finally, that even as women's Civil War texts ""gloss fractures of national identity, so too do they bring into view some deep faultlines, social and psychic, in female subjectivity.""<p>Young does not claim to offer a comprehen-sive survey of women's writing about the Civil War or of the historical novel as a literary genre. Her interests lie in the play of memory and, especially, in metaphor, ""less as a specific 's-thetic form than as a connective mode of repre-sentation, which brings together spheres -- such as female psyche and male nation -- that might otherwise be culturally distinct.""<p>The language of civil war, she believes, permits writers to ""thematize new forms of individual and national identity,"" frequently by means of a rhetoric that emphasizes division and rebelliousness. In this respect, Young clearly proclaims her allegiance to feminist readings of women's experience, especially those that dwell upon women's transgressions of boundaries, covert rebellions, and internal conflicts. To illustrate this general interpretation of women's relation to the War, Young focuses upon a selection of women writers whose work manifests the themes that interest her: Harriet Beecher Stowe, Louisa May Alcott, Elizabeth Keckley, Loreta Janeta Velazquez, Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, and Margaret Mitchell.<p>Young's choices may strike some readers as idiosyncratic, not least because they exclude the many white Southern women writers who have directly and indirectly explored aspects of the War and its consequences. She nonetheless defends them for the evidence they offer of the ways in which women participated in the formulation of ""foundational fictions,"" ""invented traditions,"" ""imagined communities,"" and ""other modes of nation-building that might otherwise exclude or disempower them."" In these works, she suggests, ""the nation often becomes, symbolically speaking, feminized, transvestite, or protolesbian."" Throughout the book, Young seems to be arguing that women's fictional transgression of social, racial, and sexual boundaries must complicate and enrich our understanding of the nation that emerged from the War. There can be no doubt that one of her main goals in writing the book lies in her determination to support feminist and postmodernist arguments about the arbitrary character of all social, racial, and sexual boundaries. The subject of cross-dressing especially attracts Young because it seems to confirm the arbitrary and artificial character of sexual differentiation.<p>In discussing Loreta Velazquez's <i>The Woman in Battle</i>, the narrative of her experience as a Confederate soldier, Young explores the significance of cross-dressing as an attack upon the manhood of Confederate soldiers. She presents Velazquez's cross-dressing or ""passing"" as ""a strategic redefinition of femininity along with masculinity."" By passing as a man, Velazquez ""situates masculinity in the realm of performance."" Young emphasizes the pleasure that Velazquez takes in her ability, when in male disguise, to seduce women, but acknowledges that Velazquez's pleasure in these seductions ""corresponds to her antipathy toward any possible feminist body politic."" In other words, her ""most radical notions about gender and sexuality remain at the level of fantasy, divorced from the emerging social formations -- feminism and lesbianism -- to which their structures might seem to belong."" Velazquez apparently enjoys the challenge of seduction but has no sexual desire for her ""conquests."" This is not an attitude that endears her to Young, for whom Velazquez's narrative above all confirms ""the importance of metaphors in constructing bodies and the relations between them.""<p>In the chapter on Margaret Mitchell's <i>Gone With the Wind</i>, Young returns to these themes with a vengeance, emphasizing Mitchell's feminization of Ashley, masculinization of Scarlett, and blackening of Rhett. Young especially delights in the opportunity to uncover and highlight manifestations of sexual -- and racial -- transgression, thereby vicariously challenging conventional proprieties and boundaries.<p>She carries the focus on sexual and racial ambiguities into her ""Afterword"" in which she discusses contemporary Civil War reenactors and two contemporary writings, Rosellen Brown's novel, <i>Civil Wars</i>, and June Jordan's essay, ""Civil Wars."" Presenting Confederate reenactments as reactionary exercises in nostalgia, Young argues that ""the collective impact of an admiring reanimation of the Confederacy is the renewal of racism."" The shadow of the Confederacy looms over Brown's novel, which concludes with the female protagonist contemplating a new secession in the form of divorce from her husband. Jordan's ""Civil Wars,"" in contrast, deconstructs the notion of civility itself, presenting it as ""a dangerous fiction, which effaces emotion and polices politics."" From these diverse stories, Young draws the conclusion that today, as during the 19th century, ""women's civil wars' encompass multiple conflicts and point in contrary directions, both repressive and liberatory."" In these conflicts, women still figure as ""expatriates in the nation of the male war story,"" the outcome of which they nonetheless continue to shape, ""fighting in the many ongoing battles -- at once internecine and uncivil -- among warring factions.""<p>In the end, <b>Disarming the Nation</b> remains something of a puzzle.  The book's conclusion, with its emphasis upon continuing struggles, seems to belie the ""disarming"" of its title, and such ambiguities pervade the text as a whole. Most readers will presumably have difficulty with the notion of feminism (an ideology) and lesbianism (a sexual disposition or practice) as ""social formations,"" especially since Young does not explain her meaning in this regard.<p>The work as a whole eschews the political and socio-economic relations that we normally associate with social formations, just as it eschews the military campaigns and strategies that we normally associate with wars. Young does repeatedly insist that her primary interests lie in the metaphorical links between women's writing and historical experience, but she pays so little attention to historical experience of any kind, even that which directly affected women, that the substance and import of the metaphors remain elusive. It is difficult to shake the impression that <b>Disarming the Nation</b> is above all an exercise in self-reflexive word play -- an extended web of interlocking verbal free associations. The links among those associations may construct a dense tapestry of selected women's fictional responses to the interplay of the words ""civility"" and ""war"", but they do not obviously increase our understanding of the Civil War or its impact upon women's lives and thought.<p><i>Elizabeth Fox-Genovese teaches southern history and literature at Emory University.

No stranger to the Civil War, Miles has five previous books and more than one hundred articles to his credit. <p> Beginning with Fort Sumter and concluding with Antietam, <b>Forged in Fire</b> amply shows Miles to be a knowledgeable guide to the people and events of 1861-65. He provides thorough accounts of the major actions, with his narrative supplemented by extensive photographs, illustrations, and maps. There are also numerous sidebars with background information on related people and places. <p> Miles's chapters are organized chronologically, and a battlefield tour is included at the end of each. Also, a tour of Civil War Richmond is found with the chapter on the Peninsula, and a tour of Harper's Ferry/John Brown's Raid is placed with the Antietam chapter. The tours are well-planned and highly detailed. The directions appear easy to follow, though a few are less than specific (""In some manner get back on Main Street""). Miles takes readers to major points of interest, and to spots that are off the beaten path, such as the long-forgotten remains of the Francis Bartow monument at Manassas. He warns all readers about trespassing, and reminds everyone to respect private property, even if there are earthworks or monuments to be found. <p> The tours also offer excellent examples of the urgent need for battlefield preservation. All too often, Miles points out that a particular site no longer exists, an important house has been destroyed, or an earthwork eliminated. <p> This book is not for the casual tourist or the family looking to squeeze in some history on the way to the beach. It is a comprehensive guide to complex military engagements. Civil War enthusiasts and history students will find <b>Forged in Fire</b> an excellent resource for visiting battlefields and understanding the nature and scope of the events. Tourists who prefer their information in a quick and snappy format may find the book intimidating. <p> <b>Forged in Fire</b> is the first in Miles's planned series of four volumes that will cover all the Civil War action in the East. If following volumes meet the standard set in this book, Miles will have compiled an indispensable resource. <p> <i>John E.

His very name describes the way he lives his life. Nothing comes easy for Thrasher. In his chores and in his relationships, he plods along -- always doubting his abilities, always feeling inadequate. After a particularly painful episode with his father, Thrasher feels the only way to redeem himself is to join the Confederate Army and prove that he is a man. <p>Bartoletti weaves fact and fiction, so that Thrasher's coming-of-age story is really a chronicle of the thousands of boys like him, North and South. Thrasher and his mess mates tell the story of all the boys who fought. Thrasher yearns to prove himself to be a man. Baylor longs for adventure and excitement. Wade joins to protect his home and family. Goodloe serves because it is the right thing to do. And Tim, whose true story is revealed to us only in the end, takes up the cause of the right of self-determination. <p>We follow the Okefinokee Rifles as they train for the glory of battle with the optimism of the young. And through their eyes we become a silent member of their company. We feel their spirits rise and fall as they await their baptism by fire. We enjoy the hijinks and comradery of camp life. We experience the tedium of picket guard duty. We trudge through the mud and the dust in seemingly endless marches. We feel the anger that the horrors of war engender in those who live it and the satisfaction that one feels in duty well done. We see the boys grow and change. <p>And in the book's most moving scene, we see the boys meet the enemy off the field of battle, banding together in an act of mercy. And in that act of mercy, the boys and we begin to understand a sobering fact. In other circumstances, those whom we see as enemies could be friends. <p>In the end, Thrasher and his mess mates ""see the elephant"" and are forever changed. The lessons they learn are timeless: the value of family and friendship, the power of the human spirit, and the importance of duty and honor. In <b>No Man's Land</b>, Susan Bartoletti presents us with these immutable human truths and helps us to see the Civil War through the microcosm of the Okefinokee Rifles. a<p><i>Meg Galante-DeAngelis of the University of Connecticut School of Family Studies has done historical research on the lives of children and families during the Civil War.</i>"	Galante-DeAngelis, Meg	Summer 1999	1999-06-01	Review	Thrasher Magee discovers there is more to manhood than battle	Coming of age	Blue Sky/Scholastic	0000-00-00				"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=237 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/BartolettiNoMansLand.jpg"">"

1561	042517672X		Sisters of Cain		Monfredo, Miriam Grace			In <b>Sisters of Cain</b>, the seventh book in Miriam Grace Monfredo's Seneca Falls chronicle, the plot heads south again with the outbreak of the Civil War. Bronwen and Kathryn Llyr, nieces of librarian Glynis Tryon, whose feminist activities began the Seneca Falls series of murder mysteries, now appear on the scene of 1862 America as, respectively, a Union spy for the Treasury Department's intelligence operations and a Union nurse in one of the makeshift hospitals in Washington, D.C. <p> Much of the plot for this tale hinges on the conflict between Lincoln and McClellan at the start of the Peninsula campaign of 1862 and also involves the fight between the <i>Monitor</i> and the <i>Merrimac</i> and a search for saboteurs who would destroy the Union's famous ironclad. Thrown into the mix are a secessionist attempt to assassinate Bronwen, a double agent betraying U.S. spies in Richmond, and a budding romance between Kathryn and Gregg Travis, a volunteer physician. Medicine, domestic and international politics, the Sanitary Commission, Dorothea Dix and her nurses, various Cabinet officers, and Richmond unionist Elizabeth Van Lew all show up as well. <p> Bronwen Llyr, the former Pinkerton detective turned Treasury agent, seems particularly ill-suited for the role of spy, being prone to rushing in where angels fear to tread, disobeying orders, and ignoring conventions that might better disguise her groundbreaking role as a woman spy. The most successful spies are, ultimately, the least conspicuous, and red-haired, hot-headed Bronwen is not possessed of the patience nor the aptitude for the discretion necessary in an espionage agent. She may be fun, but she's not convincing even as a mid-19th century renegade. <p> As has been true with all of Monfredo's mysteries, cameo appearances by noted historical figures of the time evince highly accurate research. The novelist's portrayal of Lincoln in particular is to be praised. She creates a president far more lifelike than the usual hagiographical figure that shows up in fiction and nonfiction alike. The plot and character development of the other players in her work, however, are a tad confusing and rushed, leaving the reader to desire a slower pace and less frenetic activity-in other words, a novel that reads more like a tale of the mid-19th rather than the late-20th century. <p> For fans of Monfredo, the mix of fact and suspense will no doubt satisfy. Scholars of the Civil War will find <b>Sisters of Cain's</b> mildly engaging text to be breezy and distinct from sedate renditions of the 19th century. <p> <i>Janet L.

1672	465013694		The Cousins' Wars: Religion, Politics, & the Triumph of Anglo-America	Cousins' Wars: Religion, Politics, & the Triumph of Anglo-America The	Phillips, Kevin			"In <b>The Cousins' Wars</b>, Kevin Phillips gives a remarkable account of the evolution of today's dominant power bloc and culture -- the Anglo-American one, whose language is the international tongue of commerce, computers, and air travel, and whose stronger partner, America, dominates the world, militarily and economically. The book focuses on the three principal conflicts within that culture which, he argues, largely shaped it: the English and U.S. Civil Wars and the American Revolution.<p>Phillips shows how ""recurrent threads"" connect the three conflicts: alignments of wartime loyalty that at least partly repeated themselves, together with the effect of each outcome in chastening aristocracy, monarchy, or High Church religion and in spurring economic modernization and westward or commercial expansion."" The author illustrates the sheer complexity of the divided loyalties in the English-speaking world in each conflict and outlines the little-known role of Americans on both sides of the English Civil War. He even reveals that this reviewer's own local paper, the <i>Kentish Gazette</i> (still publishing today under the same name), opposed military action against the colonists in the American Revolution.<p>The impact of Britain on the U.S. Civil War, and, in turn, its impact on Britain and her New World possessions (Canada and the West Indies) are carefully described. Throughout, Phillips identifies two communities in Britain: Eastern/Dutch/Puritan versus Northern and Western/Episcopalian/Catholic and illustrates their sister cultures in New England and the South. (The latter two were in temporary alliance in the American Revolution, but the Eastern/Puritan English were still sympathetic to their Yankee cousins.)<p>Rejecting the fashion for determinism, Phillips points out that any of the three wars easily could have gone the other way. He even hints that the British military commander, General Howe (who, ironically, doubled as a Member of Parliament elected on an anti-war platform), may have deliberately thrown decisive victory away by failing to support Burgoyne's Saratoga campaign. Lincoln is recognized for his brilliance in forging an unlikely coalition: he brought New England Yankees together with groups such as the Catholic Irish and the Germans whom they otherwise regarded as enemies.<p>Phillips is quite clear as to whom he believes deserved to win in each case: ""On the one side, in each war, were commerce, industry . . . reformist evangelical religion, and the proselytizing middle class. On the other side was landed agriculture, with its feudal remnants and hierarchical religion and its greater ratios of horsemen, soldiers, and cavaliers. At a certain point in each nation's history, it was a necessity . . . for the former to push aside the latter.""<p>While revealing his own view, he tries hard to be fair regarding the second and third of the three wars. For example, he reminds us of the extent to which the British defended American Indian rights against the colonists' aggression; he outlines the tariff demands of the North, which so threatened a Southern economy reliant on free trade; and he exposes the hypocrisy of the North in abandoning the blacks as soon as victory and Reconstruction had delivered Yankee commercial objectives.<p>Phillips is a political writer. This remarkable historical work is a bold attempt to underpin his individualistic Whig Protestant philosophy by tracing its successes through the generations. For those committed to an older, more traditional, organic conservatism, it cries out for an historical reply from a ""Tory"" historian of equal standing. Phillips's striving for balance in the latter two ""Cousins' Wars"" ultimately is undermined by his unbalanced analysis of the English Civil War, grounded in a fleeting caricature of the previous century, the century of the Reformation. Indeed, he paints the English Reformation as a straightforward matter of economic progress.<p>Yet, in his landmark novels, the (future) British Prime Minister, Benjamin Disr'li, a lapsed Anglican of Jewish origin, raised the battle cry for social and political reform in the Victorian Era by calling for a return to the institutions of pre-Reformation England. He paints it as a land of astonishing opportunity, in which a shepherd's son had risen to be pope and where social provision, from relief of poverty to education, was provided by the Church. He denounces Henry VIII's new <i>arriviste</i> upper middle class for seizing assets (including closing all the hospitals in London) and permanently kicking away the very ladders they had climbed, fossilizing the English class structure for centuries.<p>Phillips makes no mention of the popular risings (often unarmed) against these changes in the north and west of England. Nor is there a word about the hideous massacres of the protesters ordered by Henry VIII, sometimes using German mercenaries. He records with disapproval, however, the horrible moral decay into which these areas had descended two generations later. For Phillips, the rallying in these areas of such downtrodden people to a broad-minded king -- whom they perceived as standing against the tyranny of the new masters and their Dutch friends -- is just a matter of ignorance and graft. This alternate viewpoint is mentioned only indirectly, in a brief reference to a Confederate philosopher, George Fitzhugh, who harked back to the writings of Royalist Sir Robert Filmer.<p><b>The Cousins' War</b> lists a catalogue of British Victorian reforms as triumphs of ""British Whig and Liberal politics,"" yet many of the items listed, from Catholic Emancipation to reform of public health and urban conditions, were wholly or mainly Tory/Conservative measures, several of them introduced by Disr'li!<p>For Phillips human motivation is about ideology (religious and secular) and economics. He has little use for the organic institutions, arguably the best in the world, developed in Saxon and Medieval England. The Saxon Moots and Witan -- parent of Parliament and Congress -- are discussed just once. The early Norman kings combined Norman officers with the redoubtable Saxon Fyrd (militia), giving victories at Tinchebray, Crecy, and Agincourt; modernized by Elizabeth I in 1576, they begat the New World colonial militias and thence the Minutemen (and today's National Guard). <b>The Cousins' Wars</b> does not mention the pivotal role of these institutions at all.<p>Nor does it ask why individual Confederate soldiers -- most of them neither slave-owners nor experts on tariffs -- fought so unbelievably courageously for the South; or what role these militias played in the motivation of one of the best citizen armies of all time, which almost defeated a major industrial power. In his leap from the third ""Cousins' War"" to today, Phillips does not pause to ask what part the Crown, which he obviously despises, played in stiffening British morale and in attracting gallant volunteers from around the Empire. Churchill believed that the Crown played a vital part in the lonely British stand against Hitler. <p>Only a writer for whom political theory heroically transcends institutional detail could say ""the Restoration Parliament had wiped away Cromwell's electoral reforms and banned further democratization,"" albeit a decent interval after admitting that Cromwell had abolished Parliament and ruled as a dictator.<p>This is a heavyweight work; in its own terms, a landmark. Somewhere, there must be a Tory historian to give it the reply it deserves.<p><i>A former Oxford scholar and Territorial Army officer, Julian Brazier is Member of Parliament for Canterbury.</i>"	Brazier, Julian	Fall 1999	1999-09-01	Review	Did America's Civil War originate in England's?

2102	157249185X		Trial by Fire: Science, Technology, and the Civil War	Trial by Fire: Science, Technology, and the Civil War	Ross, Charles			"In <b>Trial by Fire</b>, Charles Ross presents an interesting book covering the applications of science and technology in the Civil War. Ross addresses the applications of existing technology to support combat forces and the applications of new technology to combat. While the book is not an exhaustive examination of the effect of technology in the War, it is a credible look at man and his application of science and technology in the art of war.<p>The book is divided into two sections. The first section is ""The Right Man for the Job"" and covers men who knew technology of the day and used it to influence the outcome of battles. Ross selects three individuals who applied contemporary technology to battlefield tactics: ""Henry Pleasants and the Mine at Petersburg""; ""Joseph Bailey and the Red Rivers Dams""; and ""George Washington Rains and Confederate Powder."" Of particular interest is the discussion of production of gunpowder for the Confederacy. This subject alone is worthy of extensive study, and Ross's work is a good place to start.<p>The second section is ""Technology Meets the Civil War."" It deals with newer technologies and their applications to warfare. Specifically Ross addresses submarine warfare, observation balloons, and the telegraph. The distinctions between this section and the previous section are at times not clear. For example: submarines were not new when the Civil War started and the men who applied the technology are as important in this section as in the previous. I find this a point to quibble over only for those who seek such points.<p><b>Trial by Fire</b> as a whole looks at technology as it was developed during this period and how it was applied to warfare. The work also covers the relations between men who knew the technology and the leaders who had to apply it. Ross does a credible job of pointing out the conflicts that arise between combat leaders and proponents of new technology. The latter are likely to be crusaders for their new method; the former must balance the need for success on the battlefield against the sometimes unfounded enthusiasm of ""technologists.""<p>The style of the work may be annoying to some readers. Ross gives hints of topics worthy of investigation, then drops them. At times he presents a scholarly style; at others, a more conversational tone. These are minor annoyances that in no way detract from the overall value of the book. Good footnotes, a bibliography, and appendices addressing some of the period's advanced technology provide a better understanding of the science involved. <b>Trial by Fire</b> is not the definitive work on this subject, but it is a fine place to begin.<p><i>William S.

1588	1886910316		Letters from Vinnie	Letters from Vinnie	Sappy, Maureen Stack			"In 1861 Vinnie Ream begins a nine-year correspondence with her friend, Regina. During that time Vinnie confides her concern about her family's worrisome finances, her feelings of adoration for newly inaugurated President Lincoln, her confusion over her brother's sympathy toward the Confederacy, and her own mixed feelings toward two potential suitors. Vinnie's letters detail the family's move to Washington, D.C., as well as the everyday pace of their lives during the War years.<p>Sappy's epistolary novel perfectly captures the tone of many Civil War correspondents: the overwrought phrasings, the sentimental tone, and the detailed narration. For example, when Vinnie learns of Regina's fianc's death at Castle Thunder prisoner of war camp, she writes: ""This is the most difficult letter I have ever written, for each word is torn from my heart. If I could hide the truth from you, I would -- but I cannot. Dear friend, your beloved Edward died early yesterday morning.""<p>Living in Washington, Vinnie has an insider's view of the War. Vinnie is an observer, not a player, however, and in order to bring her in contact with the events of the times, Sappy relies too much on coincidence. For example, Vinnie's sister goes on a date -- a picnic at Manassas on July 21, 1861. In another case, Vinnie and her mother enjoy an intimate tea -- an outing perfectly timed to coincide with the announcement of the Emancipation Proclamation. On another occasion, Vinnie attends Lincoln's second inauguration -- the receiving line parts, and Frederick Douglass appears, thus allowing Vinnie to introduce yet another historical figure in her narrative.<p>What the book offers is a readable, personal history of the War, including observations about its horrors (Vinnie visits hospitals) and its intrigues (she discusses McClellan's political aspirations and military failures). But history, even when well told, does not a novel make. What is lacking technically is strong characterization to move the episodic plot. Vinnie, who after the war sculpts the statue of Lincoln now in the rotunda of the Capitol, tells what she does but reveals little about the internal motives that drive her. For example, she dispassionately writes of her growing interest in sculpting, ""I haven't told you before because I didn't want you to think me a braggart, but I have already completed several busts of prominent Washingtonians."" Such reporting distances readers from Vinnie, who must ultimately carry the novel -- not as a character who witnesses many things, but as one who is herself worth knowing.<p><i>Betty Carter is a professor of children's and young adult literature in the School of Library and Information Studies at Texas Woman's University in Denton, Texas.</i>"	Carter, Betty	Fall 1999	1999-09-01	Review	War through the eyes of Lincoln's sculptress	Courageous dreamer	Front Street	0000-00-00				"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=241 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/SappyVinnieLetters.jpg"">"

2275	253338034		Homeless, Friendless, and Penniless: The WPA Interviews with Former Slaves Living in Indiana		Baker, Ronald L.	Federal Writers Project		"In 1936, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) Federal Writers' Project initiated a program to collect oral biographies and reminiscences from former slaves. Field workers solicited and edited thousands of slave narratives, some of which were sent to the Library of Congress, while others went to libraries in various states. In 1972, George P. Rawick published the Library of Congress's collection in 19 volumes, supplemented in 1977 and 1979 with two series from state libraries, making 41 volumes in all. The Indiana interviews deposited with the Library of Congress are in Volume 6 of Rawick's original series, while those at Indiana State University appear in Volume 5 of the first supplement. In <b>Homeless, Friendless, and Penniless</b>, Ronald L. Baker includes the interviews found in both of these volumes, as well as eight additional interviews from Indiana that had escaped Rawick's notice.  <p> The slave narratives must be used with caution. Rather than reproducing exactly what the former slaves related, field workers customarily edited the interviews. Most of the field workers were white, and it is impossible to know how accurately the former slaves recounted unpleasant episodes to white questioners. Finally, there remains an ill-defined but genuine gap between what former slaves thought about their lives and circumstances and what white field workers understood them to have said.  <p> Baker sees folklore as the primary value of the slave narratives, showing greater interest in overall patterns than in the historical detail the former slaves described. The folklore value is evident and substantial, but details from the individual lives ought not be ignored. They often confirm historical evidence from law courts, official reports, and census forms, and are thus emblematic of the general historical reality. <p> The narrative of Hettie McClain, related by her daughter-in-law, Adah Isabelle Suggs, contains two anecdotes that illustrate the impact of slavery upon free states. Hettie was the daughter of a slave, Hulda, and her owner, William McClain. To ensure that Hulda and Hettie would not be separated, McClain took them across the freedom line from Kentucky to Indiana, bought them a cottage, and emancipated them. Many owners took their slave mistresses and children to a free state, a practice which often led to lawsuits, some with constitutional implications. Suggs further related how her mother later was kidnapped and sold back into slavery, another scenario that was sufficiently widespread to have occasioned legal recourse.  <p> Confirming for Kentucky what Carl Schurz related about the Deep South in his 1865 Report to President Andrew Johnson, former slave John Rudd ""recalled seeing seven ex-slaves hanging from one tree...just after the close of the war."" But the accounts also reflect a variety of experiences. Robert J. Cheatham stated that Dr. Farmer, his former owner, neither bought nor sold slaves, and ""all of his slaves were pure black"" (which suggests that Dr. Farmer did not sire a second family, a frequent practice to which census reports give mute witness). <p> The collective memory of slavery contrasted monstrous cruelty with genuine care. Ellen Cane described her owner as a ""mean man"" who only fed his slave ""now and then."" Belle Butler remembered her mother's account about being owned by a ""a mean old devil"" who ""whipped his slaves for the slightest infraction and often he whipped them for nothing at all. He just enjoyed seeing them suffer."" Interviews with Mittie Blakely, Frank Cooper, Mattie Jenkins, and a dozen others confirmed hideous treatment. But James Childress recalled he was ""well fed, well clothed, and lived in good cabin."" Cheatham remembered being taught to read by Dr. Farmer, who did not beat his slaves, and Mrs. Robert Smith insisted that her relatives were sorry to ""leave their owners."" Still, several slaves remembered families broken up by owners, and John W. Fields related that: ""Twelve children were taken from my mother in one day!"" The final word belongs to Thomas Lewis: ""There was no such thing as being good to slaves.""  <p> Ronald Baker has done an excellent job of editing the WPA interviews, bringing those scattered in Rawick into a single edition and adding interviews that Rawick had not found. A good introduction and several useful appendices add to the value of the work. Both scholars and the interested reader will find this volume fascinating to read and easy to use.  <p> <i>James D.

2059	813918944		Southern Rights: Political Prisoners and the Myth of Confederate Constitutionalism		Neely Jr., Mark E.			"In 1978, the historian Richard Cobb published a short book, entitled <i>Death in Paris</i>, about the 400 or so Parisian suicides who found their way to the municipal morgue during the tumultuous years of the Jacobins and the Directory. Ostensibly local history, Cobb's book shows the continuity of bureaucracy, law, and social attitudes during a revolution, along with the continuing need for public order. His book is one of the important treatises on revolutionary France. <p>Mark E. Neely, Jr., in <b>Southern Rights</b>, has written on the same sort of technical topic in a slim treatise. Neely shows the continuity of social attitudes and legal habits, and the abiding need for social order in tumultuous years, in this case in the Confederacy at war. He has written a significant book on the Confederacy, which has implications both for the nature of Confederate government and for southern American society.<p><b>Southern Rights</b> takes as its thesis that the Confederate record on civil liberties, particularly habeas corpus, was shabby and disreputable, as several southern lawyers and a few judges pointed out at the time. The Confederate government treated civil liberties with suspicion and disregard that matched, perhaps exceeded, Union practices under Lincoln. Modern historiography maintaining that the Confederacy had a tender regard for civil liberties and habeas corpus has been at least misleading and unsupported by documents. <p>Neely has found large numbers of letters and reports in the archives of the Confederate War Department, documenting at least 4,100 political prisoners in the South, along with the correspondence of those who wanted passes or exemptions from conscription as well as the work of the loosely organized habeas corpus commissioners who examined the files of those apprehended for disloyalty or indiscreet talk. The correspondence and reports amounted to a substantial body of documents, filed randomly or under the names of the War Department commissioners, and thus hard to track down or classify. Neely has canvassed the records and put together the story of Confederate political prisoners and imposition of political orthodoxy.<p>Some generalizations can be made about the southern detainees and political prisoners. Many were poor and lacked social influence, and the majority were arrested in border areas, such as coastal Carolina, western Virginia, and eastern Tennessee. The rise in detentions along the borders mirrored the Union pattern, as did the effective suspension, both by law and by administrative usage, of habeas corpus. Many of the southern political prisoners, known to have opposed secession (and consequently hardly worthy of being considered ""true southern men""), were detained for their political opinions. Most were arrested for local, not national reasons; they disturbed their neighbors or the local military, not the central or even state governments. In general, the Confederacy had a civil liberties record similar to that of the Union -- not surprising, since the societies were both American and similarly were under the pressures of war.<p>The Confederacy did not suspend the writ of habeas corpus for the duration. The Confederate Congress suspended habeas corpus by statute from February 27, 1862, to February 13, 1863, and again from February 15, 1864, to July 31, 1864. In addition,  Jefferson Davis declared martial law over selected areas of the Confederacy. <p>But the Confederate government developed a formal system of administering political arrests: the habeas corpus commissioners housed in the War Department. The commissioners began work in September 1861, before martial law or the suspension of habeas corpus, and worked beyond the statutory suspension of the Great Writ. An informal body, operating without clearly defined duties and functioning for administrative convenience, the commissioners disposed of most cases of political prisoners that went up to Richmond. Neely describes them, on page 97, as a ""personnel office . . . disciplining difficult people"" in order to salvage some for Confederate service. This is not the usual definition of civil liberties law.<p>The habeas corpus commissioners functioned fundamentally within a culture of political solidarity. From the crisis years of the 1850s, the South had grown markedly less tolerant of dissent, and this preference of regional solidarity was accentuated by war and Reconstruction. In this excellent and important book on Confederate political prisoners, Mark E. Neely, Jr. has described a neglected chapter in the development of the southern identity, including a certain carelessness about civil liberties.<p><i>James D.

3533	1589803299	$29.95	Civil War on the Missouri-Kansas Border		Gilmore, Donald L.			In an effort to discourage Missouri from joining the ranks of the Confederacy, President Abraham Lincoln ordered a strong military presence to the Missouri-Kansas border region in the months prior to the Civil War.  Kansan soldiers supported by Union forces used the confiscation of private property, physical coercion, and martial law to frighten Missourians into submission.  These repeated incursions left Missourians with little choice but to retaliate.  In the years prior to and during the Civil War, they engaged in guerilla-like tactics against their aggressors and, in the process, were transformed from innocents into cold-blooded killers.

1425	811708861		Joshua Chamberlain: A Hero's Life & Legacy	Joshua Chamberlain: A Hero's Life & Legacy	Pullen, John J.			"In an era in which the very idea of heroism is mocked, the anti-hero is celebrated, and military virtues in particular are far from popular, it is refreshing to encounter a book that, like an unflawed mirror, reflects the career of a man who both as a soldier and a citizen justly deserves the title of hero.<p>Not that John J. Pullen's portrait is lacking in objectivity or is in any way approaching hagiography, for he is most careful in distinguishing between facts and the nimbus of mythology, which lately by fiction and film has enhanced the image of Joshua Chamberlain. No. The author points out that the mythic element rests on a firm foundation of fact that has been a catalyst to the mythic aura and that mythology itself is not to be despised as a motivator of noble behavior.<p>The bayonet charge at Little Roundtop at Gettysburg, which was so crucial in that battle, was not the only act of heroism in Chamberlain's life, as Pullen amply demonstrates. Yet in a sense it defined his character, initiated his fame, and echoed in the background of a long life with many trials. The primary focus of the book is upon Chamberlain's career after the Civil War -- and that was, at least in its early stages, a political career.<p>Pullen shows why Chamberlain was not cut out to be a successful politician. He was a man of principle, uncompromising in his values, and therefore it is not surprising that he made enemies. When faced with a choice -- between the general good and humane behavior, or party loyalty and political expediency that might further his own self-interest -- he always chose the noble path.<p>He was four times elected governor of Maine as a Republican, but as Pullen calls him, a ""reluctant Republican."" The Republican Party leader, James G. Blaine, and the Radical Republicans in control of Congress in the Reconstruction years wished to reduce the Southern states to the status of territories. Chamberlain declined to follow the party line. At Appomattox he had gallantly offered an arms salute of his men to the surrendering Confederate officers. He opposed legislation that would, in effect, bar responsible white Southerners from any public post of leadership, and he opposed the unconstitutional infringements on President Andrew Johnson's powers. He resisted the extreme Prohibitionists in his party and enforced a court verdict of capital punishment for a cruel and brutal double murder by a black man. The result of taking these unpopular stands was political eclipse.<p>But his career of service to the people of Maine was not over. He initiated forward-looking reforms in education as president of Bowdoin College, saved Maine from threatened civil war over an election controversy as adjutant general, and faithfully carried out his duties in the humble office of surveyor of customs in Portland in his declining years. Despite decades of obscurity immediately following his death in 1914, of late his fame has revived through books and film and wide public recognition. Pullen's book is a worthy tribute to Chamberlain's lasting legacy.<p><i>Charles F.

2141	820321303		Black Judas: William Hannibal Thomas and 'The American Negro'		Smith, John David			"In early 1865, the 5th United States Colored Troops, fresh from victory at Fort Fisher, moved north toward Wilmington, North Carolina, and attacked a Confederate force blocking its path. During the battle, a musket ball tore into the arm of Sergeant William Hannibal Thomas. The shot ended Thomas's career as a soldier, cost him the lower third of his arm, and, according to his biographer John David Smith in <b>Black Judas</b>, shaped the rest of his life.   <p>After recovering in army hospitals, Thomas returned to his native Ohio and then enrolled in the Western Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania, where shortly before graduation he was expelled when it was learned that he had had sex with his wife before he married her. Next Thomas worked as a fundraiser for Wilberforce University, but had to quit after being charged with financial irregularities. Throughout the remainder of his life, Smith demonstrates, Thomas would work hard, achieve some success, only to lose it after sexual or financial misdeeds. Thomas next went south where, first in Georgia and then in South Carolina, he pursued educational and religious causes and became active in Republican Party politics. New charges of corruption and the end of Reconstruction eventually forced him to return north. After that, Thomas moved around, took various jobs, and wrote often about his fellow African Americans.   <p>While in the army, the northern-born Thomas had become very critical of southern blacks, but in the late 1880s and early 1890s, he expressed a more positive view and worked in behalf of land reform and industrial education for blacks. In the late 1890s, his views changed yet again; in 1901 he published The American Negro, which condemned black women as sexually licentious, denounced black men as beasts, and portrayed all blacks, in Smith's words, ""in the harshest and crudest of terms as physiologically, intellectually, morally, and culturally inferior to whites."" The book advocated a restriction on the political rights of blacks, physical force to restrict their behavior, and orphanages to reeducate their children. The central theme of <i>The American Negro</i>, however, was ""that behavior and character, not color, determined whether or not a person should be designated a 'Negro.'"" <p>Not surprisingly, <i>The American Negro</i> appalled other African Americans, who denounced Thomas as a race traitor, a ""Black Judas."" Smith does an excellent job of recounting the resulting controversy and putting Thomas's thought in the context of its time. Smith has also performed a herculean job of research in locating other of Thomas's writings and in reconstructing his life. Smith is at times justifiably scathing in his evaluations of Thomas but, to his credit, always takes Thomas seriously and strives to understand his motives.  <p>Thomas's condemnation of his fellow African Americans resulted from the interaction of the effects of white racism and his Civil War wound, Smith concludes. Thomas encountered racial discrimination in college and, at the beginning of the Civil War, the army refused to let him enlist because he was black. Deeply scarred by these affronts, frustrated by years of battling on behalf of blacks, and faced with rampant, rabid racism in the 1890s, Thomas tried to re-invent himself. By making character, not color, the basis of whether or not someone was a ""Negro,"" Thomas -- a light-skinned man of mixed racial ancestry -- sought an identity for himself as something other than a ""Negro."" Through a careful reading of Thomas's writings, Smith makes a convincing case for the way in which white racism led Thomas to his own racial calumny. <p>Smith has much less concrete evidence to draw upon in explaining the role of Thomas's war wound. Thomas suffered, Smith maintains, from post-traumatic stress disorder and a ""repetition compulsion"" related to his amputation. Both contributed to his personal failings as well as to his tendency to project those failings onto others, as he did on the black population of the South in <i>The American Negro</i>. Persisting pain from his amputation, Smith adds, also contributed to Thomas's attacks on the African Americans after 1894. Smith's case for the continuing influence of Thomas's disability is intriguing, plausible, yet not fully convincing. Nevertheless, anyone interested in the impact of Civil War combat on its veterans should read <b>Black Judas</b>. So, too, should anyone interested in race relations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.<p><i>Gaines M.

1421	813121086		For Honor, Glory & Union: The Mexican and Civil War Letters of Brig. Gen. William Haines Lytle	For Honor Glory & Union: The Mexican & Civil War Letters of Brig. Gen. William Haines Lytle	Carter, Ruth C.			"In her well-documented introduction to wartime letters of William Haines Lytle (1826-1863), editor Ruth C. Carter characterizes Ohio's poet-general as the epitome of the Southern cavalier -- vain, romantic, schooled in the social graces yet also pro-slavery, politically active, and a Douglas Democrat. According to Carter, only Lytle's fervent nationalism prevented him from fighting for the Confederacy. Lytle's family roots were in the Blue Grass state, and several Kentucky cousins served in the Confederate Army. However, it is difficult to imagine this third generation Cincinnati lawyer-politician and major general in the Ohio militia as captivated by the Southern ethos as Carter would have readers believe.<p><b>No hint of disloyalty to the Union</b><p>Although the letters Lytle wrote from Bardstown, his ancestral home, reflect his continuing affection for friends and relations, as well as his desire for leniency toward the civilian population, they contain not the slightest hint of disloyalty toward the Union. Carter also sees Lytle as emotionally and psychologically adrift in the decade before the Civil War, a victim of inner turmoil resulting from his inability to meet his family's high expectations (either at the bar or in the political arena) and his two failed romances. He found relief in drink and poetic composition.<p>All but three of the 106 autographed letters published by Carter are in the collections of the Cincinnati Historical Society. Except for a few colorful descriptions of the Mexican landscape, churches, and people, the 15 letters Lytle wrote home during the final months of the Mexican War are disappointing. He entered the War late, and his regiment, the 2nd Ohio Volunteers, served as part of the force of occupation for Mexico City and vicinity. Although he rose quickly from lieutenant to captain in Company L, he seems to have been bored.<p>The Mexican experience served Lytle well in the Civil War. He knew how to command and maintain the respect of rough recruits. Although his writing skills and powers of observation had not changed, there was more to report. Readers will enjoy Lytle's unrestrained and honest remarks on military and personal affairs. The advantages and disadvantages of rank, for example, are reflected in frequent references to the ""Professor,"" John Wilson, a black servant. Also, Lytle was not ashamed to acknowledge the burden of responsibility he felt for the lives of his men. The war scenes that touched him deeply involved loyalists and secessionists alike. He found the citizens of Huntsville, Alabama, ""a splendid people,"" but he also bemoaned the sufferings of unionists in eastern Tennessee.<p>An all-too-prevalent theme in Lytle's letters is the delay in his promotion to brigadier general. The source of the delay may have been Lytle's own physical condition. He received a severe leg wound in the Battle of Carnifex Ferry in 1861. The wound was slow to heal, and when the Army of Ohio took the field in 1862, Lytle was left behind to train new recruits. Later that year, from May to the end of August, he performed garrison duty at Huntsville, Alabama, protecting the Federal supply line.<p>During Bragg's invasion of Kentucky, Lytle got back into the fray at the head of the 17th Brigade, 3rd Division, Army of the Ohio, only to be wounded in the head and left for dead at the Battle of Perryville. His capture and parole further delayed his advance in rank. Subsequently exchanged, promoted (March 1863), and returned to duty, on September 20, 1863, he was again wounded, this time fatally.<p><i>John R.

"In July 1864 as Confederate general Jubal Early's 14,000-man army threatened to invade Washington, D.C., the Union naval ship <i>U.S.S. Malvern</i> hurriedly steamed up the Potomac River to aid in the national  capital's defense. <p>When she arrived on July 14, no enemy could be seen, so a party of the ship's officers ""marched bravely through the city's streets and safely arrived at Williard's [Hotel], where we made a few inquiries of the barkeeper,"" wrote the author of this account of the Civil War. <p>Finding no rebels to oppose, the officers quickly repaired to the billiard room for a ""furious engagement"" of pool-shooting, fueled by ample amounts of spirits, keeping ""several waiters on a constant run"" to the bar. <p>If this comic picture of gathering intelligence from a bartender and playing billiards while the enemy rattles the gates of the city strikes the reader as bizarre, this little episode also illustrates the value of this previously unpublished memoir by a junior staff officer in Abraham Lincoln's navy. <b>Under the Blue Pennant</b> is a rare type of Civil War history, a naval memoir that observes the war-on-the-water from the perspective of a relatively low-ranking participant.<p>In contrast to the outpouring of diaries, letters, and post-war reminiscences of Civil War soldiers, North and South, relatively little has been published from the pens of sailors and naval officers. While this book is little more than a series of interesting snapshots of the naval war, it helps fill that memoir gap by offering the experiences and insights of a young admiral's clerk who wrote with enthusiasm, eye for detail, and a blend of excitement and amusement.<p>The book is limited in its perspective and time period. Acting ensign John W. Grattan, 20 years old when he became an admiral's clerk aboard the flagship of the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron in October 1863, wrote about the final 18 months of the war. He saw action only along the Virginia and North Carolina coasts and navigable rivers, but that included important engagements around Richmond, Norfolk, and Wilmington, North Carolina, among others. Grattan's writing is vivid and detailed. His subjects range from enforcing the Union's naval blockade of the South to important joint army-navy engagements.<p>Grattan also contributes fascinating vignettes of shipboard life (and death), ranging from the picture of the ship's officers dressed in ""scanty feminine wardrobe"" dancing in drag in the wardroom, to the grisly images of seamen blown to pieces by incoming shells. The author offers interesting personal glimpses of admirals Samuel Phillips Lee and David Dixon Porter, for whom he worked, and sharp opinions on such figures as Union general Benjamin Butler, whom he brands as an incompetent coward.<p>A lengthy, 50-page introduction by naval historian Robert J. Schneller, while feeling a bit overlong, helps sketch Grattan's background and places Civil War naval operations into a larger perspective. For lovers of naval minuti, there is a highly detailed appendix giving the specifications of every ship mentioned in the volume. The book is excellently illustrated, including sketches of ships and battles drawn by Grattan himself. The major shortcoming of this book is its lack of adequate maps; the few small, hard-to-read maps included here are little help to the reader trying to puzzle out battle actions in unfamiliar rivers, bays, and coastlines. <p><b>Under the Blue Pennant</b> is a small, long-submerged treasure that will reward those willing to give in to the unfamiliar waters of the Civil War's naval history.<p><i>Journalist and historian James P.

2196	1557286213		Widows by the Thousand: The Civil War Correspondence of Theophilus and Harriet Perry, 1862-1864		Johansson, M. Jane	Perry, Harriet	Perry, Theophilus	"In May 1862, Theophilus Perry, an attorney in Marshall, Texas, reluctantly left his wife and baby daughter to enlist as an officer in the 28th Texas Cavalry. For the next two years, the Perrys endured a relentless string of tragedies. Not long after the death of their daughter in 1863, Harriet received the news that two of her brothers had been killed in battle. During this time, Theophilus, too, lost members of his extended family, and ultimately perished himself from a wound received at Pleasant Hill in April 1864. <p> Editor M. Jane Johansson, historian and author of  <i>Peculiar Honor: A History of the 28th Cavalry, 1862-1865</i>, explains that part of what makes the publication of this correspondence so important is its rarity. Not only have few letter collections of married couples of the Confederacy been published, but those of couples living in the westernmost regions of the Trans-Mississippi Theater are scarcer still. <p> Though <b>Widows by the Thousand</b> is valuable to scholars for its details about Confederate camp life and the isolated east Texas home front (including its daily life, agriculture, slavery, and sex roles), the Perrys' correspondence is most noteworthy for its abundant revelations about their emotional lives. In intimate language, Harriet and Theophilus elaborate on their love for one another, the agony of their separation, their battles with grief and depression, and their determination to cling to their religious faith. Striking, too, is the evidence of how they used letter writing-their only contact-to sustain their bond. <p> Harriet's frank discussion of sexuality and reproduction, topics mid-19th century female correspondents rarely address, are remarkable for this era. With candor, she complains of the pain of breastfeeding and post-partum piles, and proudly records her second child's demands for her breast. She conveys her terror at approaching childbirth and prepares Theophilus for her death. And, in several letters to Theophilus, she asserts her expectation that she will be spared the birth of more children, declaring that they both must take care that she bear no further offspring. <p> Theophilus, a hard-headed realist, harbors no illusions about the future of the South after the war, and is convinced that he must prepare his family for the South's economic collapse. During the first year of their separation, he instructs Harriet to pay off all their debts. Once accomplished, he becomes obsessed with buying a small farm where they can begin anew after the war. Their exchanges about money and land reveal how the war has shifted the power balance in their relationship. In her husband's absence, Harriet assumes progressively more of the decision-making responsibilities. Though she dutifully inquires about land as her husband bids her, in ensuing letters she persuades him that the lack of acreage and skyrocketing prices render his plan unwise. In an about-face, he relents, writing, ""You have acted right in not buying land. I approve your judgement."" A year after Theophilus's death, Harriet returned to live with her family in North Carolina, where she remained until her death in 1885. <p> Johansson's editing is meticulous, if not obsessively so. The volume's organization into chapters, each preceded by a topical introduction, makes for easy reading and reference. The correspondence is followed by a brief epilogue, 56 pages of notes, a bibliography, and an index. <b>Widows by the Thousand</b> is an important addition to the literature documenting family life in the Civil War era. <p> <i>Judith E.

1625	689823797		Dear Ellen Bee: The Civil War Scrapbook of Two Union Spies		Lyons, Mary E.	Branch, Muriel Miller		"In the fictional <b>Dear Ellen Bee: A Civil War Scrapbook of Two Union Spies</b>, friendship, intrigue, danger, and courage are woven together to flesh out a little-known story in history. The result is remarkable, and leaves the reader wishing more was known about the real lives of these two fascinating women. <p> Unfortunately, there is little historical information about Mary Eliza (""Liza"") Bowser, the youthful black woman who is one of the heroines of this young adult book. It is believed that an album kept by Bowser was thrown away by relatives in the 1950s. Only slightly more is known about the other heroine, Elizabeth (""Miss Bet"") Van Lew, a white southern woman and Liza's former mistress. As the authors note, only 400 pages of Van Lew's 700-page diary survive, and very few factual references are made to her diary in the book. And yet, while it is a work of fiction, it reads like an engrossing nonfiction history. <p> The concept of using an album or scrapbook to tell their combined story works wonderfully. Keeping scrapbooks was a common activity for women in the 19th century. The books served as a place to record thoughts and to collect and preserve memorabilia. In the prologue, Liza, now 52 years old, presents the scrapbook to her niece, Polly, and explains how it came to include both Liza and Miss Bet's correspondence. To make things easier for the reader, Liza's pages are identified by a leaf, and Miss Bet's pages by a vine. These elements are helpful but almost unnecessary because the distinct personalities and voices of these two women - one a rebellious young former slave, the other a wealthy and privileged white woman - permeate the narrative. <p> <b>Dear Ellen Bee</b> begins in the years before the Civil War and is set mostly in Richmond. Liza is the young daughter of two Van Lew servants and the favorite of Miss Bet, who decides to send her north to be educated. They have a difficult relationship, however. Liza sees Miss Bet's concern for her as bossiness, and becomes determined to show Miss Bet that she doesn't ""own"" her. She returns to Richmond engaged, and is married despite Miss Bet's initial objections. Liza defies her benefactress again when she insists on living in an unsafe part of town. But despite their frustrations with each other, they have a strong connection. This bond is soon put to the test. <p> The Civil War, which has been looming in the background of the story, begins to dramatically affect the lives of these characters. Miss Bet, a Union sympathizer, had freed the Van Lew slaves before the War. But her growing concern for the Union prisoners being kept in a Richmond jail spur her into greater action. She secretly begins to spy and plot ways to help prisoners escape. Despite her fear at endangering Liza, Miss Bet asks her to help. Reluctant at first, Liza finally agrees. <p> Miss Bet arranges for Liza to be placed as a servant in the Confederate White House of Jefferson Davis. And thus is born Ellen Bee, the code name that Liza and Miss Bet use for each other. For about two years, Liza poses as an ignorant servant in the Davis home. She is the eyes and ears for Miss Bet and Union contacts, passing on any information that might be helpful to the North.  <p> Set with the backdrop of the Civil War and including in secondary roles the historical figures of Jefferson Davis and his family as well as various Union and Confederate officers, it is easy to forget that this is a fictional story. Interspersed throughout the book/scrapbook are historical documents or images such as broadsides, press clippings, photographs, and drawings. Again, these lend a feeling of authenticity to the narrative.  <p> As Liza tells her niece in the epilogue: ""A young black woman, an older white one . . . together we made history. So now you know who Ellen Bee was, Polly. She was a hero. And now that you have her scrapbook, maybe one day someone else will know it, too."" The irony is that we probably will never know the real story, but thanks to authors Mary E. Lyons and Muriel M. Branch, we meet two remarkable Civil War women and get an exciting peek at what might have been.  <p> <i>Meg Chorlian is the editor of </i>Cobblestone, <i>the American history magazine for young people.

2060	1574410776		Voices in the Storm: Confederate Rhetoric, 1861-1865		Fritz, Karen E.			"In the months leading up to the War and indeed through the duration of the conflict, one heard speeches everywhere in the South, according to <b>Voices in the Storm</b>, a short volume by historian Karen E. Fritz. Speechmaking at first created, then sus-tained, and in the end reflected, the mood of the Confederacy as the War progressed from its euphoric beginnings to its bitter denouement.  <p>In <b>Voices in the Storm</b>, Fritz argues that neither the War nor the life of the Confederacy can be understood without understanding how oratory became a ""common cultural expression, a medium through which Southerners interpreted their surroundings, and described their fellow citizens."" Given the prominence of oratory in the 19th century South, its role in the war effort is not surprising. Fritz describes in the introduction how, when chronicling speeches on the southern home front throughout the conflict, she arrived at the unexpected conclusion that ""Southerners, engulfed in turmoil of war, listened as orators gradually shaped them and their nation into rhetorical facsimiles of their enemy. This suggests that separation at some level effected reunion."" Thus, the radical dichotomy depicted by speechmakers between the South and the North helped prosecute the war, but it ultimately turned reactionary and unwittingly formed a bridge to reunification.<p>Fritz's approach is thematic as well as chronological. She shows how radically three principal themes in speeches -- nature, slavery, and gentlemanly character -- shifted between 1861 and 1864-65 as the War increasingly disrupted and dispirited Southerners at home. Portrayals of the landscape evolved from God-given grandeur to desolation and grim, antagonistic elements. Discussions of slavery were generally avoided by speechmakers except in the War's earliest and latest stages, but images of slaves also shifted from being ""happy laborers"" to ""savage enemies"" whose distrust of their masters hindered the war effort. The attributes of the gentleman were extended in early speeches to men of all ranks (especially to the common soldier), but this evocation of chivalry would be undermined at home by profiteering and self-interest, qualities previously reserved for Northerners.  <p>Using modern rhetorical analysis, the author penetrates the ebullience of early speeches, which aimed to instill confidence and instruction, to find that many were preoccupied with defining basic concepts such as <i>nation</i> and <i>liberty</i>, a rhetorical strategy that addressed uncertainty and doubts about the new nation's resolve. Indeed, this implicit soul-searching facilitated a shift in perception that by 1864 had brought many to self-condemnation for the South's destruction. <p>In addition to rhetorical analysis, Fritz uses content analysis, based largely on the terms and descriptions Southerners used for themselves, to develop her arguments. These methodologies are used successfully and satisfyingly, in that they are unobtrusive, unencumbered by technical terminology, and aptly supported by excerpts. But they are inevitably handicapped, as the author indicates, by reliance on printed sources: texts that were probably revised after oral delivery, belated and often indirect reports of audience reactions, few indications of the elements of delivery, and so forth. Some readers will miss the lack of scholarly apparatus, even in the footnotes, that would provide quantitative support for the author's arguments. This absence will not concern most, however, who will find <b>Voices in the Storm</b> an insightful and in some ways provocative work.<p><i>Michl Montgomery, emeritus professor of English at the University of South Carolina, was consulting editor for language in the Encylopedia of Southern Culture.

1894	807825654		This Astounding Close: The Road to Bennett Place		Bradley, Mark L.			In the popular imagination, the image of Robert E. Lee and Ulysses S. Grant amicably discussing surrender terms in William McLean's parlor on April 9, 1865, symbolizes the end of the Civil War. The subsequent proceedings at Bennett Place, North Carolina, have often been an obscure footnote to the story of the Confederacy's collapse, even though Joseph E. Johnston's negotiations with William T. Sherman resulted in the surrender of 90,000 Confederates, the largest of the War. <p> In a superb study that incorporates the best of new military history, Mark L. Bradley makes it clear that Johnston's surrendering of the Army of Tennessee was not an inevitable consequence of Appomattox, nor an event of limited significance. In its discussion of the 1865 North Carolina campaign, <b>This Astounding Close</b> outlines the contours of the armies' movements, paying close attention to the logistical concerns and political pressures facing both generals. With tremendous care, Bradley shows how North Carolina civilians interacted and shaped the operations of the Confederate and Union armies. <p> Although many Tar Heels were weary of the War, Bradley puts to rest the notion that North Carolinians had abandoned the cause. Even the controversial Governor Zebulon Vance comes across in Bradley's pages as a devoted Confederate, not as a states' rights obstructionist. He energetically supported national armies whenever possible, delivering patriotic speeches while searching for ways to supply Southern forces without imposing civilian hardship. He did not want to drive his fellow Tar Heels out of the Confederacy through excessively intrusive measures. Bradley's provocative interpretation of  Vance underscores the need for a re-evaluation of the governor's wartime career.  <p> In the case of Sherman, Bradley assumes a more critical stance. Allowing the Confederate army to escape after the battle of Bentonville on March 19 enabled Johnston to take his army into the interior of the state, from where the Confederate commander advocated a linkage with Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. Johnston, it appears, had learned from the mistake of dispersing Confederate forces at Vicksburg. Lee and Confederate authorities, on the other hand, were preoccupied with Richmond, missing an opportunity to unite their forces with the Army of Tennessee's 30,000 men, which if combined would have put more than 80,000 men in the field. Had Lee been at the helm of such an army, Bradley believes the War could have been extended indefinitely.  <p> Even after Lee's surrender, Johnston negotiated from a position of strength, largely because his smaller and more mobile army was beyond Sherman's immediate reach. Over the adamant protests of Jefferson Davis, Johnston courageously initiated negotiations with Sherman and relentlessly pursued his goal of stopping the bloodshed. When Washington authorities voided Sherman's more liberal concessions, granted in the initial surrender meetings, Johnston remained firm that his men take home their draft animals, field transportation, and one-seventh of their rifle muskets. Unlike Sherman, whom Bradley criticizes for failing to understand the political climate after Lincoln's assassination, Johnston was far more astute about the realities facing the South. In navigating the ebbing but treacherous political waters of the Confederacy, Johnston gained favorable terms for his men, maybe his most impressive and lasting contribution to the Civil War. <p> <i>Peter S.

2207	820320447		Recollections of a Southern Daughter: A Memoir by Cornelia Jones Pond of Liberty County	Recollections of a Southern Daughter: A Memoir by Cornelia Jones Pond of Liberty County	MacKethan, Lucinda H.			In the recent past, an excellent variety of biographies, diaries, and memoirs have been published about women during the Civil War period. Among those have been accounts of nurses, spies, and extraordinary women. Others recount the lives of ordinary women living in extraordinary times. In the latter lie some of the more interesting stories. One is that of Cornelia Jones Pond (1834-1902).<p>Pond's memoir spans most of her life. She begins by describing her childhood at Tekoah plantation in Liberty County, Georgia. Born into an educated and affluent family, she lived an idealized life in antebellum society. The daughter of a rice planter, Cornelia was raised 30 miles south of Savannah in a rural and isolated plantation society. Her formal education began at the unusually early age of five. Pond attended a local academy where she learned mathematics, algebra, Latin, and geometry. She continued her formal education in the local school until her father sent her to Macon in 1849 to a private girl's school, and later to the Methodist Female College in Madison, Georgia. Though her education comprised the ordinary training of the day, including art and music for ladies, it stands out for its progressiveness.<p>Much of Pond's childhood memoir is filled with stories of tea parties, dances, descriptions of fashions, and her various travels with family to visit relatives throughout Georgia. Though mundane, these vignettes of the period lend detail and texture to what was a pleasant and quickly passing period of antebellum life.<p>Pond also notes in detail her experiences in attending the Congregational Church. Though she is repeatedly observant of her religious activities, she never speaks of her religious views or her spirituality. This is a recurring theme through the memoir as Pond rarely reveals her emotions or interprets her responses to life around her. She merely and dutifully reflects what she sees, allowing the reader (her intended audience being her immediate family) to interpret her experiences for themselves.<p>She met her future husband, a mathematics professor, in 1851. Cornelia married Thomas Goulding Pond in July 1853. He would pursue teaching, engineering, and ministry in his life, providing Pond with an affluent lifestyle, a large family of daughters, and a close-knit extended family. Upon the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Pond's domestic life quickly unraveled. Thomas was in a local militia, later joined the engineering corps, and spent a brief period in the Confederate artillery. The extent of the war years would take him away from home for months at a time, leaving Pond to look after her children and her extended family.<p>In 1861 she lost a daughter to scarlet fever, vacated her house, and had a husband at war. But her memoir reveals a quiet and reflective woman who took the changes in stride and focused on family life. Some of the few passages in the memoir that really reflect pride are those in which she explains the substitutes that she and her family devised to survive (weaving palmetto hats, making dye from bark and berries, making opium from poppies, etc.) She also speaks fondly of the details of a relative's wedding, and of her relationships with family slaves. <p>The stress of war is more accurately reflected in the later passages in which Pond describes the absence of communication between her husband and herself from December 1864 to April 1865, due to the effects of Sherman's March to the Sea. She relates the loss of silver, horses, food, and jewelry to Federal soldiers, and the family's fear of constant raids on their home.<p>The memoir ends with the years immediately following the war in which Cornelia and Thomas settled into a new home, and reestablished their lives. Thomas would eventually take orders as an Episcopalian minister, and the family lived relatively well. <p>Pond's memoir is a short account in itself. MacKethan has done an admirable task in presenting an introduction to the memoir, and in doing so, creating a basis for understanding Pond's place in antebellum Georgia. It was intertwined by blood with the LeContes of Georgia (<i>When the World Ended: The Diary of Emma LeConte</i>, 1957), and paralleled the lives of another regional family, the Charles Colcock Jones family (<i>The Children of Pride</i>, 1972). <p>Unlike more prominent diarists such as Sarah Morgan, Mary Chesnut, or Pauline Heyward, Pond's story is simple but gripping, and lacks the literary passages or reflective examination of the soul so often exhibited by Victorian women writers of the period. She was rather a simple woman, laying out her story for her family. MacKethan has included an afterword on Pond's last years and biographical descriptions of her immediate family and neighbors noted in the memoir. Unfortunately, the book lacks maps, illustrations, or an index, which would have added to the research value of this newly published source. But Cornelia Jones Pond is still a life worth reading.<p><i>Karen R Mehaffey is an academic library director in Detroit.

2159	195136837	$35.00	Southern Families at War: Loyalty and Conflict in the Civil War South		Clinton, Catherine			"In the spring of 1998, dozens of scholars gathered at the University of Richmond to examine the social history of the Civil War era. As Catherine Clinton, the organizer of that conference and editor of <b>Southern Families at War</b>, declares in her introduction to this anthology, Civil War history ""once . . . might have been viewed as a fortress, the gates open only to students of military history and militants."" However, with the ""seismic changes"" within the last generation of historians, ""the field seems to have been invaded by . . . a diversity of disciplines, pursuing multiple and competing agendas with zeal and abandon."" <p> Clinton herself has been responsible for much of this development, as author and editor of several other volumes of essays on the Civil War home front. Even books of essays in well-known and martial-sounding series do not always restrict themselves to military topics. Gary Gallagher, editor of UNC Press's Military Campaigns of the Civil War series, says the field is a ""big tent"" that has room for historians with many points of view, historiographical agendas, and approaches to research. <p> ""Families at war"" is used by Clinton partly as a metaphor for the War itself, but most of the essays in this collection actually do explore how warfare affected southern families. The battles all occur offstage, but they clearly alter the trajectories of individual Southerners and of the South as a whole. Some essays describe the experiences of individual families, such as Daniel W. Stowell's Fains of East Tennessee; Anne J. Bailey's German-speaking Texans, the Coreths; and Judith Lee Hunt's Middletons of Charleston, South Carolina. The majority, however, explore issues that divided families, challenged prewar values and assumptions, or reflected the deep emotional impact of the War on Southerners. <p> The chief strength of this engrossing and important anthology is its diversity and its attempt to show that, for most Southerners, the Civil War was just a part of the larger narrative arcs of their lives. For instance, the first three essays deal with the black experience during and after the War. Michl P. Johnson shows the heartbreaking attempts by former slaves to find lost relatives after emancipation. Michelle A. Krowl examines the ways that black women pressed U.S. government officials and army officers for various forms of aid and education. In the third piece, Donald R. Schaffer suggests that slave marriage customs - the practice of common-law marriage and, in a sense, common-law divorce - continued long after the Civil War, at least among black veterans and their significant others. <p> It is impossible to describe each of the 12 pieces in detail here, but readers will be rewarded with essays by Amy E. Murrell and Jennifer Lynn Gross on the ambiguity with which wives and widows of Confederate soldiers conducted seemingly strained relations with their southern governments. Also, E. Susan Barber examines the effect of the War on marriages in Richmond, where nuptials were hurried during the War and where, afterwards, gender imbalance and the presence of large numbers of widows changed the face of society. <p> Familiar themes appear throughout <b>Southern Families at War</b>: honor, patriarchy, evangelicalism, the ""Lost Cause."" But at least two essays offer stories and approaches that are quite original. Lauren F.  Winner writes of conversions of southern Jews to Christianity, which typically occurred when Jewish husbands away at war or wives back home were swept up in local revivals. Winner focuses on the disruptions those conversions created in the lives of Jewish families already marginalized in the Protestant South. In another essay, Christian beliefs - specifically beliefs concerning salvation and the afterlife - are examined by Ted Ownby, who argues that the War could sometimes inspire religious fervor in soldiers, causing them to write about their images of heaven, which were without strife, patriarchal relationships, or slaves. <p> Inevitably, there are omissions: more might have been included on subjects such as veterans, children, the changing nature of wartime slavery and relationships between masters and slaves, and the effects of the War on family-oriented institutions like churches and orphanages. However, the listing of these neglected topics is not meant to be a criticism, but rather a recognition of current Civil War social historians' creativity and excellence, the very characteristics abundantly displayed in this fine collection.  <p> <i>James Marten (<A HREF=""mailto:james.martin@marquette.edu"">james.martin@marquette.edu</a>) is professor of history at Marquette University and author of a number of books, including</i> The Children's Civil War <i>(1998).

1448	684855151		Lincoln: A Foreigner's Quest		Morris, Jan			"In war: resolution. In defeat: defiance. In victory: magnanimity. In peace: goodwill."" If Jan Morris has captured her subject with any degree of accuracy, those words by Sir Winston Churchill might aptly have draped Lincoln's funeral train as it snaked its way to Springfield, Illinois. Lincoln is the central hero in Churchill's <i>The American Civil War</i>, and Churchill, of course, shared that hero's ""almost lackadaisical genius"" and ""hopeful fatalism"" (in Morris's words) in leading his own people through terrible conflict.  <p>Morris's stimulating and delightfully crafted quest for the ""true"" Lincoln commences with the funeral cortge in 1865, and promises visits to Lincoln sites from Sinking Springs to Ford's Theatre that will allow us to sharpen our judgment of the sixteenth president and of the impact of his reputation on the American mind. It is an ambitious itinerary for 208 pages. <p>In the modern Academy, historians make reputations by debunking legends, which, generally, they view as sinister Establishment conspiracies -- or myths, rather -- foisted on a nave public and, as such, disorders requiring professional ""reeducation"" as therapy. For the English, no more Churchillian beef! The Ameri-can counterpart: should the world's remaining superpower be weaned off ""Honest Abe?""<p>Legendary figures such as Lincoln (and Churchill) are different things, with different purposes and different roots, from their historical identities. Legends might instruct perceptive travelers about a foreign society; historians may destroy historical reputations through incisive professional research. Mixing the two will likely confound both purposes. Jan Morris, a resident of Wales and distinguished both as a travel writer and an historian, is awkwardly poised for her journey. <p>This book's easy and engaging style provides a smooth ride into the Civil War for those who know only the beginning and the ending; specialists are unlikely to be enlightened. There is some breadth in context, but necessarily little depth; Lincoln's Whiggery and the economic significance of the Kansas-Nebraska Act are touched upon, but backroom, political wheeling-dealing is glossed over and the southern slave-owning interests come across as Evelyn Waugh's <i>Brideshead</i> in brownshirts.<p>Though she is drawn to a complex and ambiguous admiration of her subject, Morris's evenhandedness with the sources suggests that that there is actually little mysterious about the historical Lincoln. ""My paramount object is to save the Union,"" Lincoln wrote to Horace Greeley, and from that frequently repeated objective we can trace the qualities that Churchill noted, for better -- defiance in the bleak years of 1861-62, and a promise of magnanimity and goodwill in victory -- and, arguably, for worse -- the resolution, that could fairly be termed ""fanaticism,"" to implement a Whig, statist imperium. Indeed, Lincoln was a fanatic like Churchill, capable (as most of us are) of discovering later the ethical imperative in long-held and self-serving desires.  <p>For Morris, however, this resolution is transformed by a moral change she sees him undergo during the War: in the Gettysburg Address, we read, he ""made up for"" earlier guile and deception with words reflecting his ""loyalty to his wife, his inexhaustible love for [his children], his pride of country, his sympathy for animals, his kind understanding of ordinary people."" That Morris is prepared to give Lincoln such benefit of the doubt here is not a result of disregarding evidence but, perhaps, of her desire to make the legend fit the facts.  <p>Morris the historian and Morris the travel writer unwittingly become Morris the therapist. Accordingly, she travels first class, as it were, and too purposefully to hear ordinary people on their own terms. Instead, we are presented with some disappointingly stereotypical natives: ""hugely bulbous"" white trash in modern Illinois, a boring small-town joker in a straw hat, and an ""I've seen it all"" cockney-like doorman in Washington, D.C. There is a wonderfully evocative description of contemporary Springfield, but why could we not have more criticism of the ""heritage"" monuments? There is a moving account of Lincoln's visit to Richmond in the last month of his life, but why not some meatier thoughts from the modern-day locals? <p>Finally, as one must expect nowadays from self-proclaimed iconoclasts, the contemporary comment is predictable: Lincoln, for example, is contrasted to the ""young zealots . . . urgently propagating their callow ideologies -- Mrs. Thatcher's disciples"" (how quickly some historians forget the real zealots). By way of conclusion, we are warned that, although Lincoln's aims were apparently purified by 1865, the conspiracy to ingrain into Americans ""a sense of privilege, so irritating to foreigners today, and the belief that the U.S.A. has the right -- the duty indeed -- to intervene in the affairs of other cultures, had its origins in Lincoln's victory."" There: so much for thinking the good guys won the Cold War!<p>In fact, as Morris acknowledges, the Lincoln legend, like that of Churchill, is fading. From where will the new legends come? The natural historical attachments of the English are being severed by a deeply ignorant, or careless, government; it seems that Americans are deterred from even forming such attachments by the continuing presence of powerful groups with money to make from grinding axes. Yet there is surely a wisdom, not a conspiracy, that lies behind the unsystematic historical affections of societies, and that such a book as this might have addressed. We should keep on searching for that wisdom because, as Churchill wrote (and Lincoln might have wished to have said): ""If we open a quarrel between the past and the present, we shall find that we have lost the future.""<p><i>Ian Crowe, editor of the newsletter of the London-based Edmund Burke Society, is founding director of the Edmund Burke Society of America.

1546	684870312		Where I'm Bound		Ballard, Allen B.			It was not until 1943, when Bell Irving Wiley published <i>The Life of Johnny Reb</i>, that the common soldier in the Civil War gained his voice. Although veterans on both sides of the conflict published reminiscences after the War, their memoirs lacked the perspective that only a scholar such as Wiley could give to place the voices of individual soldiers in a broader context. <p> The groundbreaking work on Johnny Reb was followed nine years later by Wiley's companion piece on Billy Yank. Since then, more than a dozen professional historians have attempted capture the voice of the common soldier. Regrettably, these works have been limited entirely to white soldiers because the largely illiterate African-American soldiers did not leave written records of their service. Although Joseph T. Glatthaar attempted to deal specifically with the black experience in <i>Forged in Battle</i>, even he was forced to dwell on the white officers who commanded these men rather than on black soldiers themselves. <p> Given the lack of primary source material, black soldiers will never gain their voice unless it is through a work of fiction. Fortunately, this void has now been filled by Allen B. Ballard, a teacher of African American history at the State University of New York at Albany. <p> <b>Where I'm Bound</b> follows the career of a black slave, Joe Duckett, who escapes his master, joins the Union army, and serves as a scout and non-commissioned officer in the 3rd Cavalry, United States Colored Troops. His story begins in June 1863, shortly after the battle of Milliken's Bend, and closes in early February 1865. The action takes place in north Louisiana and the Mississippi Delta, where Joe fights a private war involving guerrillas and bushwhackers, contrabands and slaves, soldiers and civilians. Other characters in Ballard's novel include Zenobia, Joe's wife; Betty, Joe's mistress; Richard Kenworthy, Joe's former master and a colonel in the Confederate Army; Sue, Kenworthy's wife; and Pauline, Kenworthy's black mistress. Joe's white company commander, William Stiles, completes the diverse cast of emotionally complex characters. <p> Although some characters in <b>Where I'm Bound</b> were inspired by real people and the events are drawn from a published history of a Union regiment of black cavalry, the reader may wonder whether Ballard has taken too many liberties with the record. For example, in one scene the author has Confederate soldiers using a pack of slave dogs to lead their charge. Despite Ballard's claim in an author's note that the incident actually occurred, the reader's credulity may be challenged by the melodramatic manner in which it is presented. <p> Pro-Confederate readers will most likely complain that Ballard has sensationalized the plight of the black soldier, while readers in sympathy with the circumstances of African-Americans during that period will applaud his honest depiction.  <p> But who knows what really happened? It is precisely because racial antagonisms permeated almost every aspect of the Civil War that we have no way today of determining just how nasty things got. <p> Partisan wrangling aside, readers will find <b>Where I'm Bound</b> to be a good read, a novel that gives voice to a group of men and women that has stood too long in the shadows cast by the War's more illustrious luminaries. It is about time that we listen. <p> <i>James G. Hollandsworth, Jr., is associate provost, professor of psychology, and lecturer in history at the University of Southern Mississippi.

4098			"โOld Buck"" and the Political Crisis of the 1850s"		Childers, Christopher			"James Buchanan has never enjoyed a good reputation among historians and president-raters; most people rate his presidency at or near the worst in American history.  Yet even as students of the 1850s note his shortcomings, manyโif not mostโof the scholars of this period qualify their answer.  For James Buchananโthe โOld Public Functionary""โpossessed perhaps the most experience of any president in our history.  Buchananโs rรฉsumรฉ reveals a man immersed in the American political system.  Congressman, senator, minister to the Court of St. James, minister to Russia, secretary of state; Buchanan held all these positions in a political career that spanned from the 1820s to the commencement of the Civil War.  By almost any measure, James Buchanan had sterling credentials for the office of president.</p>
<p>
Some of Americaโs most prominent historians have exhibited ambivalenceโat bestโabout the 15th president.  More often, Old Buck has faced withering criticism.  For example, Kenneth M. Stampp addressed Buchanan in two of his books: <i>And the War Came</i> (1950) and <i>America in 1857: A Nation on the Brink</i> (1990).  One of the northern Democratsโ most sympathetic historians, Roy F. Nichols, lauded Stampp for taking a โsensible view"" of Buchanan, โmaking him neither the villain nor the constitutional saint.""  Forty years later, however, even Stampp penned a scathing portrait of Buchanan.   In the 1950s and 1960s, historians like Nichols concerned themselves with offering a fair assessment of the โOld Public Functionary.""  Philip Shriver Kleinโs 1962 biography of Buchanan embodies this principle; nearly all its reviewers commented on the fair and impartial approach (in their estimation) of the book.  Klein offers the most sympathetic treatment of the 15th president.  However, Stamppโs latter portrait better characterizes the typical approach of recent Buchanan historiography.  Certainly Jean Bakerโs recent portrayal of Buchanan fits this view.</p>  
<p>
Last month, a panel of distinguished historians gathered in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, James Buchananโs hometown, to participate in a symposium on the man and the crises he faced during his presidency.  On the symposiumโs first night, participants assembled on the grounds of Buchananโs home, Wheatland, for a discussion between two of the greatest historians of the 1850sโMichael F. Holt and William Freehling.</p>  
<p>
Interestingly, the majority of the questions that Holt and Freehling fielded concerned counterfactualsโthe great โWhat Ifs?"" of history.  What if Buchanan had stuck with his earlier advocacy of extending the Missouri Compromise line rather than endorsing the Kansas-Nebraska Act?  What if Buchanan had asserted national authority in the Kansas imbroglio?  What if Buchanan had taken a stronger posture in the secession crisis?  The Buchanan presidency seems to provoke many โwhat if"" questions from people who cannot escape the conclusion that many things went terribly wrong between the years of 1857 and 1861.</p>
<p>
The next day, the symposium shifted to Franklin & Marshall College, where Buchanan served as president of the board of trustees from 1852 to 1866.  Old Buck certainly had a few sympathizers in the crowd; one man rose at the end of the last session to praise Buchanan, especially given the fact that he has endured ceaseless criticism for 150 years.  Few historical figures have endured such scrutiny and disdain, the man argued.  And yet, even the most ardent Buchanan supportersโfrom the Lancaster community and elsewhereโeventually concede that the presidentโs record certainly does not merit praise.  Of course, many of the panelists grappled with this very question. Buchanan biographer (and symposium participant) Jean Baker has phrased the dilemma well, asking โwhy such a well-trained and well-intentioned public figure could have failed so abominably""?</p>
<p>
Most all of the panelists agreed: James Buchananโs was a failed presidency.  And when someone spoke of his strengths, they surely did not speak of the sectional crisis.  John Belohlavek spoke positively of Buchananโs skill at managing foreign policy, while William B. MacKinnon praised his decisive efforts at ending the Mormon crisis in Utah.  But a strong foreign policy aimed at territorial expansion and the tamping down of rebellion in Utah did not assuage most of the scholars at this symposium, who generally viewed Old Buckโs presidency harshly.  Indeed, while other panelists conceded Belohlavekโs point, they noted that Buchanan tended to flee domestic crises by attending to foreign affairs.</p>
<p>
In all fairness, and in spite of Buchananโs obvious shortcomings, most of the historians agreed that Buchanan inherited a terrible situation.  As Nicole Etcheson pointed out, the crisis in Kansas had already spun out of control as proslavery and antislavery settlers in the territory made a mockery of Stephen Douglasโs popular sovereignty doctrine.  And as  Holt and Freehlingโtwo grey giants of the fieldโably discussed, the great party system that had given form and organization to political conflict was in disarray.  A sectional party had risen from the ashes of the Whig Party and the short-lived Know Nothings to challenge the Democrats.  And while the feckless Republican candidate John C. Fremont lost his bid for the presidency in 1856, the specter of a sectional party hostile to southern interests threatened political stability and provoked bitter recriminations from southern Democrats and northern doughfaces.</p>
<p>
Amidst this turmoil, James Buchanan won the presidency.  Yet the scholars at Lancaster generally agreed that Buchanan made a bad situation worse.  As Maury Klein noted, Buchanan picked an ineffective cabinet.  Secretary of State Lewis Cass had long passed his prime and served as a mere figurehead; John B. Floyd, the Secretary of War, appeared downright crooked, especially after a congressional investigation severely tarnished the Buchanan administrationโs image.  At the outset of his presidency, Buchanan had tried to craft a sectionally balanced Cabinet and in the end created a mess.  Perhaps more notably, Buchananโs meddling in the Dred Scott case created a firestorm in the North at the very beginning of his presidency.  The presidentโs statement that he would โcheerfully submit"" to the Supreme Courtโs decision in the case followed a brief conference between Buchanan and Chief Justice Roger B. Taney moments before he took the oath of office.  But this paled in comparison to allegations that Buchanan had personally encouraged his friend Justice Robert C. Grier to vote with the majority and deny Scottโs plea.  Legal historian Paul Finkelman presented a compelling argument that Buchananโs early actions immediately handicapped his administration.</p>
<p>
By 1860, old battles over Kansas, the Dred Scott decision, and internecine struggles within the Democratic Party had weakened the American political establishment and had rendered the Buchanan administration ineffective.  When Abraham Lincoln won election to the presidency in November 1860, without a single electoral vote from the South, a crisis had finally emerged that compromise would not avert.  But Buchanan faced his own crisis, in what Jean Baker has called his โextraordinary contradiction"" that while Buchanan believed the Union inviolable, โhe held no coercive power to prevent or overturn an illegal act by a state.""  Buchananโs belief that he possessed no power to maintain the Union paralyzed his administration and seemingly limited him to a wait-and-see approach, hoping that calmer heads would prevail and the crisis would pass.  Jean Baker, Daniel Crofts, and Michael Holt discussed Buchananโs actions in the secession crisis, a course that strongly favored the South.  Buchanan seemed increasingly impotent in addressing the issues that the crisis posed and even acquiescent in the course of secession, to the point where he prepared to order Major Robert Anderson from Fort Sumter back to the scuttled Fort Moultrie, a move that essentially surrendered the federal installations in South Carolina.  Only when three of Buchananโs cabinet members threatened resignation did Buchanan change his course and take a more Unionist stance.  In many respects, Buchanan seemed all too willing to leave the crisis for Lincoln to manage.</p>
<p>
Buchanan left the presidency in disgrace, and ever since historians have damned his administration for its ineptitude and ineffectiveness.  Why then hold a symposium on the fifteenth president?  In contrast, we certainly will not see symposiums on Warren G. Hardingโthe runner-up to Buchanan as Americaโs worst president in a recent <i>U.S. News</i> surveyโany time soon!  Each historian at this conference answered this question definitively.  While the Buchanan presidency surely failed, no one can doubt the import of his presidential years.  He presided over a nation in turmoil, on the brink of the most celebrated and well-studied event in U.S. history, the Civil War.  Yet as more than one scholar at this symposium argued, Buchanan was the wrong president at the wrong time.  Sterling credentials aside, Buchanan lacked the ability to deal with the issues he faced.  That makes his presidency a failure, but it makes study of the presidency of James Buchanan essential.</p>

1544	385334052		A Still Small Voice		Reed, John			"John Reed's first novel, <b>A Still Small Voice</b>, is told as a memoir of Alma Flynt, an orphan girl who is taken in by her Aunt Bettina in Kentucky, just prior to the War. Alma learns herb and root healing from her aunt and falls in love with John Warren Cleveland, the younger son of the neighboring Cleveland family, and the story follows them through the Civil War and its hardships.  <p> Reed's style is rich and vivid, yet perhaps a bit too effulgent. Although Alma is charming precisely because she is precocious and original, the self-conscious style often strains too hard at its own figures. For example, Alma frets at the lack of letters during her wartime separation from John Warren: <p> <i>And it was a needle in my body - that want. But I imagined the past was a similar pain in my soldier. I thought of that needle not as a sewing needle, but as a compass needle. . . . </i><p><i> It was the needle of a compass - set free to cut in our bodies. And why did he not write? Why did we not find each other? Because the needle did not point from him to me, or me to him - but just north.</i> <p> This metaphor transforms itself from a needle that stabs to compass needle to something like a blade. The last sentence here almost sounds like an attempt to invoke John Donne's geometric compass (""A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning""), but it is not developed. Finally, this compass needle always points north, and we are left to guess what it could possibly signify in such a context. <p> And Alma and John Warren are like no children we have ever seen. We are surprised at the love-at-first-sight relationship between them, and their first kiss of passion at ages 8 and 11, respectively: "". . . our breath intermingled - and then our lips met, as delicately as the wings of butterflies in violets."" Even when we take into account that the narrator Alma, as an old woman, is giving us an idealized and romanticized reading of her memory, we are a little skeptical of the high poetic splendor of their fairy-tale romance. <p> The reader may also be puzzled by historical gaps, such as why no mention is made of the  Confederate invasion of central Kentucky by Braxton Bragg and Edmund Kirby Smith in the  summer and fall of 1862, which should have barged right through the Bluegrass country where the children's homes are located. Besides, the bulk of Kentucky was occupied by Union troops early in the War and, with the exception of Bragg's invasion and John Hunt Morgan's raids later in the War, was largely untouched by Confederate operations.  <p> The Union occupation, therefore, was largely a peaceful one. In this light, the devastation dealt out to the Cleveland family seems too much. Also, the wearing of sweaters by Kentucky gentlemen, the playing of croquet, the use of kerosene, Santa Claus, fresh fruit in May when Aunt Bettina dies, and the presence of coyotes in Kentucky in 1862 may be minor anachronisms, but they are jarring nonetheless. <p> <b>A Still Small Voice</b> has discernable power, however. One of the best passages of its kind in Civil War fiction is found in the scripture battle over slavery between Aunt Bettina and Mrs. Esterbrook. A desperate rescue later in the novel, when Aunt Bettina carries John Warren and Alma across the raging stream during a storm to save their lives, is truly magnificent. <p> John Reed's instincts are good, and we look forward to seeing more of his lyrical and distinctive style better deployed in future works. <p> <i>Randal Allred is associate professor of English and teaches writing and American literature at Brigham Young University-Hawaii. He has recently published articles on battle reenacting and on Stephen Crane, and is working on a book on writing the Civil War in American fiction.</i>"	Allred, Randal W.

1889	865546789		Griswoldville		Bragg, William Harris			Judging by the total number of troops involved (no more than 4,000), the casualties for both sides (fewer than 700), and its strategic significance (none at all), the clash that took place near Griswoldville, Georgia, in November 1864 was not a battle, but merely a minor engagement. <p> Yet Griswoldville is one of the most written-about military actions of the entire Civil War. The reason for this is threefold. First, it was the sole sizeable infantry encounter throughout the course of Sherman's march from Atlanta to the Atlantic in fall 1864. Second, it saw 1,500 Union troops repulse an attack by 2,400 Confederates, suffering in the process only 62 casualties while inflicting close to 600. Third, the Confederate force consisted almost entirely of Georgia militia - boys and old men - fighting for the first time, whereas the veteran Federal troops had become skilled killers on the bloody battlefields of Tennessee, Mississippi, and Georgia. Thus the one-sided slaughter at Griswoldville embodies, more than any other event of the War, the desperate courage of a South striving to save a cause already lost. <p> Disappointingly, <b>Griswoldville</b> fails to do full justice to the engagement's tragedy because it neglects to place it in the context of the Civil War's final phase. Instead, the initial two-thirds of the book is devoted to recounting such events as how the now-extinct village that lent its name to the battle came into existence, the transformation of its cotton gin factory into a wartime manufacturer of revolvers, and the futile attempt by Union cavalry raiders in July 1864 to liberate prisoners at the nearby town of Macon. Not until page 95 - and the text ends on page 155 - does a description of what happened at Griswoldville on November 22, 1864, begin. Even then there is no attempt, beyond the facts presented and documents quoted, to evoke the twilight of the Confederacy as the night of defeat descended upon it. <p> However a book should be judged for what it is, not for what one wishes it to be. On that basis, it is the best account of the engagement at Griswoldville ever published and should long remain so, based on its exhaustive research, intelligent interpretations, and clear writing. The text is enhanced by a superabundance of maps and illustrations, some of which appear here for the first time. My only suggestions to the author, who has written extensively about the history of the Civil War in his native Georgia, involve minor technical considerations. If there is a second printing of the book, he might consider repositioning the map on page 76, recaptioning the portrait of Sherman on page 83, and providing specific documentation for his assertions that the Union troops at Griswoldville were armed mainly with Spencer repeating rifles (these were not standard infantry issue in Sherman's army).  <p> <i>Albert Castel, a retired professor of history, is the author of more than ten books about the Civil War, including the prize-winning</i> Decision in the West: The Atlanta Campaign of 1864 (1992). <i>His latest, Tom Taylor's Civil War, was published in November.</i>	Castel, Albert	Winter 2001	2000-12-01	Review	Griswoldville's lopsided outcome signaled the Confederacy's end	'Desperate courage'	Mercer University Press	36586				"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=227 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/BraggGriswoldville.jpg"">"

The influx of immigrants into northern states and the concomitant rise of the Republican Party, which drew its support almost exclusively from north of the Mason-Dixon, cracked the ""Slave Power"" in Congress---and the 1860-61 secession of southern states crumbled it forever."

1626	188384651X		The Firing on Fort Sumter: A Splintered Nation Goes to War		Colbert, Nancy A.			"Major Robert Anderson, USA, has achieved the unenviable position of opening civil war,"" shouted the headlines. The <i>Charleston Courier</i> interpreted Anderson's removal of federal troops in December 1860 from Fort Moultrie to Fort Sumter as hostile. His move, even though ""under cloak of night,"" was, in fact, Anderson's attempt to maintain peace, as Charlestonians were becoming increasingly unfriendly. The major's albatross was his vague order from Washington: avoid confrontation; defend the fort. But Moultrie wasn't defendable! <p> For any rendering of an historical event to satisfy an audience, the author must organize, summarize, and communicate the Big Picture - including the conditions preceding and influencing the specific event - in this case, the eventual surrender of Sumter. Nancy Colbert adheres to these guidelines in <b>The Firing on Fort Sumter</b>. Skillfully leading us into the midst of chaos (misdirected orders, undelivered requests, misinterpreted events), Colbert sets the stage well. She baits the hook in the first chapter by introducing the men of Moultrie, specifically Anderson, who is forced to make heroic choices by himself. These are the enlisted men and officers who will hold their position until starved and burned out, finally using their <i>socks</i> for cartridge bags. Introduced, too, are the forts that become pawns between patriots and statriots. <p> In the second chapter, Colbert relates the preceding events, depicting James Buchanan as an out-of-political-shape president eager to pass the reins to Lincoln. Shifting again in the chapters that follow, Colbert returns to the harbor where the drama unfolds, patching us back and forth between the players who orchestrate the pageantry. Portraits of these characters are included. Since readers' appetites may be whetted, as well, for detailed photos of the fortresses, a ""trip to the library"" may be an indirect bonus of this book. One cannot help but wonder about the condition of Moultrie, which after years of wind and wave now rests so far down in the sand dunes that grazing cows accidentally fall inside, and of Sumter, unfinished when Anderson first moved in and slapped together by its new in-habitants, only to be rubbled by cannon fire.  <p> Colbert's first book,  <i>Lou Henry Hoover</i> was reviewed as thorough but sometimes lackluster. <b>The Firing on Fort Sumter</b> does not lack luster. It is organized (with index, glossary, references), expansive, and, more importantly, gives a feel for the soldiers who waited while politicians, citizens, secessionists, anti-secessionists, and profiteers made up their minds about war.  <p> It is fitting that Colbert closes with Anderson's celebrated repossession of Fort Sumter exactly four years after he surrendered it. It's discomfiting, however, to learn that Lincoln was invited to attend but already had tickets to Ford's Theatre. Appropriate for a young adult audience, these pages offer much to fire a discussion, splintered or not.  <p> <i>Mary Bahr Fritts, author of</i> If Nathan Were Here<i> (2000) and</i> The Memory Box<i> (1995), has written more than 150 stories and articles.

1886	807125873		Sir Henry Morton Stanley, Confederate		Hughes, Nathaniel C.			Many volunteers from the British Isles, whatever their motives, took sides in the American Civil War. One of these was Henry Morton Stanley, who became famous largely as a result of his later adventures in Africa, and the books he wrote about the Dark Continent. He chronicled his wartime experiences as well, which editor Nathaniel Cheairs Hughes, Jr., has culled from Stanley's Autobiography (1909) to present in <b>Sir Henry Morton Stanley, Confederate.</b> <p> Stanley, Welsh-born and American-adopted, was originally a journalist working for a New York paper, but he truly made his mark after meeting David Livingstone at Lake Tanganyka in 1871. This autobiography, however, relates how he came to be a soldier in the Confederate army, and then a sailor in the Federal navy later in the Civil War.  <p> The account begins by describing how an illegitimate and unloved child grew into a young man who worked his passage to New Orleans. There he met Henry Hope Stanley, who eventually adopted him. He had left home to make his own way in the world. Just prior to secession, we find Stanley working in a general store at Cypress Bend, Arkansas, on the Arkansas River, where he learns to deal with the rough and touchy characters that he meets first in his everyday life, and then later in the army. <p> Most of the autobiography concerns itself either with Stanley's early career or with the writer's experiences in the War Between the States. He writes with the benefit of hindsight, many years after the events described, but the narrative shows clearly the way that his mind and attitudes were shaped by the War. <p> The descriptions he gives of the rigors of the campaign, the lack of care generally shown the private soldier, and the horrors of Shiloh, as well as Stanley's capture and subsequent treatment at Camp Douglas in Illinois, enable one better to understand the trials he faced. After reading the description of the prison camp's disease and neglect, Stanley's decision to accept an offer of freedom on condition he joined the Federal artillery becomes understandable. The account ends in August 1862, although Stanley's wartime experience did not.  <p> Hughes has edited Stanley's prose into a very readable book that Civil War buffs should find of great interest. One or two maps to illustrate the progress of the 6th Arkansas, in which Private Stanley served, would have been helpful. Nevertheless thoroughly recommended. <p> <i>Alec Hasenson, M.D., is author of </i>The Golden Arrow <i>(1970) and</i> The History of Dover Harbour <i>(1980).</i>	Hasenson, Alec	Winter 2001	2000-12-01	Review	An intrepid British adventurer soldiered for both sides	'Private Stanley, I presume?'

3308	375503153	$27.95 hardcover	Bleeding Blue and Gray: Civil War Surgery and the Evolution of American Medicine		Rutkow, M.D., Ira M.			Military medicine<br>Hospitals shaped the creation of a public health system<p>The American Civil War is one of the most widely written about periods of America's history. The combat, suffering, and death are glorified through the written accounts of the participants and historians. Yet, as the author states in the Preface, if a description of armed conflict is ever to be considered faithful, then the brutality of combat as well as the painful physical and mental restoration of maimed bodies should be spoken of. The reader must gain a surgeon's perspective of the aggression of war.</p><p>Author Ira M. Rutkow accomplishes this in his latest book, <b>Bleeding Blue and Gray</b>. Dr. Rutkow is a clinical professor of surgery at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. He holds a doctorate of public health from Johns Hopkins University and is the author of three previously published books on the history of surgery. In his new book, he focuses on the medical care in the North because there was no great difference in the practice of medicine between the North and South, the preponderance of existing military medical records pertains to the Northern armies, and the institutions that most affected the maturation of American medicine following the Civil War were largely outgrowths of Northern military medicine.</p><p>The author takes us from the dismal beginnings of the North's attempt to provide medical care in 1861 to the unprecedented system of evacuation, treatment, and convalescence that emerged by the end of the conflict. The U.S. Army Medical Department, led in the beginning of the war by totally inept and ossified Surgeon Generals, was not at all prepared for the hundreds and thousands of sick and wounded soldiers that they had to care for. Gradually, through the farsightedness and leadership of such people as Jonathan Letterman, Medical Director of the Army of the Potomac, and Surgeon General William A. Hammond, the North developed a system of medical care that was copied by armies around the world into World War I. Letterman's ambulance corps, evacuation and hospital systems saved thousands of lives and are the basis of the system used in today's conflicts. Hammond's innovations led to the first published American medical work recognized by the European medical community, <i>The Medical and Surgical History of the War of the Rebellion</i>. He initiated the Army Medical Museum, the Surgeon General's Library, and many other projects that were completed after his tenure as head of the Army Medical Department.</p><p>This volume also delves into the origin and development of the United States Sanitary Commission without whose existence thousands and thousands of sick and wounded would have suffered even more.  More than one Union doctor had stated that if it were not for the Sanitary Commission, the soldiers not would have received the medicines, foods, and other supplies in a timely manner.</p><p>The author also discusses the tumultuous relationship between Surgeon General Hammond and Secretary of War Edwin Stanton (which eventually led to Hammond's demise), the nursing situation, and the efforts of both civilian and military personnel to improve the Army's medical department.</p><p>Dr. Rutkow names three advancements that resulted from the Civil War: the start of specialty hospitals, specialized skills within the field of surgery as a prerequisite to formal recognition of proficiency, and beginnings of the public health system in the United States.</p><p><b>Bleeding Blue and Gray</b> is exceptionally well written, easy to read, and very educational. The author is able to weave the various topics in this subject matter into a cohesive volume that should be in the library of every person interested in Civil War medicine. On a scale of one to ten, this reviewer gives this book a rating of 8.75 scalpels.</p><p><i>Peter J.

2153	809322935		At Lincoln's Side: John Hay's Civil War Correspondence and Selected Writings		Burlingame, Michael	Hay, John		"Modern White House staffers are far removed from their original role as ""passionate anonyms."" Today they wield power once reserved for cabinet secretaries. Simultaneously, the number of employees in the White House has expanded from a handful during Lincoln's administration to several hundred. Yet some White House staff characteristics have not changed. Lincoln's ""secretaries"" were young; today's White House employees tend to be young. Supporting the president is still the essential purpose of staff, although nowadays support of the First Lady is just as needed. Conflicts between Mary Todd Lincoln and her husband's staff foreshadowed the role that First Ladies now enjoy. <p> Civil War correspondence not destroyed by John Hay as well as several selections from his other writings are contained in <b>At Lincoln's Side</b>. From that material, some of which has previously appeared in print, emerges a sketch of Abraham Lincoln and John Milton Hay (1838-1905). Hay comes across as a bit of a romantic who does not enjoy politics and who tends toward extreme judgments. He comes to identify with Lincoln, and, consistent with Hay's exaggerated tendencies, eventually reveres the president as the ""greatest character since Christ."" Yet Hay worked hard and became more diplomatic through experiencing the political world. Lincoln is pictured as a democratic leader firmly in charge of his administration. Mutual respect between the two somewhat poetic characters is evident. <p> The work also contains two appendices with articles by editor Michl Burlingame on ""The Authorship of the Bixby Letter"" and ""Mary Todd Lincoln's Unethical Conduct as First Lady."" Burlingame, who states in the introduction that ""it is impossible to identify precisely"" what Hay wrote for Lincoln but that ""informed guesses can be made,"" deems the Bixby letter the work of Hay rather than Lincoln. <p> There is always the danger of staff coming to believe they are more important than the elected leader they assist. The second appendix, on Mary Todd Lincoln, presumably is included to justify Hay's dislike of the First Lady, even though the tone of Hay's letters seems to become less critical of her over time. Mary Todd Lincoln needs to be placed in the broader perspective of an individual who never intended to become an invalid First Lady and who was as determined as her male contemporaries to achieve her ends. <p> The placement of the editor's numerous and often helpful notes at the end of the book makes reading tedious. This is not a book for general readership, but it will be useful in Lincoln collections. <p> <i>William D. Pederson is the American Studies Chair and director of the International Lincoln Center at Louisiana State University in Shreveport.

2109	817309624		The Confederate Home Front: Montgomery During the Civil War	Confederate Home Front: Montgomery During the Civil War The	Rogers Jr., William Warren			Montgomery, Alabama -- the first capital of the Confederate States of America, as well as the capital of the state -- is an interesting example of a fairly major Southern city during the American   Civil War. <p>The populace was about evenly divided racially: half white and half black. There were 8,843 residents on the eve of the war; about 100 of the blacks were free, and they lived on the periphery of the town. We can be sure that the vast mass of the blacks hoped for Northern victory, but the vast mass of whites (with a few notable exceptions) were fiercely pro-Confederate. <p>The people suffered mightily as a result of the conflict, but their city was spared destruction. Federal troops did not operate near it until the end, when James Harrison Wilson's raiders accepted surrender without resistance. William Warren Rogers has done a commendable job of thoroughly researching the city and life therein, 1861-1865, and has written a pleasing and quite readable account which should have wide appeal.<p>Rogers has keenly studied other cities as well as Montgomery, and occasionally interpolates from known elements in one, in order to make strong plausible suggestions about the Alabama capital. He has scoured through all the necessary sources to adequately underpin his scholarship and has provided a number of good photographs as well. No major errors and very few minor ones were detected by this reviewer. Indeed, it seems that this book could serve not only for enjoyable and informative reading, but also as a reference tool for scholars.<p>While the Confederacy was predominantly rural, its cities were of vital importance. Montgomery provided a lot of matriel and personnel for the war effort. This city was especially significant for its business and factories, its hospitals, its storage facilities, and its transportation linkages: it was served by both rail and water-borne traffic. <p>Montgomery was not quite adequate in facilities to suit its being retained as the Confederate capital, but its location was a lot better for defense than was Richmond to where the government was relocated soon after Virginia's secession. The people of Montgomery constitute a most illustrative and informative case study of a Southern community during the war.<p>It is striking to learn how much interaction there was between whites and blacks. The public places were open to both (albeit in the theater there was segregated seating, for example). Slaves as well as free blacks enjoyed horse races, and frequently bet on them too. Urban blacks tended to enjoy a visibly better standard of living than did rural blacks, regardless of whether they were slave or free. At Christmas time, most of the whites felt too beleaguered to do much celebrating or to wear finery, but this was not the case with blacks, who made much merriment. <p>Despite the undeniable heavy impact of the war, in a great many respects life went on as usual. Schools continued to operate, and indeed, they proliferated. Several of them converted to military institutions -- giving good and sound instruction in drill and other martial qualities. Business thrived. The fire and police departments provided much-needed services. Public welfare agencies sprang into being. Formal arrangements for the care of orphaned children were engendered. Artificial limbs were manufactured in great numbers. New inventions were devised. Prostitution and public amusements of a less sinful nature continued unabated. The populace spent much time at the newspaper and telegraph offices, where notices of the war's ongoing progress -- and of the ultimate Confederate disaster -- were regularly posted.<p>Montgomery had been a prosperous place before the war, but the conflict wrought a great degree of change. Life changed most of all for the blacks and for the small minority of whites whose lifestyles had depended upon their ownership. Montgomery would become a prosperous place again, but not at first, and indeed not for quite a few years. The most lasting effects of the war upon residents were psychological, emotional, and soul-searing: those folks who benefitted, benefitted mightily; those folk who lost, lost something that their progeny still struggle to understand and to accept.<p><i>Herman Hattaway is co-editor of the </i>Shades of Blue and Gray Series<i> published by the University of Missouri Press.</i>	Hattaway, Herman	Summer 1999	1999-06-01	Review	Montgomery survived the war with surprising ease	Capital struggles	University of Alabama Press	0000-00-00				"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=241 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/RogersConfHomeFrontMont.jpg"">"

1861	1882810473		The Civil War in Kentucky: Battle for the Bluegrass State		Brown, Kent Masterson			"More than 70 years have passed since a book has appeared that addresses Kentucky's role in the Civil War and its own internal conflict in the detail that the complexity of the twin issues requires. It cannot be for a lack of drama; nearly everyone who writes on the topic quotes Lincoln about the importance of Kentucky to the ultimate success of the Union cause. Lowell Harrison's 1976 volume on Kentucky during the Civil War was too restricted in length (by the series of which it was part) to do full justice to the topic. Kent Masterson Brown's collection of essays, <b>The Civil War in Kentucky</b>, might appear to suggest by its title that it seeks to fill this long-standing need in the literature, but it is not a comprehensive account of Kentucky during the War. Rather it is an interesting and very useful collection of essays. <p> Brown, an attorney, is the author of <i>Cushing of Gettysburg: The Story of a Union Artillery Commander</i> and a number of articles. For some years he served as chair of the Perryville Battlefield Commission and of the Gettysburg National Military Park Advisory Commission. <p> Like all anthologies, the essays are of varying strength and quality. In this case, however, there is less repetition and overlap among the essays than one might expect. <b>The Civil War in Kentucky</b> leads with its strongest and most interesting essay, John Y. Simon's ""Lincoln, Grant, and Kentucky."" Gracefully written, as one familiar with Simon's work would expect, deeply grounded in primary sources, and imaginative and insightful, Simon's essay is a masterpiece. Lowell Harrison also does a very fine job in his ""The Government of Confederate Kentucky."" These two essays are welcome additions to the literature by scholars who have a deep familiarity with the sources and the larger context for their topics. <p>  The largest subgroup of essays focuses on the major battles fought in Kentucky - Mill Springs, Richmond, Munfordville, and Perryville - and are well-written, narrative accounts by individuals thoroughly familiar with their topic. They will each serve well as short overviews of major actions. Essays on John Hunt Morgan and the Orphan Brigade bring those very familiar aspects of the war in Kentucky into the collection. <p> Unfortunately, large areas of Kentucky's experience during the Civil War and a number of important actions and sites are omitted. The topics selected reflect a very traditional approach to the study of the War and little of the concerns of newer scholarship on the home front, African Americans, or women, for example. The collection would have been stronger had an essay addressing Kentucky African Americans and their experience during the War been included. Kentucky, by the official count, which is probably substantially low, contributed the second-largest number of African-American troops to the Union army, and Camp Nelson in Jessamine County was a major recruitment and training center for U.S. Colored Troops. Also, essays dealing with relations between the Union army in Kentucky and the people of Kentucky, and one on the far western area of the Commonwealth, might have further augmented the collection. <p> As an introduction to its subject, <b>The Civil War in Kentucky</b> would make a worthy addition to any library. Well-illustrated, it also has maps that are useful especially in the chapters dealing with the battles. While not exactly as comprehensive as the title suggests, it is a welcome addition to the literature. <p> <i>William H.

2230	807122491		Nat Turner Before the Bar of Judgment: Fictional Treatments of the Southampton Slave Insurrection	Nat Turner Before the Bar of Judgment: Fictional Treatments of the Southampton Slave Insurrection	Davis, Mary Kemp			"Nat Turner was hanged 30 years before the firing on Fort Sumter, but the slave rebellion that bears his name helped bring on the Civil War. <p>In the course of a two-day rampage in August 1831, Turner and a band of fellow blacks, both free and slave, killed 55 whites in Southampton County, Virginia, many of them women and children. The rebellion was quickly put down, vigilantes killed several hundred blacks in reprisal, and many of those who took part in the uprising were quickly tried and executed. But the legacy of America's most sustained and successful slave revolt was profound.<p>The Virginia legislature, which had edged towards debate over emancipation, instead clamped down on both free and enslaved blacks with a series of harsh measures restricting the movement and education of African Americans. And the general terror caused by Nat Turner's revolt hardened attitudes and anti-slave measures across the South.<p>The revolt also energized Northern abolitionists, offering proof that blacks desperately desired their own freedom and would fight and die for it. In the decades that followed, figures such as John Brown, Frederick Douglass, and Harriet Beecher Stowe would look to Nat Turner as an inspiration in the fight to end America's ""peculiar institution."" Nor did Turner's legacy end with the Civil War. He has remained a touchstone for debate about the legitimacy of violence and the nation's continuing struggle to understand and make amends for slavery.<p>It is therefore fitting that Mary Kemp Davis looks at Nat Turner not so much as a historical figure, but as a cultural symbol whose meaning has changed in the 168 years since the Southampton insurrection. We know very little about Turner himself, and given the scarcity of sources beyond the trial records and Turner's ""confession,"" we may never know for sure whether he masterminded the rebellion or if there was a wider conspiracy. <p>These ""lacun in the historical record"" have only added to Turner's potency, allowing Americans to see in him what they want. Is he a freedom fighter or homicidal madman? A bold man of action or the tortured spiritualist of William Styron's novel <i>The Confessions of Nat Turner</i>? A man who helped blacks gain their freedom, or one whose actions only tightened the chains of enslavement?<p>An English professor at Florida A & M University, Davis weaves together history and literary criticism as she examines Turner's portrayal in a number of texts, from contemporaneous accounts to Styron's acclaimed and controversial novel published in 1967. For readers interested in the rebellion and its murky history, the first 75 pages of Davis's book are a valuable contribution, a lucid and discerning survey of the various sources and their reliability, or lack thereof. She shows that the traditional view of Turner as a charismatic religious ""madman"" who led a localized uprising is only one of several possibilities that can be deduced from the slim and often contradictory historical record. Curiously, the trials of a number of other co-conspirators before Turner's capture make little mention of him, nor do they highlight his spiritualism. And inadequate attention has been paid to the abolitionist ferment against which Turner's revolt played out.<p>This reader, however, found much of the rest of Davis's book hard going. Several of the fictional works she treats are obscure, and she provides little reason why they should be rediscovered. More problematic is the dense theoretical language infusing Davis's work, which is filled with words like ""praxis,"" ""overdetermined,"" and ""dialogically,"" and sentences such as: ""The 'Fragment of a memory' in Styron's Confessions is hieroglyphic and encoded. It creates multiple signifying texts that issue a 'call' for a signifying response."" <p>Davis's work is nonetheless a provocative re-examination of Turner and the long shadow he has cast. The author's central thesis is that ""Nat Turner has been rearraigned, retried, and resentenced many times during the last century and a half."" By raising and exploring key questions about our understanding of Turner, Davis insures that he will indeed continue to be retried, and that, like the Civil War, the Southampton slave uprising will be an event that each generation must examine and interpret by its own light.<p><i>Tony Horwitz is author of</i> Confederates in the Attic."

1525	684857626		The Other Side: A Novel of the Civil War		McColley, Kevin			"Observing Adolf Eichmann in a Jerusalem courtroom, Hannah Arendt struggled to give expression to the magnitude of evil perpetrated by the undistinguished ex-Nazi bureaucrat sitting in the defendant's box, charged with calmly overseeing the extermination of several million humans. ""The banality of evil,"" she famously termed Eichmann's ruthless bureaucratic efficiency. Eichmann's defense consisted of the claim that he was merely following orders, from which disobedience would have cost him his own life. He was, he insisted, a victim himself. ""I am not the monster that I am made out to be,"" Eichmann declared in a final plea for mercy.<p>The violence depicted in Kevin McColley's new novel, <b>The Other Side</b>, is from another war, in another century, on another continent. The wartime bloodletting that occurs in the Missouri and Kansas territories admittedly lacks the systematic rigor of Eichmann's program; it is arbitrary, gratuitous, and meaningless. The victims number only in the thousands. But a kind of appalling banality also typifies it, residing not only in the average people who organize themselves into bands of jayhawkers and bushwhackers but also in the casual indifference with which they murder their neighbors. The guerrillas' motivations vary: revenge, booty, escape from the strictures of society. To the last man, they have forgotten what it means to be human, and their survival comes at the price of their humanity. They are monsters, although it is less clear how they became such. <p>Through teenager Jacob Wilson, McColley chronicles the education of one bushwhacker and conveys the sheer ordinariness that marked his evolution into a killer. The novel opens on the eve of Ft. Sumter, with Jacob on his parents' Ohio riverfront farm, across from the slave state of Kentucky. Unreflective and unaware, he is only vaguely conscious of the gathering political storm. Seventeen years old, he thinks instead about a neighboring girl named Mary, and her likely role in ""a future he felt chained to"" but to which he nevertheless is resigned. His mother, Clara, is a Calvinist fatalist whose religious beliefs support the abolitionist cause; his father, Cyrus, is a practical man who urges Jacob to think critically. <p><b>Simple existence unravels</b><p>The Wilsons' simple existence unravels when they agree to harbor two runaway slaves -- a father named Isaac and his daughter, Sarah -- from Kentucky. Isaac and Sarah have fled a plantation owned by Henry Clay's son, and, when told by Jacob that he does not ""talk like no slave,"" an educated Isaac retorts: ""I have been to London. I have seen Shakespeare performed, and I have read Chaucer. How do you suggest I speak?"" <p>Cyrus abruptly enlists and departs to join McClellan's army, leaving Jacob and Clara to tend the farm and protect Isaac and Sarah. But a racist local blacksmith named Everett McGown has secured his own commission from the Union, and arrives at the Wilson farmstead with a military detachment to arrest the fugitive slaves, serving as an agent of Lincoln's appeasement of border states like Kentucky. Although McGown's goal is frustrated, Jacob has fallen in love with Sarah and resents the vulgar McGown's criminality. After Jacob, in a fit of fury, uses an axe to kill McGown, he abandons his mother and flees to Kentucky. <p>Jacob is pursued by awareness that he is a killer, a fate that leaves him restless for a sanctuary from his memory. He finds work as an attendant in a Kentucky brothel, but is soon driven west to Missouri. He stops temporarily in Osceola, where he is employed at a dry goods store owned by a unionist. Ironically, the store's owner is maimed during a raid by Federal cavalrymen who are bent on punishing Osceola for its southern sympathies. When the town is torched, Jacob resumes the peripatetic routine that characterizes the remainder of the novel.<p>Jacob befriends William ""Bloody Bill"" Anderson in Missouri and joins up with William Quantrill's bushwhackers. It is worth noting that Jacob remains indifferent to politics, and evinces no concern -- or, actually, consciousness -- about fighting on the opposite side from his father. In a way, though, his affiliation with the guerrillas proves especially apt because the bushwhackers (and their counterparts, the pro-Union jayhawkers) are not ideological so much as thuggish. In peacetime, Quantrill's men would be condemned as rogues, but war has bestowed ideological purpose on their criminality.<p><b>Theology laden with contradictions</b><p>Consumed by a recurrent specter that induces him to violence, Jacob grapples with the question of God's existence but cannot overcome a belief that theology is laden with contradictions: ""God is God of love and beauty and brother for brother and war and death and murder and blood and blood-soaked screams, of hands clasping in friendship and rising in anger, of souls born into this world and of souls fleeing from it and soulless eyes closing forever,"" he reasons. He offers an Old Testament interpretation of the capricious killing in which he participates, but never acknowledges the possibility of redemption. A deformed teenager named Haywood Lee (""Yes sirree, just like the general!"") introduces something of a Christian fool to the plot, although he fails to shake Jacob's fatalism. When, for example, Jacob instinctively shoots a young boy who chances upon the bushwhackers, one companion justifies it by noting, ""Ain't no Southerners allowed in this county no more."" But Haywood dryly adds, ""There ain't no Yankees allowed neither.""  <p>For the next 200 pages, the exploits and atrocities of Quantrill's men are recounted. Whatever the high-toned rhetoric of the war to the east, wanton destruction characterizes the  bushwhackers' tear across the plains. After a raid on Lawrence, Kansas, the novel describes how ""the war took its ugliest turn, scalped men, ears and noses and eyes and fingers as trophies, like for like with each like a little closer to the truth of what we are capable of."" <p>Although Jacob had once declared, ""There's something wrong with a fellow who takes pleasure"" in killing, he grows to embrace it as ordinary. Confronted with ethical dilemmas, he professes not to care. ""Makes no difference to me,"" he usually remarks. Bill Anderson, Jacob's closest comrade, tallies the men he has killed by tying a knot for each in a rope, and later begins collecting their scalps. Still, he confides in Jacob that he once had doubt about killing, but that the guilt dissipated as his killing become habitual. His heart has grown callous toward violence. ""It feels that way to me,"" Bloody Bill insists. ""Or I'd like it to, anyway.""  <p><b>The Other Side</b>'s anti-heroic depiction of war reaches a climax in page-long summary of atrocities in which Jacob participates, indifferent to their morality, ""numb"" to their evil. ""He was a boy who had murdered horribly, cowering within himself numbly like a boy, closing his eyes to his actions, closing his ears to the cries he had wrung from his victims,"" McColley writes. ""He was still only twenty."" Yet the novel is not a sentimental lament for lost innocence; it is a reminder of the banality of evil and the capacity of ordinary people to kill mechanically. But, like Eichmann, the bushwhackers are conscious of what they are doing; some monsters are self-constructed.<p>In Jacob we have a boy who grew to adulthood without ever developing his own character. From beginning to end he has deftly accommodated himself to changing circumstances, from sheltering runaway slaves to fighting alongside secessionists. Like his undefined politics, his sexual outlets are transient and shifting. Jacob survives but without gaining maturity.<p>The grand principles that often justify political causes are abstracted from the perceptions and motivations of those who actually fight the resulting battles. ""I put you up then because that's what I wanted to do,"" a farmer tells Bill and Jacob when they return armed to his property. ""I'm putting you up now because that's what I got to do. This has become a damned bloody business."" <p>In the hellish frontier of Kevin McColley's novel, one sees the social costs of war. Justice is sacrificed to expediency; good people are killed because they refuse to abandon decency; norms of religion and sexuality give way to disorder and nihilism. Despite several abrupt plot shifts and the occasional use of out-of-place vocabulary  (did Civil War-era folk really refer to sex as ""poontang""?), <b>The Other Side</b> explodes the idealization of war, cautioning against moral numbness. It reminds us finally that civilization is what nudges man to a higher purpose and nobility, away from ""the other side"" of human nature that is monstrous in its potential. <p>""Men are free when they are obeying some deep, inward voice of religious belief,"" D.H. Lawrence observed in <i>Studies in Classic American Literature</i>. ""Men are free when they belong to a living, Organic, <i>believing</i> community, active in fulfilling some unfulfilled, perhaps unrealized purpose. Not when they are escaping to some wild west."" At <b>The Other Side</b>'s finale, Jacob Wilson returns to Ohio with more than his body mutilated;  his soul is also tattered.<p><i>Morgan N. Knull is editor of </i>Civil War Book Review."

1855	823220168		Touched with Fire: Civil War Letters and Diary of Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.		Holmes, Oliver Wendell	Howe, Mark De Wolfe		"On March 8, 1931, associate justice of the United States Supreme Court Oliver Wendell Holmes turned 90. He concluded a short radio address on that occasion by quoting a Roman poet: ""Death plucks my ear and says, Live - I am coming."" <p> With those words, Holmes was not only celebrating his longevity but recognizing his survival in the Civil War. Leaving Harvard during his senior year, Holmes was commissioned in the 20th Massachusetts Volunteer Regiment, in which he rose to the rank of captain. He was thrice wounded - first, in the chest at Ball's Bluff, then in the neck at Antietam, and finally in the foot at Chancellorsville. <p> <b>Touched with Fire</b> contains all of the Civil War letters Holmes wrote to his parents and the complete text of the only wartime diary that was found among his personal papers by Mark De Wolfe Howe, a secretary to Mr. Justice Holmes from 1933 to 1934. First published in 1946, the letters and diary are now reprinted with a new and informative introduction by David H. Burton. As a reprint, the photo illustrations suffer, but Holmes's drawings remain as clear as ever. <p> The letters cover the period from May 1861 to July 1864, during which Holmes participated in the Battle of Ball's Bluff, the Peninsula campaign, Antietam, Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville, and served as aide-de-camp to General Horatio Wright. <p> The routine details of Holmes's wartime experiences underscore the fervor, enthusiasm, barbarity, and boredom of war. In passage after passage, his regiment is depicted as constantly marching between battles, making camp in the harsh elements, confronting the enemy, and witnessing losses in the ranks. Yet to Holmes, the War seemed contained in the space around him without any broad meaning. An April 1864 letter to Charles Eliot Norton expressed doubt about whether the War was ""a crusade in the cause of the whole civilized world."" <p> Holmes's growth from raw recruit to battle-scarred veteran and his journey from patriotic citizen to doubting soldier are clearly articulated in <b>Touched with Fire</b>. It is the story of all veterans in all wars, and that is why this well-written little book is such a valuable resource. In a personal sense, the letters and diary describe Holmes's contemporary reaction to his Civil War experiences and helps explain the essential place of the Civil War in his life. <p> Initially, Holmes's regiment was assigned picket duty on the Maryland side of the Potomac River where it could observe Confederate soldiers on the Virginia shore. Holmes wrote his mother in September 1861: ""It seems so queer to see an encampment & twig men through a glass & think they are our enemies & hear of some of our pickets talking across and so on."" He added, ""All these things gave reality to life but I don't expect any fighting for the present."" In October, his regiment was among those that crossed the Potomac in the ill-fated excursion that ended with the Union debacle at Ball's Bluff. Shot in the chest, Holmes convalesced at home and did not return to the field until March 1862. <p> Next engaged on the Peninsula, his regiment participated in the siege of Yorktown. After two months of inactivity, General Joseph E. Johnston counterattacked on June 25. Seven days of hard fighting later, the regiment retreated from the south side of the Chickahominy River to Harrison's Landing. In a June 2 letter, Holmes wrote: ""It is singular with what indifference one gets to look on the dead bodies in gray clothes wh[ich] lie all around. . . . As you go through the woods you stumble constantly, and if after dark, as last night on picket duty, perhaps tread on the swollen bodies already fly blown and decaying, of men shot in the head back or bowels."" And in a July 5 letter he wrote with war fatigue: ""I'm too tired that is too mentally inefficient to write well but I've sent 2 notes before including a leaf of my pocket book written some time to you in case I was ever killed."" <p> In September 1862 the regiment prepared for fighting near Sharpsburg, Maryland. Holmes's September 17 letter to his parents noted that ""we're in reserve & near to [the enemy] and may fight today. . . . All of us feel a deuced sight more like a fight than in that forlorn peninsula."" Fighting began and the enemy broke through on the regiment's left. Retreating with his men, Holmes was hit in the back of the neck, the ball ""passing straight through the central seam of coat & waistcoat collar coming out toward the front on the left hand side."" He was evacuated several times, and his father, Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes, set out in search of his son and located him in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. As Dr. Holmes describes their meeting in <i>My Hunt After ""The Captain,""</i> the father finds his son in the first railroad car. The father smiles and puts out his hand, ""How are you Boy?"" ""How are you, Dad?"" came the reply. <p> Wounded again at Chancellorsville, Holmes returned to duty as a staff officer during the spring 1864 campaign. On May 6 he wrote, ""Our H.Q. [headquarters] were exposed all day to pretty sharp artillery practice from 3 different directions."" On May 8 Holmes ""found woods afire & bodies of Rebs & our men just killed and scorching."" By May 16, he had had enough. ""I have felt for sometime that I didn't any longer believe in this being a duty & so I mean to leave at the end of the campaign . . . if I'm not killed before."" <p> It was during the abortive attempt by General Early to attack Washington, D.C., from the north at Fort Stevens that the most celebrated incident of Holmes's wartime service allegedly occurred. President Lincoln had visited the fort on July 11 and again on July 12. On the second day, according to later accounts, the president was told, ""get down you damn fool,"" by Captain Holmes. However, there is no mention of this incident in his diary and the two eyewitness accounts fail to mention Holmes as the soldier who roughly ordered the president to get down. <p> Holmes's feelings about his war experiences can be summed up in a June 1864 letter to his mother. He had ""started in this thing a boy [and] I am now a man."" He had enlisted in a burst of enthusiasm, had been three times shot only to be returned to the front, had been hospitalized with dysentery, and had reached a point in his service when ""nearly every regimental off[icer] I knew or cared for is dead or wounded."" Holmes's decision to leave the service rather than reenlist was a combination of desperation at having endured so much carnage and conviction that he had earned in battle the right to say ""enough."" <p> The Civil War retained much significance for Holmes. Like many soldiers before and since, he constantly called attention in his correspondence to the dates of the battles at which he had been wounded. He adopted military themes and metaphors in his writings. As he became further removed in time from the War he incorporated the culture of the professional soldier as part of his general philosophy. He graduated from law school, entered law practice in Boston, became an editor of the <i>American Law Review</i>, published an edition of Kent's Commentaries, wrote the Lowell Lectures (which became <i>The Common Law</i> in 1881), accepted a professorship at Harvard Law School, and resigned that position in 1882 to become associate justice of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts. <p> After Memorial Day had been created to honor the valor and courage of the soldiers on both sides of the conflict, Holmes was asked in 1884 to deliver an address for it at Keene, New Hampshire. He concluded that the new holiday ""embodies in the most impressive form our belief that to act with enthusiasm and faith is the condition of acting greatly. To fight out a war, you must believe something and want something with all your might. . . . Through our great good fortune, in our youth our hearts were touched with fire."" <p> This is an essential reference work in depicting how that patriotic fire turned to ashes. Holmes's memories would transcend the War and become an essential element in the psyche of one of America's greatest jurists. <p> <i>Frank J.

It marched to the Common and the reviewing stands and passed ""through the streets of Boston and into glory,"" as Duncan comments in his biography of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw. Frederick Douglass, William Lloyd Garrison, Wendell Philips, and John Greenleaf Whittier were part of the largest crowd in Boston's history. The parade and review was not merely an occasion for local pride. It was a public symbol of new things. Black men were going to fight against slavery in a war begun to preserve the Union and now widened into a crusade for freedom.<p>As the black regiment swung past, the crowds cheered and wept. The 54th Massachusetts was recruited from the free black families of the North, and Frederick Douglass's eldest son Lewis was a sergeant-major in this elite unit.

In his letter of July 18, 1861, written to his mother from Charleston, Virginia, Shaw noted that he had met a Major Doubleday.

As a sometime baseball historian I am driven to mention that Abner Doubleday had nothing to do with baseball, which was invented in New York in 1841 by Alexander Cartwright. But this bow to legend amidst the sustained excellence of Duncan's editorial work illustrates the intertwined levels of history and myth always present in historical accounts.)<p>The editor-author's introduction to the letters and his biography of Robert Gould Shaw explore two salient issues, one concerning Shaw himself, the other about the War and abolition. Duncan has made no attempt to conceal Shaw's intense personal discomfort over his role as colonel of the 54th Massachusetts. In common with virtually all of his contemporaries in white America, Shaw believed in the inferiority of black people, whom he habitually called ""darkeys"" and worse. Shaw at first rejected the command of the 54th Massachusetts, in spite of the promotion from captain to colonel, in spite of a request via letter from Massachusetts Governor John A. Andrew, and in spite of his father's personal delivery of the letter to lend the weight of moral obligation.<p>Even after he had changed his mind and accepted what he reluctantly believed to be his bounden duty, Shaw had constant doubts about his men. Could they accept the regimen and discipline of military garrison life? He feared the regiment would lack courage under fire. Most of all he dreaded an incident (that never came) that would disgrace the men and discredit both black troops in particular and abolition in general. These doubts and fears dissipated only very slowly, as the men taught him more about black Americans than he did them about war. But Shaw's doubts about his ""colored"" regiment disappeared completely only when he and they died together at Fort Wagner.<p>Both versions of Duncan's biographical sketch of Robert Gould Shaw also emphasize the religious nature of abolition and duty in Shaw's family and social circle. Duncan's inclusion of the Puritan/Protestant religious cast to social reform in the middle decades of the 19th century is one of the great strengths of both books. To the Boston abolitionists who paid for his crusade, John Brown was a fiery saint engaged in the socially salvific work of destroying hellish and demonic slavery. The sin of slavery must be burned from the land, and sufferings inflicted upon the South in the process were simply the just and inevitable result of sowing the wind. The godly duty of all people was to serve and perhaps to die in this conflict of righteousness against sin. Abolitionists clearly saw the hand of God in the new birth of freedom.<p>Nothing less than religious fervor could explain the Boston response to the heroic death of Robert Gould Shaw on the parapets of Fort Wagner and his subsequent burial ""with his niggers,"" as Duncan relates the Confederates' decision to inter Shaw among the black troops in the sand below the fort. Poems celebrated the ""parfit and gentil"" knight of freedom. The 54th Massachusetts (Colored), which had done its duty so bravely, was equally celebrated amidst, one can only suppose, private relief that the soldiers had vindicated themselves. After the War, with slavery destroyed but without that other aim of the Boston Brahmin abolitionists -- full citizenship for black Americans -- Shaw was not forgotten.<p>In 1897, a bas-relief monument by Augustus Saint-Gaudens to Shaw and the 54th Massachusetts was unveiled in the Boston Common. It depicts the march through Boston on that memorable day in May 1863. ""Shaw rides with his men. An angel of the Lord glides over them."" This description by Duncan on page 125 of <b>Where Death and Glory Meet</b> fits the religious connotation of both the ceremony of unveiling and the sacrifice that it commemorates.<p>Robert Gould Shaw and his men did their duty to themselves, their unit, their families, and their common country.

Frederick Douglass, William Lloyd Garrison, Wendell Philips, and John Greenleaf Whittier were part of the largest crowd in Boston's history. The parade and review was not merely an occasion for local pride. It was a public symbol of new things. Black men were going to fight against slavery in a war begun to preserve the Union and now widened into a crusade for freedom.<p>As the black regiment swung past, the crowds cheered and wept.

Furthermore, the ""characters, places, and incidents"" depicted in it definitely are ""products of the author's imagination and are used fictitiously."" Thus, while all of the main characters and events are historical, few of them are described in an historically accurate, full, and balanced fashion. This is particularly the case with the unlikely protagonist, William ""Bloody Bill"" Anderson. <p> Anderson is portrayed as being utterly fearless, a crack shot who would have put Annie Oakley to shame, and routinely capable of marvelous feats, among them conversing with canines-which tempts one to make a remark about his parentage. Also, in the novel's rendering, he does not become a Missouri Confederate guerrilla until 1862 when driven to it as a response to Kansas jayhawkers' vicious persecutions. His sole faults, which are presented as hardly being such, are a penchant for horse rustling, murdering helpless men, and engaging in an incestuous relationship with a sister. <p> When the real Anderson turned to marauding in Missouri in 1861, it was for no nobler reason than monetary gain. He shot most of his dozens of victims at such short range that he could not have missed even if drunk (which he often was). And although undoubtedly brave, he committed acts of rape and torture that can only be described as depraved. The same must be said about many of his followers, who are portrayed in this book as virtually invincible warriors inflicting justified vengeance on nasty ""Yankees"" who are so craven and inept when it comes to combat that they are little more than clay pigeons in human form. <p> Yet the author, James Carlos Blake, does not pretend to be writing scholarly history but rather seeks to tell a good story. In this he succeeds, for he is an experienced expert at writing about what a blurb on the back of the dust jacket terms ""blood and guts."" He could not have picked a better subject for blood and guts than Bill Anderson and his henchmen, and he writes about it skillfully, with plenty of gory detail.

4328			EDITORIAL:<br> New Directions in Civil War History		Childers, Christopher			"Once in a generation it seems, a historian writes a book that literally changes the landscape of the history of the Civil War era.  Scholars dream of producing that one seminal book that changes the way people understand a portion of our history.  And readers eagerly await the next great book that will leave its mark on the fieldโand on them.  In 1956, Kenneth Stamppโs <i>The Peculiar Institution: Slavery in the Ante-Bellum South </i>completely shifted how historians and students of the history of slavery thought about the institution that led the nation into civil war.  In sweeping scope and fascinating detail, Stampp demolished several generations of past scholarship that portrayed slavery as a benign institution.  He chronicled the brutality of slavery and its impact on those who endured the effects of bondage.  But he also depicted slaves as โordinary human beings,"" a superfluous statement by todayโs standards.  But in 1956, and given the nature of what historians had written before that time on slavery, Stamppโs statement and his book revolutionized the study of slavery.</p>
<p>
Kenneth Stampp died on July 10, 2009, at the age of 96.  Over the course of a long and celebrated career, he penned numerous books in addition to his opus on slavery.  But <i>The Peculiar Institution </i>has endured, not because it is the last word on slavery.  On the contrary, successive generations have built on and even revised Stamppโs conclusions.  But Stampp laid the groundwork for their efforts.  <i>CWBR</i> commemorates the life and work of this giant in Civil War history.</p>
<p>
The Summer 2009 issue of <i>CWBR</i> features a wide array of books on the Civil war era, pointing to the diversity of work that scholars continue to produce.  Two new titles in slavery studies are featured.  Marie Jenkins Schwartz reviews Elizabeth Fox-Genovese and Eugene D. Genoveseโs <i>Slavery in White and Black: Class and Race in the Southern Slaveholdersโ New World Order</i>.  And Thavolia Glymphโs <i>Out of the House of Bondage: The Transformation of the Plantation Household</i>, recently named a finalist for the Frederick Douglass Prize, is reviewed by Jim Downs.   </p>
<p>
In this issue, we also continue our commemoration of the bicentennial of Abraham Lincolnโs birth with a review of Harold Holzerโs <i>Lincoln President-Elect: Abraham Lincoln and the Great Secession Winter, 1860-1861</i> by Russell McClintock.  Look in our next issue for the concluding installment of Frank J. Williamsโs A New Birth of Freedom: Celebrating the Life of Lincoln.</p>
<p>
Historians have renewed their focus on economics and the Civil War.  John Majewskiโs <i>Modernizing a Slave Economy: The Economic Vision of the Confederate Nation</i> looks at how economics influenced Confederate policy.  Brian Schoen reviews this book.  And A. James Fuller reviews Marc Egnalโs <i>Clash of Extremes: The Economic Origins of the Civil War</i>, a new interpretation of the role of economics in the sectional conflict. </p>
<p>
In the <i>CWBR</i> Author Interview, Robert E. Bonner discusses his new book <i>Mastering America: Southern Slaveholders and the Crisis of American Nationhood</i>, a fascinating new interpretation of the concept of nationalism and the creation of the Confederacy.  And Leah Wood Jewettโs latest installment of Civil War Treasures focuses on the often strained relationship between freedmen and their former masters.</p>
<p>
The Summer 2009 issue marks my last as editor of <i>Civil War Book Review</i>.  Over the past two and a half years, I have been honored to work with the countless historians who contribute reviews and essays to the journal.  Fortunately, I have had the support of the staff at the LSU Librariesโ Special Collections division, a remarkable organization of professionals who have enthusiastically assisted me in maintaining <i>CWBR</i>.  I know my successor, Nathan Buman, will continue to benefit from the experise and camaderie.</p>
<p>
Finally, I must give special recognition to the over two million visitors who read <i>CWBR</i> each year.  I look forward to joining their ranks as one of the faithful readers and supporters of <i>CWBR</i>.</p>"		Summer 2009	2009-08-01	Editorial								"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=61 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/cwbrdefault.jpg"">"					
1752	807825158		Wilson's Creek		Piston, William Garrett	Hatcher, III, Richard W.		"Once in a great while the publication of a book represents a passing of the torch from one generation of scholars to the next. Such is the case with William Garrett Piston's and Richard W. Hatcher's <b>Wilson's Creek: The Second Battle of the Civil War and the Men Who Fought It</b>. It is evident that these historians have taken up the work on the coming of the Civil War to Missouri so nobly begun by Ed Bearss in the late 1960s and 1970s.<p>The preface explains that the authors hope not only to provide an updated military narrative of the battle, but to place the soldiers into their proper 19th century context and to provide a ""substantial social analysis"" between the common soldiers and the communities they represented. In the pages that follow, the soldiers, both the great and the small, largely speak for themselves through their letters or diaries.<p>The use of these personal stories and poignant vignettes places human faces on a battle in which the Union army alone suffered nearly 25 percent casualties. The reader is introduced to a handful of the men who would converge at Wilson's Creek, and gains an appreciation for how attachments of family, friendship, and community, and, yes, honor, bound the citizen soldiers to their respective lines of battle on that great and terrible day.<p><b>Wilson's Creek</b> is a finely researched effort that places the swirling events unfolding in Missouri in 1861 into the national and historical context that made Missouri one of most bitterly contested states during the War. Years of smoldering resentment between free soil settlers in Kansas and pro-slavery partisans on Missouri's western border set the stage for a drama whose cast included such men as Nathaniel Lyon, the fiery little atheist abolitionist from Fort Riley, Kansas; Colonel Franz Sigel, a compelling but incompetent brigade commander; Sterling Price, a conditional Union man who found himself leading Missouri's troops against Federal authorities; and, finally General Ben McCulloch, a Texas Ranger who some say was haunted by the fact that illness had kept him from dying with his friends at the Alamo. These lead characters are placed amongst a supporting cast of some of the most unorthodox and eccentric officers that either army produced. Over 20 of them would wear general's stars before the War drew to a close four years later.<p>Once the fighting begins, Hatcher and Piston paint a vivid picture -- the best-written account I have ever read -- of the expanding battle and the roles that the soldiers and leaders played in them. The extensive use of several well-drawn maps allows the reader to closely follow the phases of the battle from just before daybreak on August 10, 1861, to its conclusion shortly before noon. They trace the location of key units on the field, their movements, and the ebb and flow of the fighting. The maps are clear and will be easy, even for readers without benefit of military experience, to understand. <p>The authors do an excellent job documenting both armies' uniforms (where they existed), equipment, weapons, and the weapons' characteristics. The creek's terrain and its effect on the visibility and the movement of troops during the battle is amply explored, as are the effects of the day's heat and humidity. Near the end of <b>Wilson's Creek</b> the authors also take pains to explore the reasons why Nathaniel Lyon felt driven to risk a major battle with a superior enemy force.<p>The use of Tom Sweeny's superb collection of Civil War photographs and images adds tremendously to the overall effectiveness of the book. For example, a close inspection of a rare pre-battle photograph of Company H, 3rd Arkansas Infantry, Arkansas State Troops, reveals what appears to be an integrated unit with blacks and American Indians serving in the ranks.<p>This book will close the gap in many Civil War enthusiasts' libraries concerning the opening phases of the War in the Trans-Mississippi Theater. For serious historians, the footnotes alone are worth the price of the book. <b>Wilson's Creek</b> is the benchmark against which all future works regarding the battle and the struggle for Missouri will be judged.<p><i>R. Scott Price, a major in the U.S. Army Reserves, is author of </i>Nathaniel Lyon: Harbinger From Kansas<i> (1991) and </i>The Ghosts of Fort Riley<i> (1998). He has just finished a fictional work on Civil War drummer boys entitled </i>The Shattered Drum<i>, and currently has two other books underway.</i>"	Price, R.

2127	393046044		The Valley of the Shadow: Two Communities in the American Civil War with CD-ROM		Ayers, Edward L.	Rubin, Anne S.		"Once in a great while, we encounter a scholarly work so thoroughly unprecedented that we must strain to comprehend and explain it. So it is with the new book and CD-ROM set, <b>Valley of the Shadow: The Eve of War</b>. In this case, the innovation is not so much in the form of the work-there are other CD-ROM and book combinations-but in the information in the package, and in its myriad implications. <p> Even the more familiar product, the book, attests to the originality of <b>Valley of the Shadow</b>. It contains only three chapters. In the first, we encounter a rousing description of the subject communities, Augusta County in Virginia and Franklin County in Pennsylvania. Edward L. Ayers and Anne S. Rubin reveal the unexpected connections of the two areas: both rest within the Great Valley (called Shenandoah in Virginia, Cumberland in Pennsylvania), both benefited from the same migration patterns, outside of slavery their economies were more similar than different, and both would suffer in the war that lay ahead. As an introductory piece, the chapter is unusual. It does not set up a specific thesis or delineate historiographical boundaries. Instead, Ayers and Rubin use the early pages to let their subjects speak for themselves. Quotes abound, revealing both what had united and what would separate these two counties and their nation, and these voices herald the intriguing presentation that follows in book and CD-ROM. <p> Ayers should be well-known to those interested in the history of 19th century America; he is author or co-editor of several books, including a prize-winning synthesis, <i>The Promise of the New South: Life After Reconstruction</i>, and is Hugh P. Kelly Professor of History at the University of Virginia. He is also founder of the Valley of the Shadow Project at the University of Virginia, where Anne Rubin was project director from 1994-96. She now teaches at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and will soon publish a monograph, <i>A Shattered Nation: The Rise and Fall of the Confederacy, 1861-1868.</i> <p> In the second chapter of <b>Valley of the Shadow</b>, Ayers and Rubin examine what they call ""digital history."" Here, the uniqueness of the collection becomes more evident, for readers learn about the history of the Valley of the Shadow Project, the features of the CD, some paths through the electronic records, and the credo of the larger enterprise and this compilation. As Ayers and Rubin proclaim on page 30, patterns wait ""latent in the digital data we provide, but they become history only when people translate them into stories and arguments. And there will be arguments. The Valley Project demonstrates what historians have long known: the evidence does not speak for itself, nor does it tell only one story."" Five pages later, they profess that their work ""does not push any particular interpretation,"" and encourage those engaged with <b>Valley of the Shadow</b> to accept that ""there were more than two sides to the Civil War, that blacks and whites, rich and poor, Democrats and Republicans, and men and women saw things differently."" <p> One begins to suspect that <b>Valley of the Shadow</b> is offered in a new form because accepted methods of historical presentation are not quite adequate for the breadth and variety of this way of telling the story. The extensive third chapter, ""The Impending Crisis,"" contains ample evidence of this new dilemma. By traditional standards, this narrative section provides a compelling introduction to the politics and public events that led toward civil war. National developments, well-known leaders and their issues, and political maneuvering and outcomes are all explored in a crisp and engaging style. The authors even manage to connect national and regional events to the people of Augusta and Franklin counties, and do so without reducing the two communities to local-color status, or oversimplifying national questions in the limited context. <p> But traditional standards, the book's earlier chapters have proclaimed, no longer apply. Readers have been promised they can have more, that the past holds more than one compelling story, and that they can find and assess it for themselves in an ongoing dialogue of past and present. This sort of democratic promise is hard to make and easy to break. Fortunately, the CD-ROM delivers even more than the book suggests. <p> Opening the CD (which is Windows- and Mac-compatible), one is immediately struck by the wealth and variety of the information within. One option is to proceed by choosing from the different types of information: diaries and letters, enlistments, music, census and tax records, churches, maps, newspapers, images, timelines, or reference. Selecting any one of these options narrows the breadth of information available but introduces a great depth of data. <p> Genealogists, for example, will delight in the opportunity to search quickly and thoroughly through all the extant records for these two counties before the Civil War. Those primarily interested in the war itself will be astounded at how many doubting voices were raised before the conflict, as men and women in each community questioned the likelihood of war, the wisdom of military preparations, and finally, their people's ability to escape the conflict. Students and other researchers will be amazed at the ease with which <b>Valley of the Shadow</b> delivers up the secrets of the past, reducing inquiries that might have required months of archival work to a few keystrokes and a brief wait. Even more readily than the Valley of the Shadow website, the CD-ROM makes it easy to undertake a self-guided tour along the path toward war. <p> But not all users will want to embark without a guide, nor should they. For those desiring a more structured approach, the CD offers another option, ""The Valley Album."" Instead of organizing the information by types of record, the Album is set up by topic. One may choose to learn about the Great Valley, households and farms, runaway slaves, John Brown, secession, or the beginning of the war, among many others. Pursuing any one of these topics opens information in a variety of ways: users can hear Ayers's audio assessment of the issue, look at illustrations from the period, or explore digital sources for a customized approach to the question. Thus, the Album offers the scholarly framework that users less familiar with the era's history may initially need, while also providing resources to encourage individual assessments and interpretations of major issues. Advanced high school and college students will appreciate this unique combination of guidance and intellectual opportunity, and the work should soon be on the reading lists of numerous courses concerned with 19th century America and the Civil War. <p> There are risks to this approach. Users of <b>Valley of the Shadow</b> enter a re-creation of the past without the usual boundary markers of scholarship; indeed, users are expected to construct their own intellectual analysis. Moreover, this work about the origins of the Civil War avoids naming any particular cause as central to the conflict's occurrence; neither fanaticism, nor separate economies, nor diverging societies, nor political ineptitude is singled out as the most important element. <p> Yet, the text, especially in the third and longest chapter, does imply an overarching perspective. We are reminded that it was the peculiar history of this era-the unanticipated events, innovations, and mistakes of the years preceding First Manassas-that led to the adoption of extreme measures and the acceptance of harsh consequences. Ayers says as much in an audio clip in the CD's Album, describing history as ""people responding to events beyond their control in the best way they can think of."" Indeed, the Valley Project is designed ""to show how people make their own history . . . day by day. . . ."" By opening up records that transport so much of the past, <b>Valley of the Shadow: The Eve of War</b> gives us each the opportunity to write and understand history ""day by day,"" to comprehend the ways our subjects were swept along and struggled, and to appreciate the new sense of nation their sacrifices brought forth. <p> <i>John C.

1895	1557285918		Pea Ridge and Prairie Grove: Or, Scenes and Incidents of the War in Arkansas		Baxter, William	Shea, William L.		"Originally published in 1864, William Baxter's first-hand observations in and around Fayetteville, Arkansas, between 1860 and 1863 now have received a second reprinting in <b>Pea Ridge and Prairie Grove</b>. Though he meticulously describes the Confederate troops marching to and from the 1862 battles of Pea Ridge and Prairie Grove, he was not present during the fighting. Indeed, Baxter's account is social rather than military history. <p> Born in England, Baxter immigrated to the United States with his parents. After graduating from Bethany College in 1845, he devoted himself to teaching and ministering. His profession took him to Pennsylvania, Louisiana, and Mississippi before he arrived in Fayetteville in 1858. There, as president of Arkansas College and the head of a large congregation, his roots spread quickly. Despite his unionist inclination, economics influenced him to remain in the predominantly pro-secessionist community after the outbreak of war. <p> Fayetteville changed hands six times during the first 18 months of the War. Though he curbed his tongue when discussing politics, Baxter's neighbors knew where he stood. His moderate behavior and befriending of Confederate sympathizers regardless of who held the town made little difference to them. Each time Confederate troops reoccupied the town, life became more precarious for the ever-dwindling number of unionists who remained. The irregular soldiers who traveled the area in bands proved even more dangerous than the occupying troops, and northern troops treated his property almost as badly as the Southerners. Finally, in February 1863, the now-penniless Baxter and his family accompanied a Union wagon train northward. <p> Once he reached the safety of St. Louis, Baxter began penning this volume. Where other sources exist that relate to the events he recounts, they substantiate his accuracy. Considering what he had endured and his political inclinations, he managed to curb most of his bias. He presents the good and bad of both sides, with Confederate General Benjamin McCulloch portrayed as the most villainous of all. It could hardly be otherwise, since Baxter held him responsible for the wanton destruction of Arkansas College.  <p> William L. Shea's introduction to this edition substantially enhances <b>Pea Ridge and Prairie Grove's</b> value. Researchers may be disappointed to find that the University of Arkansas Press did not prepare an index to the volume, and readers will search in vain for a map showing the various towns, roads, and intersections that Baxter mentions in his account. Despite these omissions, Baxter's history is a worthy addition to The Civil War in the West series, edited by Anne Bailey and Daniel Sutherland. <p> <i>Formerly a historic site manager, professor of history, and managing editor of </i>North & South, <i>Lawrence Lee Hewitt (<A HREF=""mailto:llhinc@mcs.com"">llhinc@mcs.com</a>) resides in Chicago.</i>"	Hewitt, Lawrence Lee	Winter 2001	2000-12-01	Review	Unionist minister's history of wartime Arkansas returns to print	Unpopular beliefs	University of Arkansas Press	36586				"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=249 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/BaxterPeaBridgeandPrairieGrove.jpg"">"

1727	1892514060		The Lines are Drawn: Political Cartoons of the Civil War	Lines are Drawn: Political Cartoons of the Civil War The	Smith, Kristen M.			"Political cartoons have the power to illustrate the historical period to which they belong. For many baby-boomers, the political turmoil of the early 1970s can be visualized by recalling <i>Doonesbury</i>'s portrayal of the brick wall appearing around the Nixon White House. Editor Kristen M. Smith, a journalist and cartoonist, has compiled more than 130 cartoon samples that cover the gamut of political partisanship with caricatures of politicians and generals and depictions of draft dodgers, war profiteers, army recruiters, and Northern Copperheads.<p>Some of the drawings are crude; others include distracting, crowded dialogue balloons. Dreadful puns may be lost on contemporary readers, but a few of the pieces sparkle with clever incisiveness. For example, an 1860 Currier & Ives lithograph captioned ""The Nigger' in the Woodpile"" features Horace Greeley assuring a voter that the Republican Party ""has no connection with the Abolition party,"" while a beardless Abraham Lincoln clings to the top of a pyramid of split rails (labeled ""Republican Platform"") as a grinning black man peers out from within.<p>Although <b>The Lines Are Drawn</b> provides a useful sampling, several problems undermine its effectiveness. The editor's selection criteria are never adequately explained. The inclusion of examples from the Confederacy is an admirable attempt at balance, but only A.J. Volck's cartoons measure up to the standards set by Northern artists. The organization of the book is logical, but lacks focus. Subjects like race, dissent, and politics are mentioned without being explained, and the chronological format isolates cartoons that may have been more thoroughly understood in topical sections.<p>This lack of contextual focus carries over into the explanatory paragraphs, which often provide useful, if basic, information but rarely connect one cartoon to another. Some seem misinterpreted. For instance, a confusing scene on page 127 showing U.S. Grant destroying a golden idol as financiers kneel before it is somehow explained as a reference to Grant overturning his predecessors' timid military strategy, and on page 144 a one-legged white veteran shaking hands with a one-legged black veteran over the caption ""A Man Knows A Man"" is surprisingly identified as a former Confederate.<p>Political cartoons can be potent avenues of research for historians, as many of the examples in this volume prove. William F. Thompson showed how to incorporate history with artistry in <i>The Image of War</i>, a minor classic about the sketch artists traveling with the Union armies. A truly useful study of wartime cartoons would take similar care in establishing contexts and explaining the images that can tell us so much about this era of crisis.<p><i>James Marten is associate professor of history at Marquette University and author of </i>Texas Divided: Loyalty and Dissent in the Lone Star State, 1856-1874 <i>and</i> The Children's Civil War."

1890	813919517		Slavery, Secession, and Southern History		Paquette, Robert L.	Ferleger, Lou		"Presented as a tribute to Eugene D. Genovese, the ten substantial and arresting essays in <b>Slavery, Secession, and Southern History</b> are on varying topics in the history of the antebellum South. But either explicitly or implicitly, each testifies to the importance of Genovese's remarkably comprehensive contribution to the struggle of American historians to interpret the history of the Old South's slave society, and the relation of this history to the Civil War. In addition, the appended interview with Genovese, in which editors Robert Louis Paquette and Louis A. Ferleger put questions to him, commands as much attention as the essays that precede it. <p> Genovese observes in this interview that until he renounced Marxism in 1995, his inquiry into the culture and ideology of the slave society of the Old South was governed by ""materialistic and atheistic"" suppositions. Yet, he adds, his application of Marxist doctrine to southern history always tended to be ""idiosyncratic."" Never one to treat the American South as ""just another regional variant,"" he sensed from ""the beginning"" that ""it was indeed different,"" and should be viewed as ""a historical phenomenon that once generated a people apart and had the germs of a separate nationality."" Although for a long time he did not allow himself to doubt the Marxist faith, he recounts an increasing attraction to the possibilities of interpreting the distinct world of the Old South in the light of the thought of social and literary conservatives from Edmund Burke and John C. Calhoun to T.S. Eliot and Allen Tate. <p> If we look at Genovese's career to date, we detect the developing influence of conservatism in his penetrating treatment of George Fitzhugh in his second book, <i>The World the Slaveholders Made</i>. In this work, even as he deplores their support of slavery, he portrays the pro-slavery writers of the antebellum South not as curious anachronisms but as uniquely significant contributors to the body of modern thought on social relations. His growing insight into the complexities of the world the masters made suggested to Genovese that in order to grasp the full meaning of this world, he must ""weigh the slaveholders' view of the slaves against the realities of slavery and the perceptions of the slaves themselves."" The result was his remarkable <i>Roll, Jordan, Roll: The World the Slaves Made</i>. <p>  <b>The mind of the master class</b> <p> In their survey of Genovese's role in ""Changing Views of Slavery in the United States,"" an essay that introduces <b>Slavery, Secession, and Southern History</b>, Robert William Fogel and Stanley L. Engerman single out <i>Roll, Jordan, Roll</i> as the author's greatest work. In view of this evaluation, it may be surprising that no other contributors to the volume place such explicit emphasis on this book. However, the comparative inattention to <i>Roll, Jordan, Roll</i> is in accord with the place it occupies in relation to Genovese's primary goal (which he shares with his wife and co-author, Elizabeth Fox-Genovese) in the interpretation of southern history: a comprehensive work on the mind of the master class. <p> Since his renunciation of Marxism, Genovese sees his experience in writing <i>Roll, Jordan, Roll</i> as resulting in a significant enhancement of his awareness of religion in the history in the South, that is, religion ""understood to include the spiritual, the institutional, the social, the political, and the intellectual."" Thus <i>Roll, Jordan, Roll</i> may be read as a work that implicitly projects what Genovese indicates is ""precisely at issue"" in the historical study of the South: the achievement of an ""integrated history"" of the world the masters made and the world the slaves made. <p> Although not by deliberate design, the essays in <b>Slavery, Secession, and Southern History</b> represent various approaches to the problem of writing such a history. Part I of the volume, titled ""Slavery,"" includes David Brion Davis's masterly comment on ""The Problem of Slavery,"" which provides a way of looking at the complexity of master-slave relations in the American South in the general context of such relations from Grecian times to the present. Essays by other contributors to this section examine the master-slave relationship within the specific context of southern history. Robert Paquette investigates the relation between the masters and the ""drivers,"" the slaves whom plantation masters entrusted to take charge of the other slaves. Peter A. Coclanis describes the differences between the relationship of masters and slaves on plantations employing the ""task system"" of slave labor as opposed to the situation of those employing the ""gang labor system."" <p> <b>Historical burden of slavery</b> <p> In Part II, ""Secession,"" Clyde N. Wilson presents a cogent analysis of Calhoun's ""economic platform,"" demonstrating how the ""great depth and subtlety"" of Genovese's profound explication of Calhoun's defense of the ""organic society"" of the southern plantation allows us to understand how this society was an expression of the ""worldview of the planter class."" It was a vision that allowed for ""material progress, but a progress morally centered"" in its necessary commitment to the ""unique historical burden of slavery."" Douglas Ambrose offers a provocative study of Henry Hughes and the Reverend John Henley Thornwell as proponents of ""statism in the Old South."" Contrary to the claim that Southerners always opposed the centralization of power, Ambrose demonstrates how, in trying to cope with the moral and social burden the southern masters believed slavery imposed on them, Hughes and Thornwell advocated what amounted to an ""expansion of state intervention into nearly every aspect of society."" <p> Drew Gilpin Faust shows how, in the case of one female member of the Virginia master class, Catherine Edmond-ston, ""the legitimation the southern master class embraced and practiced"" during the Civil War ""proved literally self-defeating."" In the section's final essay, Thavolia Glymph recalls how another woman of the master class, the South Carolinian Mary Boykin Chesnut, revised the manuscript of her wartime journal after the War to achieve a ""literary victory for women of her class and race"" at the expense of ""African-American women, slave and free."" In doing so, Glymph argues, Chesnut was essentially perpetuating the myth that the mistress of the plantation epitomized the virtue and honor of the defeated South. <p> The concluding section devoted to ""Southern History"" features two essays that address the history of the South in other contexts. In ""Measuring the South: Health, Height, and Literary Myths,"" Louis Ferleger and Richard H. Steckel deal with another aspect of the myth of the ruined South, presenting evidence that William Faulkner's depiction of Southerners as stunted in mind and body by economic deprivation is contrary to statistical studies of the physical condition of Southerners. Ferleger and Stickel seem to find that the chief value of literature is its ""power"" to ""inspire"" historians ""to consider issues and questions raised by literary sources and impressed on the popular mind,"" and in so doing ""separate the truth from the fiction."" In marked contrast to this view of fiction and history, Mark G. Malvasi's astute analysis of Allen Tate's examination of the failure of the myth of the traditional South in Tate's famous novel <i>The Fathers</i> raises the question of whether myth may be truer than fact. <p> Altogether, <b>Slavery, Secession, and Southern History</b> is at once a distinguished contribution to southern studies and a worthy tribute to one of the major American historians of his generation. <p> <i>Lewis P.

2163	1571201041	$25.95	Civil War Women: Their Quilts, Their Roles & Activities for Re-Enactors		Brackman, Barbara			"Quilts have long held a fascination for Americans. Highly symbolic and intricately constructed, their patterns contain historical meaning understood by their creators as well as their modern collectors. Barbara Brackman is a quilter and historian who recognizes the importance of these textiles, particularly those produced during the Civil War. <b>Civil War Women</b>, her latest book, explores individual women and quilts of the period, and the connections that can be made between them. <p> The research and patterns in Brackman's 1997 book,  <i>Quilts from the Civil War</i>, were well-received. That book provides historical information - on the Underground Railroad, soldiers' aid societies, fundraising fairs, wartime hardship, and patriotism - alongside stories of quilts and their quilters. The result is as much a craft book as a history, and includes amazing photographs of original and reproduced quilts in full color. <p> For this reason, it might be asked: is there more to say about Civil War quilts, and can the original book be improved upon? <b>Civil War Women</b> provides a resounding ""yes"" to both questions. <p> <b>Civil War Women</b> is a feast for the eyes. Not only does it include numerous photographs of quilts and easy-to-use patterns, it is filled with period photographs and illustrations. The focus of this book is, of course, quilts. However, Brackman takes a more sociological approach by basing each of the nine chapters on a War-era woman. When describing a woman's life, Brackman chooses a quilt pattern to which she believes the subject would have been drawn, given her personality and lifestyle. Her women are diverse, from freedwoman Susie King Taylor to nurse Hannah Ropes to spy Belle Edmondson. With each biographical sketch and quilt history she offers excellent patterns to reproduce the quilt designs shown. <p> The one weakness is Brackman's decision to suggest reenactor activities at the end of chapters. Most of the suggestions are mundane for the experienced reenactor (e.g. writing letters home or sewing a quilt), and some are less than appropriate for a military reenactment (giving a ""stump speech"" on a social movement such as abolitionism; smuggling contraband sewing goods). In fact, some of the activities would be more appropriate for museum youth programs than for a Civil War reenactment. <p> All in all, Barbara Brackman has produced a lovely and insightful book on women and textiles of the era. <b>Civil War Women</b> will appeal to crafters, history buffs, and reenactors alike, and offers a good list of memoirs and diaries for further research.  <p> <i>Karen R Mehaffey is a library director, writer, and reenactor who is currently writing a book on mourning and the American Civil War.</i>"	Mehaffey, Karen Rae	Winter 2001	2000-12-01	Review	Biographical vignettes, quilts, and activities present social history	Stitched memories	C&T Publishing, Inc.	36800			women, reenact, quilt, Civil War	"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=208 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/BrackmanCivilWarWomen.jpg"">"

1499	312254954		Delirium of the Brave: A Novel of Savannah	Delirium of the Brave: A Novel of Savannah	Harris Jr., William C.			"Readers who expect a Civil War story in <b>Delirium of the Brave</b> will be disappointed. The Civil War is just a gimmick used by William C. Harris, Jr. to set up his saga of several Savannah, Georgia, families from Civil War times till the present. It begins with a prologue in which the ""Grand Dragon of the Invisible Empire"" watches a boat load of strangers land on a small island in the marshes of the Georgia coast. Later, the ""Grand Dragon"" and his ""klavern"" turn out to be a herd of feral pigs that is personified (the way that animals are in fairy tales) so they can worry about such things as their ""gene pools"" and ""the big thunder"" of human's guns.<p>The story begins at the shank end of the Civil War as a young Confederate officer, Captain Patrick Driscoll, and his slave, Shadrack Bryan, prepare to defend Savannah from ravaging Union gunboats with a large cannon at Battery Jasper on Raccoon Island. Captain Driscoll's family has given him a chest with the family treasure to hide on the island. Shortly afterward, the Confederate cannon blows up and kills Driscoll. Moments later, a shell from the Union gunboat kills Shadrack too, so that the location of the buried treasure is lost.<p>From here, the author begins a long and frequently distracting saga of several Savannah families as they wend their way into the 20th century and end up in the 1990s still looking for the treasure. I say distracting because of the strange and confusing passages of explication that accompany the story and often throw the reader out of time or place and that sometimes read like a travel guide for the city of Savannah.<p>For instance, when the author is describing an automobile of the 1930s, we are given this information: ""Even the name of Mr. Packard's machine, the Dual Cowled Ph'ton, suggested some awesome monster from Greek Mythology. Ph'ton, indeed, was a son of the Greek god Helios, who drove his father's sun-chariot wildly through the sky until he lost control and was struck down by a thunderbolt from Zeus as punishment."" In fiction, if you must refer to the classics or to the Bible, it is customary to assume your reader will get the drift when you allude to a character such as, say, Job -- or, for that matter, Ph'ton -- without burdening him with the entire story.<p>As the saga continues, we meet the O'Boyle family, who are corrupt and mean-spirited Irish politicos, and the upstanding Hartman family, newcomers to Savannah who are repeatedly done in by the O'Boyles. The elder O'Boyle committed a heinous crime in the 1950s, which comes back to haunt him and his son in the end.<p>The bulk of the story entails the trials and tribulations of the younger Hartman, John-Morgan, and the younger O'Boyle, Tony, beginning in the early 1960s when they attend a Catholic military school in Savannah. Catholicism, in fact, plays a large role in <b>Delirium of the Brave</b>. All the principal characters are Irish Catholic except for ""Bubba"" Silverman, who is Jewish but also attends the Catholic school, and Lloyd Bryan, who is Catholic but not Irish.<p>Young Hartman and O'Boyle develop a hatred of one another early on in school when a fight develops over a girl, and the antipathy intensifies as the years pass by. Hartman and his friend Mike Sullivan join the Marines and go to Vietnam. O'Boyle goes too, later becoming a Navy SEAL.<p>While Hartman and Sullivan are in Vietnam, Hartman's long-range patrol becomes involved in a fierce firefight in which Hartman calls in artillery fire from a firebase ""almost thirty miles away."" (Never mind that the biggest Marine field artillery weapons in Vietnam had an effective range of only about half that distance. I point out this factual error because, while it may seem like nitpicking -- and all writers, including me, make  them from time to time -- factual errors damage the credibility of everything else the author writes.)<p>Much time in the story is now skipped over to ""cut to the chase."" Twenty-five years later, Hartman is a doctor in Savannah. Mean-spirited Tony O'Boyle is a lawyer running for governor, Lloyd Bryan has given up pro football for the priesthood, rough and tumble Mike Sullivan is a contractor, and Bubba Silverman sells stocks in Atlanta. They all decide to meet back in Savannah for the traditional St. Patrick's Day parade, and the story reaches its conclusion in a resumed hunt for the buried treasure, the discovery of a skeleton, and the solution of mysteries of many, many years.<p>What strikes this reader is that so many of the events this tale turns upon seem to be contrived and unlikely coincidences, as if the author first wrote the scene, then somehow had to justify it. Coupled with the overblown explication and factual errors pointed out above, the book is uneven to the point of being jerky. The author had the elements of a good story, but it is clear that what this book needed most was a good editor.<p><i>Winston Groom is the author of 13 books, including </i>Forrest Gump<i> and </i>Shrouds of Glory<i>, a history of the Battle of Nashville.

1862	60174455		Covered with Glory: The 26th North Carolina Infantry at Gettysburg		Gragg, Rod			Regimental histories are often lost in an endless sea of Civil War books. Their stories can be similar and pale in popular interest to books addressing topics such as the causes of the Civil War or the lives of famous generals. However, some regiments, by luck or fate, found themselves confronted with glory or destruction and merit special attention if one is to fully understand the battle whose outcome they shaped. The 26th North Carolina was such a regiment. <p> Concentrating on the regiment's young leader, Colonel Henry King Burwyn, Jr., and several key officers and enlisted men, award-winning author Rod Gragg marches readers alongside the 26th from training, through the War, and onward to the climax at Gettysburg. <p> The 26th North Carolina was assigned to Brigadier General James Johnston Pettigrew's Brigade in General A.P. Hill's Corps. On July 1, 1863, shortly after the fighting around Gettysburg began, the mostly untested 26th North Carolina collided with the famed Iron Brigade near McPherson's Ridge, shattering the 19th Indiana and 24th Michigan regiments. However, the 26th paid a fearful price. Of the more than 800 men who marched with that unit on July 1st, only 216 escaped the fighting unharmed. Two days later, the survivors helped form the assault on Cemetery Ridge in what is now known as Pickett's Charge. Just 80 would return. In three days of fighting, the 26th North Carolina suffered an 85% casualty rate, the highest of any unit during the War. <p> Gragg should be commended for his ability to focus attention on the 26th North Carolina's actions while also presenting an overview of the War and the general movements that led to Gettysburg and its aftermath. Unlike many, Gragg possesses the ability to convey the horror, brutality, and confusion of war. He paints a descriptive picture of the sweltering and bloodstained Pennsylvania fields and the struggle endured by each soldier. <p> While <b>Covered With Glory</b> is the product of extensive research, it is ultimately built upon first-person accounts found in the works of others. Thoughts and perceptions are often presented without footnote, raising the possibility that Gragg has either employed a certain degree of artistic licensing or used footnotes improperly. Structurally the book often suffers from poor paragraph formation and repetitive thought. While factual mistakes are present, they are few in number and do not impact greatly on the book's account of the battle.  <p> In the end, <b>Covered With Glory</b> merits attention. Rod Gragg presents an interesting account sure to entertain readers and edu-cate those interested in the Battle of Gettysburg.  <p> <i>John Benson, an assistant district attorney in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, is vice president of the Bucks County Civil War Roundtable and a participant at the Civil War Institute.

1453	157249168X		Warrior in Gray: General Robert Rodes of Lee's Army		Swisher, James K.			"Robert Emmett Rodes strode across Douglas Southall Freeman's  Lee's Lieutenants ""as if he stepped out from the pages of <i>Beowulf</i>."" A tall, blond-haired man, Rodes emerges in the hands of Freeman as one of the Army of Northern Virginia's finest warriors and as a romantic figure. The unforgettable image of Rodes is etched in the darkening woods around Chancellorsville as Stonewall Jackson turns to his subordinate and says, ""You can go forward then, General Rodes."" <p> Since Rodes's death at the Battle of Third Winchester, the historic portrait of the soldier has been primarily confined to the pages of Freeman's seminal three-volume work. Rodes has eluded historians because the documentary record is scant. Before her death, his wife, Virginia H.W. Rodes, destroyed all of his papers and personal letters in her possession. That act has muted a full study of her husband as a man and as a soldier. <p> Rodes's performances on some of the bloodiest battlefields in the East during the Civil War merits historical inquiry. Born in Lynchburg, Virginia, on March 30, 1829, educated at the Virginia Military Institute, and an engineer before the War, he rose from the colonelcy of the 5th Alabama to divisional command in less than two years. By the spring of 1863, when his division spearheaded Jackson's famous flank attack at Chancellorsville, Rodes was among the army's best combat officers. <p> Like others in the Confederate army, Rodes faltered at Gettysburg. During the Overland campaign and in the Shenandoah Valley campaign during the spring and summer of 1864, however, he reestablished himself as a gifted divisional commander. Early on the afternoon of September 19, 1864, on the outskirts of Winchester, Virginia, as he prepared his brigades for a counterattack, Rodes died instantly when a shell fragment struck his head. His remains were hauled to Lynchburg and interred in the Presbyterian cemetery. <p> A chronicle of Rodes's Confederate service is a chronicle of the Army of Northern Virginia, except for the War's final months. He led his Alabamians at First Manassas and charged with them at Seven Pines. His brigade defended a gap on South Mountain and he  stood with it in the ""Bloody Lane"" at Sharpsburg. As a divisional commander, Rodes was at Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, the Wilderness, Spotsylvania Court House, Cold Harbor, Monocacy, Cool Spring, and Third Winchester. His is a record matched by few others in the army at his level of command. <p> James K. Swisher offers the first full-length biography of this fine Confederate warrior. Undaunted by the reluctance of other historians to undertake a study of Rodes, Swisher examined an impressive number of sources for his book. Without Rodes's personal wartime correspondence, particularly to his wife, the soldier overwhelms the man. Swisher's study, except for a fine examination of his prewar life, is almost entirely a narrative of marches, camps, and battles. Whatever private views Rodes expressed to his wife about fellow officers, the army's operations, and Confederate fortunes evidently disappeared when his wife burned his correspondence. <p> Consequently, Swisher has written a yeoman study of the Confederate Rodes. The author treats the subject fairly, but <b>Warrior in Gray</b> is a highly sympathetic treatment of Rodes. Without the general's personal papers, Swisher seldom gets beyond the Confederate uniform. <p> <b>Warrior in Gray</b> is a book, however, plagued with factual errors and spelling and grammatical mistakes. Individuals are either misidentified or their names misspelled. Winfield Scott Hancock, for example, is both ""John Hancock"" and ""Scott W. Hancock."" Numbers of individuals, particularly Federals, are introduced in the text without their first names. Events are misdated, and the traditional interpretations of generals and campaigns are followed. Finally, the number of run-on paragraphs testifies to the need for an editor. It would seem that the publisher did not give the manuscript a critical reading. <p>  Nevertheless, Swisher's <b>Warrior in Gray</b> is a welcome book. Civil War buffs and historians have a biography of a Confederate officer who has deserved a study for a long time. Although Freeman's Nordic giant hovers in the background, Swisher's work is a fairer and more balanced portrait. <p> <i>A high school history teacher, Jeffry D. Wert is author of five books on the Civil War:</i> From Winchester to Cedar Creek (1987), Mosby's Rangers (1991), General James Longstreet (1994), Custer (1997), <i>and</i> A Brotherhood of Valor (1999). <i>He currently is working on</i> Gettysburg -  Day Three."

1669	1883522242		First and Second Maryland Cavalry	First and Second Maryland Cavalry	Driver Jr., Robert J.			Robert J. Driver's <b>First and Second Maryland Cavalry, C.S.A.</b> provides an in-depth look at Maryland during the War, her divided loyalties, and the brave men and boys who left their native state to serve the South. Their departure from hearth and home was no mean feat. At great personal peril, they crossed the Potomac to join Confederate ranks. If caught by Federal authorities, they often would be imprisoned; the less fortunate were either shot or hanged. Yet, those who successfully crossed into Virginia served with the best the Confederacy had to offer.The book's narrative gains momentum as the two Maryland units are formed. For the most part, the book describes in great detail activities of the 1st Maryland. Due to the short duration of the 2nd Maryland Cavalry, less time is devoted to that unit's history. The Davis Battalion of Maryland Cavalry is also covered, but its history is short and the unit eventually was assimilated into the 1st Maryland.<p>The history of the 1st Maryland Cavalry parallels that of the Army of Northern Virginia. The 1st Maryland saw action during the Peninsula campaign, served with Jackson in the glory days of the Valley, raided Union supply lines and conducted raids in both Virginia and Maryland during the middle years of the War, and saw action at Gettysburg. From Gettysburg on its men continued to share the fate of their fellow confederates and by 1864 the unit was greatly reduced in ranks, though small numbers of new Marylander recruits continued to cross the Potomac. Finally, it served as rear guard for Robert E. Lee's infantry during the Appomattox campaign and, when the balance of the Army of Northern Virginia surrendered, many of the Maryland cavalrymen chose to remain in the saddle. Driver's work is meticulously researched, and he weaves an interesting and compelling narrative. It is loaded with quotes by the men who served in these units. His thorough grasp of the subject matter is evident, and his book offers a lasting contribution to the study of border states, orphan brigades, and specifically -- Maryland. One point of contention: the reader would be greatly aided were subtitles placed throughout the text to highlight changes of events as well as battles.<p>About one-third of the book is devoted to muster rolls of the men who served in the 1st and 2nd Maryland and is a work in itself. While browsing through the rolls one reads of every possible fortune that could await a soldier: death, imprisonment, desertion, court-martial, bravery, honor, and particularly survival.<p>Supplemented with ample maps and photographs, <b>First and Second Maryland Cavalry, C.S.A.</b> offers a rich reading experience -- well worth its $34.95 price.<p><i>Timothy Daiss is a journalist, freelance writer, and author of </i>In the Saddle: Exploits of the 5th Georgia Cavalry During the Civil War<i> (Schiffer Publishing).</i>	Daiss , Timothy	Winter 2000	1999-12-01	Review	Lee's Maryland cavalrymen defied odds and allegiances	Crossing the Potomac	Rockbridge Publishing	0000-00-00				"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=245 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/RobertDriverFirstandSecondMarylandCavalry.jpg"">"

1976	916489884		Lost Soul: The Confederate Soldier in New England	Lost Soul: The Confederate Soldier in New England	Rolston, Les			"Samuel Postlethwaite, a private in the 21st Mississippi Infantry, served the Confeder-ate States from the beginning of the CivilWar until his severe wounding at Malvern Hill in 1862. Following the War he resided in Mississippi and eventually moved north to live with the Greenes, his relatives in Rhode Island. Postlethwaite died in August 1876, a year after his arrival in New England. A marble block inscribed ""S.P."" once marked his grave. In <b>Lost Soul</b>, Les Rolston credits Sam as the only Confederate soldier known to be buried in Rhode Island.<p>Genealogists and historians alike will be disappointed by this book. The lack of adequate source citation is frustrating and the author's initial research methodology (writing letters to newspapers, universities, and historical societies throughout the South asking if they knew of a Samuel Postlethwaite) is inefficient. A quick check of the <i>Consolidated Index to Compiled Service Records of Confederate Soldiers</i>, available on microfilm, would have shown that the sole Samuel Postlethwaite who served in the Confederate military was in the 21st Mississippi Infantry. <p>The claim that Postlethwaite is the only Confederate known to be buried in Rhode Island is erroneous. Numerous Confederates living in Rhode Island, several of whom are also buried there, are accidentally listed among the Union veterans and widows enumerated in the 1890 <i>Special Schedules of the Eleventh Census</i>. Albert W. Babcock stated he was a Confederate postmaster in Florida and a blockade runner. He is buried in Swan Point Cemetery, the same cemetery where some of Postlethwaite's relatives are buried.<p>Additional errors of fact are readily apparent. Rolston described Elmer Ellsworth as being killed for lowering a Confederate flag over Washington, D.C., when he actually was killed in Alexandria, Virginia, on the day Union troops captured that city. Kanawha, according to Rolston, entered statehood as West Virginia at the time of Virginia's secession in 1861, when in fact West Virginia did not become a state until 1863. What connection Samuel Postlethwaite's military service had with Ellsworth or Kanawha, or even the resignation of General Winfield Scott, eludes this reviewer.<p>Unfortunately, Rolston offers nothing new, with the exception of family letters and papers. The inclusion of numerous general discussions of the War distracts readers from the more interesting part of the book: the story of Samuel Postlethwaite and his kin. Greater concentration on the Postlethwaite family, their interactions with their Northern relatives after the War, and the author's efforts to ensure a proper marking of Sam's final resting place would have made for a more readable and useful biography.<p><i>Craig R.

2083	811729125		Reliving the Civil War: A Reenactor's Handbook, Second Edition	Reliving the Civil War: A Reenactor's Handbook, Second Edition	Hadden, R. Lee			"Several years ago I received a copy of the first edition of this book as a present from a non-reenactor friend. Having seen several earlier books and videos by earnest folks trying to explain reenacting to newcomers, I could only shake my head wondering what these guys had missed or gotten wrong. As it turned out, I was the one who was mistaken.<p>Having been an infantry reenactor since the mid-'70s, I was confident that I pretty much ""knew it all."" So I was surprised at what I found within the pages of R. Lee Hadden's book. This guide tells you everything you need to reenact the role of an infantryman in the Civil War. A person or small group of people wishing to take up the hobby can do it using just the information presented in <b>Reliving the Civil War.</b><p>There is nothing lacking here. The section on ""Reenactment for Infantry"" covers the usual items -- from uniforms and equipment to tobacco, medals, and military courtesy. ""Camp Life"" includes not just the military camp, but also civilian, sutler, and support camps. Hadden does not avoid touchy issues such as women in uniform. And he discusses rationally, unlike others I have heard, the different groups within the reenactment community. <p>The issues between casual reenactors and the hard-core ""authentics"" are addressed appropriately.Other chapters are devoted to ""Reenacting Etiquette,"" ""Health and Comfort"" (remember it is <i>living</i> history, folks!), and ""Hosting a Civil War Reenactment.""<p>The second edition includes expanded coverage of trends within the reenactment community, including roles for men, women, and children (yes, gentlemen, women do have a role in reenactments!), updated appendices (including Web site and e-mail addresses), and a new index with subject headings.<p><b>Reliving the Civil War</b> does an excellent job of covering the infantry, and even has a large section for civilians. It does not cover artillery or cavalry very well (but these topics would require a book of their own to do them justice). And it must be said that, compared with infantry reenactment, artillery or cavalry reenactments attract smaller numbers of reenacters and involve a lot more expense.<p>At the end of the book are nine very useful appendices, such as: ""National Park Service Safety and Standards,"" ""Antietam National Battlefield Rifle-Musket Misfire Plan,"" ""Reenactors and Taxes,"" and even ""Reenacting Periodicals."" Each is a gem of information in itself.<p>I highly recommend <b>Reliving the Civil War</b> as a <i>must have</i> for anyone thinking of getting into reenactment, as well as for those who are already involved.<p><i>Dave Arneson first began reenacting in 1976 with the 1st Minnesota Volunteer Infantry.

1805	783501005		The Civil War: A Narrative (40th Anniversary Edition)	Civil War: A Narrative (40th Anniversary Edition) The	Foote, Shelby			"Shelby Foote, the Mississippi-born, currently Tennessee-based novelist and historian became something of a celebrity after his appearances in Ken Burns's PBS television series, The Civil War. Foote was enlisted as a narrator because of his exhaustive knowledge of the subject and his reputation as historian extraordinaire, which he secured from the publication of his monumental three-volume work <b>The Civil War: A Narrative</b>.<p>Now Time-Life Books is issuing a 14-volume 40th anniversary edition, illustrated with historical photographs, battle maps, drawings, paintings, and other works of art culled from Time-Life's collection. This is, of course, not the first time a photo narrative of the Civil War has been published. Francis T. Miller's famous ten-volume work, The Photographic History of the Civil War (1912), was reissued in 1987, sadly with poor quality halftone reproductions. Ken Burns's companion volume to his PBS series is wonderfully illustrated with period photographs, battle maps, paintings, etc. Yet <b>The Civil War: A Narrative</b> offers a unique charm.<p>Foote has written a very informative introduction to the first volume, giving details of the genesis of his book, especially of his relationship to Random House publisher Bennett Cerf (who originally had commissioned a single volume to be titled <i>A Short History of the Civil War</i>). Our author's passion toward his subject produced a work seven times larger than originally planned. The completed text consisted of three volumes, released in 1958, 1963, and 1974, respectively. A predecessor to this edition, brought out in 1991, was a sumptuous three-volume, limited, signed, ""Collector's Edition, Bound in Genuine Leather"" reissue by the Easton Press, which was published in a red morocco gilt-stamped leather binding.<p>The binding of this 40th anniversary collector's edition is of a nice oatmeal-colored paper, with the illustrated dust jackets of the 14 volumes collectively forming a photograph of a Federal infantry drill at a Washington, D.C., camp in early 1862. Foote has written a prologue and epilogue for each book. Foote's approach to the War is weighted toward military matters, although the politics of the conflict are addressed in the process. He deals with the Union and the Confederacy, in both Eastern and Western theaters of the War. The author's literary background makes reading this work so enjoyable, featuring as it does a flowing pace like that of a good novel.<p>The first volume covers the prelude to the War, notably the perspectives of Presidents Jefferson Davis and Abraham Lincoln, and takes note of the major events of the first ten months, especially the conflicts at Fort Sumter and Manassas. The second volume deals with the first six months of 1862, with special emphasis on Shiloh, the assaults on New Orleans and Memphis, and the famed battle between the <i>Monitor</i> and the <i>Merrimac</i>. In volume three, Foote focuses on the events of the spring and early summer of 1862, including the campaigns of Stonewall Jackson and George McClellan, activities in the West, and Braxton Bragg's move to Chattanooga. Volume four gives attention to the Second Manassas, the subsequent Confederate invasions of the Northern territories, and Kirby Smith's invasion of Kentucky, with events leading up to the Emancipation Proclamation. In volume five, Foote recounts events of late 1862 and early 1863, with special attention to the battles of Fredericksburg, Walnut Hills, and Murfreesboro, plus Ulysses Grant's bayou ventures.<p>In addition to the prologues and epilogues which Foote has written expressly for the edition, the inclusion of illustrations distinguishes this Time-Life series from earlier printings.<p>As a photographic historian, I am always interested in seeing how illustrations -- photographs or not -- are incorporated into a book, especially when the book deals with one subject matter. In examining the first five volumes, I find that there has been a judicious choice of photographs, maps, lithographs, and sketches. Both the black-and-white and color reproductions are very good. Proper crediting of the illustrations' ownership is given at the back of each volume. Many are from the great Meserve Collection and The Library of Congress. However, in not one instance did I notice a credit of the original photographer or artist, although in some cases the photographer of the copy print is given credit (which could mislead some people to think that the credited person was the maker of the original picture). Therein lies a problem with this 40th anniversary edition of Foote's work. It is unclear whether it was caused by a lack of information or a lack of knowledge about where to find such information.<p>Aside from that one failing, this 40th anniversary edition is an enjoyable read and a visual delight, whether one is reading it for the first time or once again.<p><i>Michl Hargraves has served for 12 years as a cataloguer in the Department of Photographs at the J.

1969	1558537147		Friendly Fire in the Civil War	Friendly Fire in the Civil War	Garrison, Webb			"Soldiers accidentally killing their comrades in combat has been an unfortunate and often under-represented aspect of nearly every war. The Civil War is no exception. In <b>Friendly Fire in the Civil War</b>, Webb Garrison chronicles incidents of friendly fire in over 100 Civil War battles.<p>Written in a style that will appeal to most Civil War enthusiasts, Garrison's exploration of friendly fire is both informative and readable. This unique work examines not only the Civil War's famous cases of friendly fire (for example, the mortal wounding of Confederate General Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson during the Battle of Chancellorsville), but also little known episodes of men in the same army killing each other.<p>The author examined scores of diaries and memoirs to uncover instances of friendly fire. His research shows that from the smallest skirmish to the largest battlefield, the Civil War saw an astounding number of friendly fire incidents.<p>While Garrison writes that on occasion confusion, excitement, and obstructed views led to many episodes of misdirected attacks, he argues that better training, discipline, and leadership would have significantly lowered the number of these lamentable incidents. In the case of Jackson's wounding, Garrison describes how Major John Barry of the 18th North Carolina ordered his men to shoot, despite General A. P. Hill's shouting that they were hitting comrades.<p>Garrison also argues that with victory as the only goal for Yankees and Rebels alike, officers spent little time contemplating or correcting actions they considered minor in comparison to the overall carnage seen in the Civil War. Some officers even became calloused to causing the injury or death of their comrades. In one case, Union General William ""Bull"" Nelson ordered the pilot of a steamship that was transporting Nelson's Ohio Volunteers to Pittsburg Landing to plow full speed through a mass of blue clad men who, after being defeated around the Shiloh Church, were attempting to swim across the Tennessee River to safety.<p>Though some of Garrison's examples may not rise to the level of friendly fire -- for instance, injury caused by wooden sabots falling off artillery shells and landing among allies -- his study sheds light on a little known, yet disturbingly prevalent, aspect of America's Civil War.<p><i>E.

2200	700610405		States' Rights and the Union: Imperium in Imperio, 1776-1876		McDonald, Forrest			States' rights have been an American leitmotif since colonial withdrawal from Great Britain. Forrest McDonald, Distinguished Research Professor of History at the University of Alabama, appreciates this tradition, as <b>States' Rights and the Union</b> attests. <p> McDonald examines the evolution of states' rights vis-a-vis the problem of divided sovereignty, as indicated by his subtitle. The Constitution elated neither nationalists nor Antifederalists with its mixed republican design, begetting philosophic rivalry that developed into sectional enmity. Viewed in this context, the Civil War was the culmination of a foundational tension. Since divided sovereignty and states' rights are intertwined, it is therefore parochial to dismiss states' rights as a contrivance of the slavocracy. <p> The analysis McDonald presents is refreshing in several respects. He treats the organic law that emerged from the 1861 Montgomery convention as a serious exercise in constitutionalism, rather than as a Rebel appropriation of the United States Constitution that differed only with regard to slavery. Noted is the Confederate Constitution's strengthening of state sovereignty, including the modified amendment and impeachment processes. McDonald also calls attention to substantive executive and legislative alterations. Thus, while slavery occasioned secession, the Confederate polity did not derive its premises solely from a tyrannical social order. <p> Another valuable feature is McDonald's examination of how states' rights fared during the war, especially within the Union government. While Jefferson Davis's centralizing policies (conscription, habeas corpus suspension, etc.) are often cited to invalidate the Confederacy, Lincoln's cultivation of federal-executive primacy is relatively overlooked. McDonald gives an excellent account of how Lincoln achieved astonishing centralization through an elastic interpretation of his powers as commander in chief. <p> The pages on Reconstruction present congressional emasculation of states' rights and their partial reinvigoration by the Supreme Court. McDonald notably discusses the problematic underpinnings of the Fourteenth Amendment, the legitimacy of which goes all but unquestioned in our day. Given the historical and jurisprudential prestige of the Reconstruction amendments, this part of <b>States' Rights and the Union</b> will likely prove to be its most provocative content. <p> Even this superb study could have been enhanced. For instance, a consideration of Jefferson Davis's antebellum invocation of the Tenth Amendment to legitimate secession would have been germane. Notwithstanding such omission, Forrest McDonald once again shows himself to be the premier constitutional historian of our era in this much-needed and lucid book. <p>  <i>A columnist for the news site LewRockwell.com, Myles Kantor (mbkantor@aol.com) writes from Boynton Beach, Florida.</i>	Kantor, Myles	Spring 2001	2001-03-01	Review	Federalism's tension between nation and states produced sectional enmity	Divided government	University Press of Kansas	36800				"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=251 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/McDonaldStates'RightsandtheUnion.jpg"">"

1397	807123471		Jottings from Dixie: The Civil War Dispatches of Sergeant Major Stephen F. Fleharty, U.S.A.		Reyburn, Philip J.	Wilson, Terry L.		Stephen F. Fleharty compiled a detailed and thoughtful chronicle of his unit's history during the Civil War by writing 55 letters to two newspapers in Rock Island, Illinois. Born in that state, of Irish ancestry, Fleharty began his letters in August 1862, right after the 102nd Illinois was organized, and continued writing until September 1864. The letters were the basis of a unit history he wrote immediately after the war ended. They have now been collected, edited, and published.<p>Fleharty came to be a correspondent honestly, for he worked as a printer in Galesburg, Illinois, before the war. The 102nd Illinois was organized in the late summer of 1862. It participated in the pursuit of Bragg's army in Kentucky that fall but saw no action at the battle of Perryville. The regiment performed garrison duty in various railroad towns in Tennessee for a long time after that. <p>It did not see action until the Atlanta campaign, where it served in the 20th Corps of the Army of the Cumberland. The engagement at Resaca was its first and costliest action. The 102nd Illinois continued to campaign throughout Sherman's drive to Atlanta; indeed, Fleharty's last letter announces the fall of the city. It participated in the March to the Sea and through the Carolinas, but these campaigns are not covered in this book, as Fleharty stopped writing for the press. He continued to serve faithfully to the end of the war, and some of his personal letters are incorporated by the authors into their introduction.<p>The book is thoroughly researched and illuminates all aspects of the letters and especially of Fleharty's life before, during, and after the war. The sergeant major was among the more literate of soldiers. He had a good eye for the interesting travelogue and often visited sites of natural beauty and history when not on duty. Fleharty provides an excellent description of the Stones River battlefield nine months after the fight there. Also, he describes traveling on the Mississippi River and the Vicksburg siege lines. His insights into soldiering during the Atlanta campaign are useful and interesting. In fact, one wishes he would have participated in more active campaigning for that reason. All in all, this is a good addition to any Civil War shelf.<p><i>Earl J.

1918	823219712		A Grand Terrible Dramma<br> From Gettysburg to Petersburg:<br> The Civil War Letters of Charles Wellington Reed		Campbell, Eric A.			"Students of history should always welcome the publication of letters and diaries, and praise the editors and publishers who make these primary sources available. The letters of Private Charles Reed, 9th Massachusetts (Bigelow's) Battery, which are collected in <b>""A Grand Terrible Dramma,""</b> are not exactly a hidden treasure of information on life in the Army of the Potomac. But, as Reed himself would confess, it is not his letters that deserve top billing. Editor Eric A. Campbell, a ranger-historian at Gettysburg National Military Park, understates his case when he points out that Reed's 250 drawings of camp life and campaigning are an integral part of the narrative and that Reed has been neglected inexplicably as an artistic chronicler of the war. <p> Reed was a soldier-artist whose wartime ""scetches"" (as he dubbed them) appeared in <i>Battles and Leaders of the Civil War</i> and were featured in his comrade John D. Billings's classic work <i>Hardtack and Coffee</i>. In fact, considering that Reed's artistic  renderings were sold as lithographs during the war, it might be more accurate to describe the young bugler as an artist-soldier, for he seemed to devote more attention and energy to depicting soldiering than to actually doing it. In November 1864, Reed's avocation won him a position as assistant topographical engineer, and he spent the rest of the war sketching for the army and for himself. <p> The early letters found in this selection reveal a man who was obsessed with obtaining proper sketchbooks and pencils, executing sketches for the captain, and sending full books home to his mother. During the last two years, Reed turned entrepreneur with a vengeance. Unfortunately, his subject-the war-became a hindrance to his chosen profession. ""I can do nothing about them [plates of a review] until this affair is over,"" he wrote his mother on May 13, 1864 from Spotsylvania. He spent much of the Petersburg campaign wandering the camps ""collecting my dues"" for several lithographs, including a famous topographical map of the Gettysburg battlefield. ""I am going to make some money out of this,"" he wrote his mother in March 1865. Indeed, he sometimes sent home as much as $200 at a time. <p> Important as the illustrations are, Campbell understandably trumpets the significance of Reed's accounts of Gettysburg (his first battle), though Reed failed to recount his dramatic battlefield rescue of battery commander John Bigelow-the incident for which he was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor 30 years after the war. He was more lavish in his descriptions of muddy winter encampments around Washington, Brandy Station, and Petersburg, and of the army's movements during the 1864 Overland campaign. <p> But creating and selling his drawings clearly defined Reed's wartime experience and appropriately dominate this book. It is, therefore, unfortunate that editor and publisher did not treat the book as a catalogue, and offer dimensions of original works, notes on which works were published previously, and at least occasional full-page plates. <p> <i>John M. Coski is historian and library director of the Museum of the Confederacy.

2034	966946405		California in the War for Southern Independence	California in the War for Southern Independence	Talbott, Laurence Fletcher			"Studies of Civil War history relative to the Trans-Mississippi West are not as extensive as for other regions of the United States. California particularly is neglected, at least in book-length treatments as Laurence Talbott asserts in <b>California in the War for Southern Independence</b>. Talbott goes on to contend the Union side of the story has been ""well recorded"" while the history of those who supported the Confederacy has received ""only fleeting, and often hostile recognition.""<p>Nor does he see this topic as parochial in scope in that he paints California as a ""microcosm of the United States in political and cultural diversity."" Carrying on his interest in broader themes, Talbott makes an argument that California was a border state. Most importantly, he maintains: ""There was a large minority of Californians who would have been glad to see California join the Southern Confederacy, or secede from the Union, and form a separate Pacific Republic. . . ."" The author qualifies this last thesis by noting that the large pro-Confederate minority ""lived mostly, but not entirely, in Southern California,"" yet elsewhere he asserts ""enclaves of Southern Sympathy were ubiquitous."" <p>To demonstrate this alleged strong Southern proclivity, he spends nearly one-third of the volume on a series of brief biographies focusing on six key individuals who elected to depart California to serve the Confederacy. The most notable of this group was Albert Sidney Johnston. While interesting, these biographies do little to carry forward the author's contentions.<p>The remaining chapters of the monograph are left to demonstrate his theory that a ""large majority of people were held in check . . . waiting in vain for their army of liberation to cross the Colorado and grasp their waiting hands. . . ."" To this end he cites statistics that three-eighths of the state's population supported secession, while indeed ""there were 16,000 Knights of the Golden Circle"" who were well organized and ""all full of hate for the Union."" If these figures were true, why did the pro-Southerners not organize and strike against the 16,000 federal volunteers in the Golden State?<p>Here the author's use of <i>The Official Records of the War of the Rebellion</i> as his sole evidence for these statistics comes into question. Indeed, the ORs represent the major primary source cited by the author. In the main he relies heavily on secondary references. Even then, some of the cited works are poorly researched. Further, certain key secondary sources have been ignored or glossed over. <p>Thus, the book is a synthesis drawn almost entirely from published materials. Given this fact, and the high cost of what is a modest 5"" x 8"" work with flimsy pulp covers, this book probably is destined to be purchased by only the most dedicated Civil War bibliophiles.<p><i>John P.

As he says, ""The Hunley, for all the justifiable attention she has received, was but one of perhaps two dozen underwater boats constructed during the conflict by both sides."" <p>Although the U.S. Navy and Patent Office received many proposals for Union submarines, mostly hare-brained, only one, the <i>U.S.S. Alligator</i>, was built and got anywhere near the enemy. This manually propelled, 100-foot-long craft was intended to help counter the iron clad <i>C.S.S. Virginia</i> (Merrimac) but was found unsuitable. It sank ingloriously while being towed to Charleston a year later. <p>Submarines made more sense for the Confederates than for the Federals. In theory, they could remain safely under the protection of coastal forts and sneak out at night to attach ""torpedoes"" (really nautical mines) to the hulls of blockading ships. Another proposed early tactic was for the sub to tow a torpedo attached to a board, dive under the target vessel, and allow the torpedo to strike the other side. This worked only in practice runs. <p>The more reliable device was a spar projecting from the bow of the sub and tipped with a torpedo. After impaling the device in the target's hull, the sub was supposed to back away to a safe distance and then set off the charge by electricity. Presumably that is what the <i>Hunley</i> did in the only successful sub attack of the war. <p>Some proposals for subs were far ahead of their time, most notably air-purification systems, electro-magnetic motors, periscopes, and even snorkels. In the end, however, only manually operated propellers proved even marginally practical.<p>Ragan's job of research was as daunting as it is impressive. Many of the Confederate records were destroyed by fire in the fall of Richmond. He had to scour through company records, newspaper accounts, and personal correspondence to produce this brilliant, definitive work on a little-known aspect of the endlessly fascinating Civil War.<p><i>Robert H.

1839	873386418		Sounding the Shallows: A Confederate Compendium for the Maryland Campaign of 1862		Harsh, Joseph L.			The award-winning <i>Taken at the Flood: Robert E. Lee & Confederate Strategy in the Maryland Campaign of 1862</i> did not exhaust Joseph L. Harsh's thoughts concerning those fateful days in September. If doubts existed in, or about, Harsh's analysis of the events, readers are provided extraordinary insight into the author's mind in <b>Sounding the Shallows</b>, the companion volume to <i>Taken at the Flood</i>. <p>  The book invites readers to see explicitly how an author comes to his conclusions. Scholars will find it a useful template for how an author may create a framework for analysis. Although significant to the study of the Maryland campaign, <b>Sounding the Shallows</b> is more important as a basis for educated, informed, and objective historical interpretation. In this giant endnote, the reader will join the author in laying out fully and clearly the bases for his interpretations. <p> Through a wide array of tables and analysis dealing with almost every aspect of possible controversy, Harsh penetrates into the combat experience of Confederate troops, their organization, and their deployment - before, during, and after the engagements. Among the details included is information on unit commanders' fates in the campaign. And, drawing from the Eighth U.S. Census and other sources, he is able to explain the conditions of the field and the people who lived there. <p> A set of nearly 100 research appendices deals with Lee's decision to enter Maryland, the battles of South Mountain and Harper's Ferry, Antietam, and the aftermath. The topics include such matters as weather, the impact of straggling on the Confederate army, Lee's injury before the crossing into Maryland, the placement of supply trains, the activities of specific units and their accomplishments, the impact of the loss of Special Order No. 191 and accounting for the lost copies, and exactly when Lee met with whom when. <p> Critical to the study of any event are the recollections of the participants afterward, in some cases decades later. Harsh's comparative study of the remembrances of these soldiers is detailed and exhaustive. He is especially critical of the memory of John G. Walker and the discrepancies in his writings following the War. He demonstrates that Walker is often not credible as a witness in much of what he writes about. <p> In order to understand the full import of the analysis contained in <b>Sounding the Shallows</b>, the reader must digest <i>Taken at the Flood</i>. Hardly a problem, since a serious student of the Civil War should miss neither. <p><i>Craig R.

1587	737301597		Draw History: Civil War	Draw History: Civil War	Clayton, Nancy	Spellman, Susan		"The collaboration of writer Nancy Clayton and illustrator Susan Spellman has resulted in <b>Draw History: Civil War</b>, a noteworthy book that combines historical facts with step-by-step art lessons. <p>Clayton, whose writing progresses smoothly from the first to the last page, slips at times into the voice of a practiced storyteller. In perfect parallel, the handsome illustrations provided by the highly published artist, Spellman, lend balance to Clayton's text.<p>The combination of art and history works so well that young readers initially interested in the text will be encouraged to pick up their pencils and sketch, while young artists initially interested in the artwork likely will be encouraged to put down their pencils and read. <b>Draw History</b> offers a useful tool for educators who wish to integrate art and history lessons into a cross-curriculum program.<p>The book is divided into six sections; each offers clear instructions for drawing figures and objects associated with the Civil War and includes lucid histories of the items.<p>For example, in the ""Transportation"" section, the steps for drawing Robert E. Lee's favorite horse, Traveller, are coupled with stories such as the day the horse saved Lee's life. Clayton writes: ""After the war, General Lee wrote a special description of Traveller for an artist who wanted to paint [Lee with his horse], saying, If I were an artist like you, I would draw Traveller with fine proportions and quick eye to describe his endurance of the dangers through which he passed.'"" Keeping those words in mind and studying Spellman's instructions, a young artist could reproduce such a horse with ""fine proportions and quick eye.""<p>The first section of the book, titled ""Buildings and Places,"" requires nothing more than a ruler to complete drawings of typical buildings, bridges, and towers. In particular, the pages devoted to the famous Beanpole Bridge will surely interest readers.<p>The remaining five sections seem to lean on the premise that someone who can draw an oval, square, and triangle can draw anything. These sections are titled: ""The Big Guns,"" ""Transportation,"" ""War on the Water,"" ""People,"" and ""An Animal."" Included are subjects such as: the battlefield cannon, the Napoleon; Lincoln's funeral train engine, the Nashville; the ""Ghost Ship"" <i>Alabama</i>; various soldiers, sailors, and officers of the Union and Confederacy; and Sallie, the courageous mascot of the 11th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment.

1422	195120620		Jefferson Davis's Generals	Jefferson Davis's Generals	Boritt, Gabor S.			"The eight essays included in <b>Jefferson Davis's Generals</b> stem from papers written by various authors and presented to the editor's Civil War Institute at Gettysburg. Five of the papers discuss relations between commander in chief Davis and some of his full generals: J.E. Johnston, R.E. Lee, Beauregard, Bragg, and Hood; one deals with the wives of all these except Hood; another concerns pictures of Davis in the Northern press; and the last addresses broad questions of strategy and history. Although each essay is followed by endnotes and a bibliographic essay, there is no index for the collection.<p>Craig L. Symonds's essay treats coolly the hot topic of his subtitle's double entendre: ""Davis and Johnston at War."" The two men, so much alike, clashed repeatedly until Davis finally wrote out for Congress, but never sent, his explanation of why he could not again give Johnston charge of an army. In a balanced, careful assessment, Symonds awards the palm for valor in this ""war"" to Davis, but perhaps overstates the case in calling this ""dysfunctional partnership"" a major cause of defeat.<p>In Emory M. Thomas's paper, Thomas states that the Confederate president, and historians after him, ""believed that Lee and Davis were in strategic accord when, in fact, they were not."" Davis wanted defense while Lee wanted ""climactic battle."" Conceding that ""Lee never spoke or wrote his heresy,"" Thomas seeks proof in Lee's two invasions of the North. But he fails to note that Davis approved both campaigns, and that it was Beauregard, not Davis, who refused to supply the diversion Lee wanted in 1863 (and for good reasons: insufficient troops and an impending attack on Charleston).<p>T. Michl Parrish's contribution to <b>Jefferson Davis's Generals</b> points out that Beauregard thought up grand strategies that President Davis never adopted -- one cause of the friction between the two men. Parrish treats their ""animus"" evenhandedly, pointing out that Davis put the general in the right niche at Charleston and that the two were able to smother their feelings for the good of the Cause they both loved. Parrish's crystal clear style helps to make this essay a gem.<p>Steven E. Woodworth's essay blames Davis for, of all things, not supporting Braxton Bragg -- failing to provide ""a sound command system along with good officers."" Whether or not this makes Davis liable for Bragg's failures, we at least learn that the two were not special friends. Some assertions in this essay seem dubious, but reading that Bragg was a good general with ""genuine talent"" whose subordinates did indeed sometimes fail him is a refreshing change.<p>Herman Hattaway's paper expertly discusses many aspects of John Bell Hood's rise to a top command and his friendship of mutual admiration with Davis. Mostly Hattaway is right on target, showing that Hood deserved promotions for his battlefield performance but did not know how to manage an entire army. Hattaway dismisses the idea that Hood was a ""spy"" for Davis. The essay seems to accept, however, the widespread but erroneous notion that Davis approved Hood's fatal move to Nashville.<p>In a happy shift of gaze to women, <b>Jefferson Davis's Generals</b> presents an essay by Lesley J. Gordon. Gordon shows Varina Davis, Lydia Johnston, and Elise Bragg with devoted husbands, in contrast to Caroline Beauregard, whose husband neglected her. Greater acquaintance with the Lees' circumstances might have sweetened the author's view of Robert and Mary. The other portraits in Gordon's contribution, except for a few errors, are well done and true to life.<p>Harold Holzer's piece uses illustrations to trace the printed image of Davis in the Northern press, from military president to traitor to buffoon, and then later -- in an ""iconographic miracle"" -- to restored hero. Davis never wore the Confederate uniform that some prints put on him, Holzer says, but he was always ""the living symbol"" of the Confederacy and the Lost Cause.<p>James M. McPherson's work gives a brilliant analysis of strategy, puts the War in the broad context of history, and then takes up particular points, even clearing muddy ones presented in the book's other essays. In the face of Southern soul-searching, he ends on a novel note: maybe the Yankee army had something to do with the Confederate defeat.<p>With its varied topics, viewpoints, and styles, this collection of essays will interest scholar and non-scholar alike.<p><i>Felicity Allen lives in Auburn, Alabama.

1971	684824353		A Brotherhood of Valor: The Common Soldiers of the Stonewall Brigade, C.S.A., and the Iron Brigade, U.S.A.	Brotherhood of Valor: The Common Soldiers of the Stonewall Brigade, C.S.A., and the Iron Brigade, U.S.A. A	Wert, Jeffry D.			The fascination with Civil War soldiering continues to run wide and deep in American society. Evidence for this fact can be found in the popularity of Civil War films, television shows, histories, novels, and games, and by the numbers of Americans who spend their free time recreating Civil War battles and camp life. This great interest is not surprising, for the spectacle of tens of thousands of men marching into combat time after time when they knew that a quarter or more might suffer death or maiming wounds is indeed compelling.<p><b>A Brotherhood of Valor</b> tells the story of two groups of men who achieved remarkable combat records and who seemed to epitomize much that was best in the armies of both sides. With considerable narrative skill, Jeffry D. Wert follows the often intertwined fortunes of the Confederacy's Stonewall Brigade and the Union's Iron Brigade, beginning with the naive enthusiasm of the volunteers in the first days of the war and ending with their near destruction as viable units. <p>Based on records left behind by both sides<p>Though Wert inevitably follows the same paths as earlier histories, such as Alfred T. Nolan's <i>The Iron Brigade</i>, his work is solidly based on the large number of records left behind by the men on both sides. Wert handles these sources with an expert touch, ensuring that the voices of the common soldiers remain predominant throughout his work.<p>The Virginia regiments that came to make up the Stonewall Brigade, the 2nd, 4th, 5th, 27th, and 33rd, were all drawn largely from central Virginia, and they brought to the war a common desire to defend their beloved homeland. The Iron Brigade was a more diverse unit, constructed from the 2nd, 6th, and 7th Wisconsin, the 19th Indiana, and later the 24th Michigan. At the same time, their status as the only brigade in the Army of the Potomac made up entirely from Western regiments set them apart.<p>Despite their differences, the two brigades shared a number of common characteristics and experiences. Both served under exacting commanders who deliberately shaped them into elite units. General Thomas Jackson was a stern, intense man who drove his men, and himself, to their very limits in his consuming desire to defeat the enemy. In the beginning, many in the brigade resented his seemingly inhuman demands and considered him reckless, even mad. But in time many of the same men came to trust Jackson implicitly, to believe in his invincibility, and to take pride in their shared victories and shared name. <p>General John Gibbon, likewise, was a sober man who expected his volunteers to measure up to the highest standards of the Regular Army in drill, behavior, and dress. Initially many of the Western volunteers found him fussy and unreasonable, but eventually they, too, came to understand that the long hours of drill and stern discipline translated into superior combat performance. Gibbon also gave the Iron Brigade a powerful sense of identity by issuing them the Regular Army tall black hat and feather rather than the common blue cap. The headgear made the brigade clearly identifiable on the battlefield and became a badge of excellence.<p>But it was the experience of combat that ultimately transformed volunteers into elite troops. The Stonewall Brigade won their name in the first major battle in the East, when they halted the Union advance at Henry House Hill and contributed decisively to the Confederate victory. They solidified their reputation as one of the Confederacy's hardest marching, hardest fighting units in Jackson's valley operations in the winter of 1861-1862 and by their superior performance at the battles of Fredericksburg, Antietam, and Chancellorsville. Similarly, the Iron Brigade won lasting fame by their remarkable assaults on the Confederate lines at Brawner's House and South Mountain, their refusal to give way in the vicious fighting in the Cornfield at Antietam, and their stubborn, crucial defense of McPherson's Ridge the first day of Gettysburg.<p>High rates of absenteeism and desertion<p>Though Wert pays respectful tribute to the courage and fortitude of these units, he does not romanticize the war. He concedes that the Stonewall Brigade suffered shamefully high rates of absenteeism and desertion, particularly when stationed near home. He admits that men on both sides grumbled about the routines of camp life, shirked drill, occasionally stole from civilians, and engaged in drunken brawls. <p>Further, Wert fully demonstrates the grim cost that these units incurred in winning their reputations. The Iron Brigade recorded more combat deaths than any other brigade in the entire war and suffered casualty rates of over 30 percent in several encounters. Indeed, the brigade never recovered from its losses at Gettysburg, and on the first day of the Battle of the Wilderness it would break and run. Likewise, by May 1864 the Stonewall Brigade, once 8,100 strong, had shrunk to 200 men, and it would suffer the ignominy of losing both its brigade designation and its name.<p>Readers looking for a sociological study of Civil War units, a psychological consideration of responses to combat, or a rigorous analysis of the reasons for superior combat performance will not find them here. Rather, what Wert offers is an affectionate account of two groups of ordinary men who achieved extraordinary things. Wert leaves the reader with a profound sense of the soldiers' common experiences, of camp life, drill, the sometimes inexplicable demands of officers, hunger, exhaustion, fear, rage, comradeship, and above all combat, that transcended boundaries of North and South and bound these men together in a brotherhood of valor.<p><i>Noel Fisher is author of </i>War at Every Door: Partisan Politics and Guerrilla Violence in East Tennessee, 1860-1869.<i> He received his Ph.D. from Ohio State University and lives in Columbus, Ohio.</i>	Fisher, Noel	Summer 1999	1999-06-01	Review	Two celebrated units were forged in the cauldron of battle	Feather in their caps	Simon & Schuster	0000-00-00				"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=245 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/WertBrotherhoodValor.jpg"">"

2048	803225822		Abraham Lincoln and a New Birth of Freedom: The Union & Slavery in the Diplomacy of the Civil War	Abraham Lincoln and a New Birth of Freedom: The Union & Slavery in the Diplomacy of the Civil War	Jones, Howard			"The focus of this slim but important volume, Howard Jones states, is ""on the integral relationship of the Union and slavery to the crisis over foreign intervention."" By describing the shifting diplomatic strategies of the Union, the Confederacy, and the chief European powers, Britain and France, Jones persuasively demonstrates that slavery lay at the center of virtually all the crucial debates over intervention, and that the war on the foreign front played a major role in determining the outcome at home.<p>As the title suggests, Abraham Lincoln was the central player in the drama. As deeply principled as he was pragmatic, Lincoln hated slavery, had always done so, and he understood that the slavery issue was the main cause of the War. But to retain his bipartisan war effort and the loyalty of the border slave states, Lincoln initially insisted that his sole purpose was to preserve the Union. He expected Britain and France, with their anti-slavery sensibilities, to understand that slavery was indeed the great issue in the contest and to refrain from intervention.<p>Yet with Washington and Richmond both downplaying slavery, British and French leaders felt free to act on self-interest. Driven by their need for cotton and a desire to curtail the United States, the two governments granted the Confederacy belligerent status and stood prepared, should the Confederacy prove itself invincible, to recognize it as a nation.<p>Such recognition, of course, would have been a catastrophe to the Union. As a member of the family of nations, the Confederacy would have been able to form alliances with the European powers, which might well have led to their direct involvement in the conflict. Had that happened, Jones writes, the Confederacy would have won the War.<p>Lincoln understood the danger. Determined to keep Britain and France out of the War, to remove its cause, and to forge a better Union, Lincoln issued his preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, announcing that on January 1, 1863, the eradication of slavery would become a Union war objective. But, as Jones shows, Lincoln's proclamation, instead of keeping Britain and France at bay, had the opposite effect. <p>Fearful that emancipation would provoke a slave uprising and lead to a wider war that imperiled Europe, the two countries came perilously close in the autumn of 1862 to a joint offer of mediation and ""de facto recognition"" of Confederate nationhood. It was, Jones asserts, the Union's greatest foreign crisis in the War. But it took place ""in the private chambers of Paris and London"" and was ""all unbeknown to American dignitaries"" there and in Washington. The crisis passed, however, when 1863 came, no slave revolt had occurred, and Lincoln issued his final Emancipation Proclamation, which imposed an ""inescapable moral tone"" on the War.<p>After that, the London government not only ""dropped all official talk of intervention,"" but also emphatically rejected a motion for recognition in the House of Commons. Any lingering notions of British intervention died with the Union's great victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg and with Lincoln's immortal address at Gettysburg, which, as Jones says, was ""so critical to defining the war's higher purpose.""<p>Meanwhile, French Emperor Napoleon III resolved to act alone in recognizing the Confederacy because his Grand Plan to establish monarchical rule and a new French empire in the Americas depended on an independent Confederacy. But Union Secretary of State Seward's repeated warning that intervention meant war with the French government forced the emperor to abandon his schemes regarding the Confederacy. By 1864, Jones states, ""the possibility of foreign intervention in the war had ceased to exist,"" and the Confederacy stood alone, unrecognized and doomed.<p>There are two problems I might note. Jones persistently refers to the Confederacy as ""the South,"" which is inaccurate, given that one southern state, Kentucky, and three other slave states remained in the Union. Jones also faults most studies of the Civil War for ""dwelling on battles and personalities."" By his own account, however, the War's crucial battles and the actions of the powerful personalities involved largely determined the course of diplomatic events. These complaints aside, the book deserves praise for giving us an astute, sophisticated analysis of a complex and often misunderstood story.<p><i>Stephen Oates taught history at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and is author of</i> The Whirlwind of War, With Malice Toward None: The Life of Abraham Lincoln, A Woman of Valor: Clara Barton and the Civil War<i>, and other works.

2193	1576070662		Encyclopedia of the American Civil War: A Political, Social, and Military History		Heidler, David S.	Gallagher, Gary W.	Neely, Mark E., Jr.	The formidable task of marshaling the resources and experts necessary to create a multi-volume Civil War reference work probably rivals the logistical demands of that conflict's greatest battles. Perhaps that explains why few comprehensive Civil War encyclopedias have made their way onto the scene. But now this conspicuous void has been filled. Editors David S. Heidler and Jeanne T. Heidler undertook the challenge of producing a work of encyclopedic scope, and the result is a 2,733-page <b>Encyclopedia of the American Civil War</b> that distinguishes itself as the most exhaustively researched resource to have come out since the <i>Encyclopedia of the Confederacy</i> (Simon & Schuster, 1993). <p> At the invitation of the Heidlers, highly accomplished Civil War historians such as Gary W. Gallagher, James I. Robertson, Jr., William C. Davis, and Charles P. Roland composed the encyclopedia's 1,600 entries. Military-related subjects predominate, but the editors also survey political and social aspects, achieving a judicious balance of topics. Biographies compose the majority of articles; the likes of Joseph Bailey, Edouard de Stoeckl, Barbara Frietschie, and countless other lesser-known figures are presented in addition to all the more famous ones. And battles from Antietam to Yellow Bayou are aptly treated, as are myriad other subjects, including acoustic shadows, bonds, and Italian-Americans. The entries reflect recent advances in scholarship and interpretation, and the editorial perspective throughout is evenhanded. <p> As purely a reference work, the encyclopedia admirably fulfills its duty of facilitating further research on the Civil War. Cross-references that accompany each article make textual navigation easy; short bibliographies following each entry provide the reader with relevant primary and secondary sources. A mammoth appendix and documents section fills the entire fifth volume, offering an eclectic trove of primary texts selected to cover all aspects of the war. The encyclopedia is capped off by a detailed chronology and a most generous bibliography and comprehensive index. <p> No work of this scope will be perfect, and more experienced historians may be perplexed by the excessive attention it sometimes gives to less decisive subjects. Biographies of many comparatively minor figures, for example, often garner as much or more space than do some articles for entire states. Smaller military engagements also are given inordinate space to the detriment of other, perhaps more important topics. Some of this unevenness probably can be attributed to the collaborative manner in which over 300 scholars contributed entries to the work. <p> With a price that matches the heft of its pages, this fine set may be more affordable for libraries and academic institutions than for individuals. Yet all those who purchase and use the encyclopedia are almost certain to be pleased and impressed. The five-volume set demonstrates how valuable reference tools of this kind can be. <p> The <b>Encyclopedia of the American Civil War</b> is essentially functional in design. It is not a splashy picture book destined for the coffee table-it is a research tool. Yes, ample pictures and maps supplement the text, but there are no fancy graphics, color photos, or glossy pages. And that is good, even if sadly the exception these days. It is pure substance. <p> <i>Charles L. McCollum assists with copyediting</i> CWBR. <i>He interviewed southern historian William J.

1866	1572491981		Mr. Lincoln's Bridge Builders: The Right Hand of American Genius		Thienel, Phillip M.			"The mission of combat engineers in today's army encompasses four tasks: mobility, counter-mobility, survivability, and general engineering. When undertaking offensive operations, engineers sustain mobility by ensuring that the force in the field can maneuver as its commander desires even in the face of restrictions imposed by terrain or enemy obstacles. Engineers performed the same role when this nation split and engaged in a bloody civil war. <p> In <b>Mr. Lincoln's Bridge Builders</b>, Phillip M. Thienel has done a very credible job describing how Union engineers provided their commanders the freedom needed to maneuver. The mobility engineering covered in the book involves a special art of the combat engineer, the float bridge. Well into the 1980s, the technology Thienel describes remained the basic process of bridge building used to support an attacking force. Though the materials of construction had changed, the bits and pieces making up the pontoon bridge of the 1860s would not be foreign to a soldier working on the M4T6 float bridge that, until quite recently, was the U.S. Army's front-line bridging. The soldiers of the 1970s could have talked to the soldiers of the Engineer Battalion of the Regular Army in terms of balks and stringers and each would have understood the other. <p> Not only has the bridging technology stayed the same, but the tactics of opposed river crossings have retained some of the basic tenets. Today army manuals speak of ""clearing the crossing site of observed fire"" before starting bridging operations. (That is making sure than the enemy force cannot fire on the bridge builders with rifles or machine guns, nor be allowed to observe and direct artillery fire on the bridge site.) Had the 50th New York Volunteer Engineer Regiment described in Thienel's book worked under such conditions, its bridging efforts at Fredericksburg would have enjoyed a more successful ending. <p> Thienel's work also touches on that other role of modern battlefield engineering: general engineering tasks. These are the engineer missions that most closely match the work done in civilian fields, such as the building of infrastructure to allow free movement of foodstuffs and supplies - ""the beans and bullets"" aspect of combat. <p> Every reviewer has his quibbles, and here are mine. First, too many foreign phrases are used without a translation in close proximity. Second, the work would have been enhanced with more maps to illustrate the movements of units and the development of battles. But these are minor inconveniences and certainly in no way should discourage anyone interested in the role of battlefield engineers from reading <b>Mr. Lincoln's Bridge Builders</b>.  <p> <i>William S. Gross, a colonel in the Army Reserves, commands the 493rd Engineer Group (Combat).</i>"	Gross, William S.

"The new series <i>In This Hallowed Ground: Guides to Civil Battlefields</i> started in 1998 with a guide to Gettysburg by Mark Grimsley and Brooks Simpson, two of the series editors. Now the third editor, Steven E. Woodworth, weighs in with his series contribution, which benefits greatly from his previous research on <i>Six Armies in Tennessee: The Chickamauga and Chattanooga Campaigns.</i><p>Serious military history buffs learn early on that one cannot completely understand a battle without understanding the battlefield. Reading alone, even by perceptive, insightful, and articulate authors, cannot provide as clear an understanding of a battle as walking the ground over which the soldiers fought.

I have visited Chickamauga and Chattanooga battlefields several times, always with a knowledgeable guide, and reading this book, I felt like I was almost doing it again.<p>Woodworth has divided the Chickamauga battlefield into 20 tour stops and seven ""optional excursions,"" and practically leads the reader by the hand through every stage of the battle, the Confederacy's greatest victory in the West. (He performs a similar service for Chattanooga -- seven stops and one optional excursion: the Missionary Ridge Walking Tour.)<p>The book begins with instructions on using the guide, and then proceeds to the introductory section, ""The Road to Chickamauga,"" which explains how the two armies got to this rolling countryside in north Georgia, barely south of the Tennessee line.<p>Each day begins with a succinct but thorough overview of that day's main developments, and then takes the reader through meticulous, often-checked driving and walking instructions to the various parts of the field in the order that the battle developed.<p>Each ""stop"" has a map, as well as the date and time of day, and offers Directions, Orientation, What Happened, and Analysis. At the completion of a particular stop (#20 -- Longstreet pushes north -- September 20, 1863, noon), the reader has as clear an understanding as the written word can provide. Photographs of the main commanders and period artwork decorate the guide, while adding to the mental images. <p>The Orders of Battle (a listing of all the units involved on both sides) and a general discussion of the operation of Civil War armies are found in the appendices.<p>If you can't actually go to Chickamauga-Chattanooga National Military Park, buy this book; if you can go, get this book before you visit!<p>And watch for other books in the series. <p><i>Jerry L.

1093	826212727		Missouri's Confederate: Claiborne Fox Jackson and the Creation of Southern Identity in the Border West		Phillips, Christopher			"The past few years have been highly enjoyable ones for anyone with an interest in the Trans-Mississippi Theater. Not only have outstanding studies of Richard Taylor, Nathaniel Lyon, Pea Ridge, and Wilson's Creek been published, but the exploits of William Clarke Quantrill's guerrillas have even attracted Hollywood's attention. Now, in <b>Missouri's Confederate</b>, Christopher Phillips offers the first book-length study of Claiborne Fox Jackson, who in 1861 did more than any other man to try to bring about Missouri's secession from the Union, but has been overshadowed by Sterling Price in the hearts and minds of neo-Confederate Missourians ever since. <p> The appearance of this study is long overdue. Not only were Jackson's life and political career interesting and important, but Phillips demonstrates that they also tell us much about the early history of Missouri. A native Kentuckian, Jackson emigrated to Missouri in 1827. There he attained financial success and social prominence thanks to a series of strategic marriages into the Sappington family of Missouri's Boon's Lick region. <p> He then went into politics as a stalwart supporter of hard money and Thomas Hart Benton, and became one of the most controversial and important leaders of the Democratic party in Missouri. After his efforts as governor to maneuver Missouri out of the Union were thwarted by Lyon and Frank Blair in 1861, Jackson established a government in exile that, before his death in December 1862, managed to enact a secession ordinance and secure recognition, but not much material support, from the Confederate Congress. <p> In <b>Missouri's Confederate</b>, Phillips offers an informative and painstakingly researched account of Jackson's life, and presents an intriguing analysis of Missouri society, politics, and culture before and during the Civil War. He persuasively demonstrates that Missourians came to develop a southern identity during the Middle Period and he shows how Jackson's endeavors (most prominently his turning against Benton when ""Old Bullion"" embraced free-soilism in the 1840s and his defiance of the Yankee invaders in 1861) both advanced and reflected Missouri's ""southernization."" <p> This is Civil War biography at its best. Balanced in its judgments, cogently argued, and superbly written, <b>Missouri's Confederate</b> sheds valuable light on how the Westerners who happened to be born in the South of Benton's Missouri became Southerners who happened to live in the West. <p><i>Ethan S.

1401	1559724625		Two American Presidents: A Dual Biography of Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis	Two American Presidents: A Dual Biography of Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis	Chadwick, Bruce			"The problems with <b>Two American Presidents</b> are so all-pervasive that no sort of detailed critique can be offered in this brief compass. Carelessness with facts abounds, whether simple misidentifications -- historian James Rabun appears as Rabin -- or misstatements such as repeatedly giving Davis five children instead of six and four sons rather than three. We are told that Davis grew his beard in 1861, despite several photographs from the 1850s that show the beard firmly in place.<p>Worse are the baseless exaggerations. Davis graduated only from West Point, yet is described as being ""one of the best educated men in America,"" and also as ""one of the richest men in the country,"" though his plantation actually belonged to his brother, Joseph, and more than once Davis toyed with leaving politics because of his precarious finances.<p>Chronology is equally challenging to the author. He lists an honorary degree from Maine's Bowdoin College as one of the praises heaped on Davis in 1861, when in fact Davis received the degree in 1858. The patent absurdity of a New England college giving a degree to the Confederate president should have occurred to someone connected with this book. <p>Equally troubling, sources are either misunderstood or misused. In several places where the narrative is clearly derived from one specific source, that source is not credited, and in others it appears that Bruce Chadwick simply borrows citations from secondary accounts. <p>Such shortcomings would be mitigated if his conclusions offered something new or trenchant. Nowhere, however, do we get the summary ""comparing the two presidents . . . to examine how the differences in their characters and styles of leadership affected the outcome of the war,"" which is Chadwick's avowed purpose in writing the book. Rather, there are just scattered comments during conventional biographical accounts of their administrations, and they mainly conform to traditional orthodox views.<p>The Civil War abounds in comparisons, this general versus that, this battle against another. It is one of the traditional means we have of measuring men and events to form conclusions as to why things have happened. No two men of their era offer a richer opportunity for comparison than Lincoln and Davis, and while contrasts between them have been made innumerable times, no one seems to have devoted a whole book to a comparison until now. Unfortunately, even after the appearance of <b>The Two American Presidents</b>, that job still remains to be done.<p><i>William C.

1670	038097794X		All Afire to Fight: The Untold Tale of the Civil War's Ninth Texas Cavalry	All Afire to Fight: The Untold Tale of the Civil War's Ninth Texas Cavalry	Crabb, Martha L.			"The regimental history, as a subgenre in American literature, has endured for well over 100 years. Eloquent writers and disciplined historians, rarely one and the same, have told the story of the men who have fought America's wars. There are a few superb unit histories and many more good ones, but the mass of regimentals remain unpoetic and merely informative. The ranks of the latter continue to grow.<p>The 9th Texas Cavalry did yeoman's service in the Civil War. From August 1861 to March 1865, the Texans skirmished, screened, patrolled, and raided with Confederate armies in the West and deep South. Fame has eluded the 9th Texas, just as it has the hundreds of other dependable yet unremarkable regiments that composed both armies, but Martha L. Crabb has tried to right that wrong. Her regimental history <b>All Afire to Fight</b> is as detailed and as loving as any one of those Texan troopers could have hoped for.<p>The author took her charge seriously and researched the 9th Texas to death. She compiled an impressive bibliography of primary sources and published histories. Then she interviewed combat veterans to get some idea about what battle was like. Next, she talked to cowboys and cattlemen to get a feel for horses. Crabb learned more than most of us want to know about the 9th Texas Cavalry and, unfortunately, decided to tell us everything. Page after page we read of the wet blankets, smoky campfires, numbing cold, dark nights, and muddy (or dusty) roads that made up the Civil War soldier's world.<p>Perhaps Crabb's goal was only to convey the hardship of a soldier's life (her best anecdote is that of two tentmates who were so impoverished in early 1863 that they had but one pair of pants between them. Whoever was on picket got to wear the pants, the other slept half-naked), but the minuti' build to stultifying levels. When, the tedium of camp and picket is given equal weight with the engagements and campaigns, the reader begins to question what is worth knowing and what is not. Like most books these days, this volume could have benefited from the attentions of a stern editor.<p>Crabb's prose has verve but is also overwrought. Her soldiers are not merely happy but ""pleased as a hungry trooper with a pig."" Of a foul day she writes: ""Rain, like the odor of a skunk, hung on and on,"" and a rainy night is ""dark as a wolf's mouth."" Neither her editor nor her publisher gave her enough aid in condensing the story or polishing the prose.<p>More disturbing, however, is Crabb's indifference toward historical method. She embraces the Texans, two of whom are her ancestors, and tells their story as they would have it told, placing no distance between herself and her subject, and viewing them sympathetically rather than objectively. Testimony of two Texans is cited to relate that in January 1864 black cavalrymen near the Yazoo River ""captured and later murdered"" two pickets of the 6th Texas Cavalry. This seems an important incident, and many readers, including this one, would like to know more about it. Racial tensions were high in that region at that time as Federals organized local ""contrabands"" into Union regiments, and such murders could have happened. But did they? Crabb apparently did not investigate the allegation. She willingly takes the Texans at their word, and when later they, according to their own account, routed a black unit and rode among the kneeling, pleading soldiers to deliberately ""blow their brains out and leave them to wilter in their own blood,"" Crabb has nothing to say except that only four of the 75 blacks survived and the Southerners had thus ""settled the score"" for the two dead pickets of a few weeks before. She adds, almost triumphantly, ""Not a Texan was scratched."" This is not good history.<p><b>All Afire to Fight</b> will be extraordinarily interesting to devotees of the 9th Texas Cavalry, but other readers might find the author's dedication to minuti' and her lack of objectivity discouraging. There is the potential here for an admirable regimental history; unfortunately there remains the need for the serious attentions of an editor.<p><i>William J.

1940	1572491302		Academy on the James: The Confederate Naval School	Academy on the James: The Confederate Naval School	Campbell, R. Thomas			"The resources of the Southern Confederacy were pitifully small at the outset of the Civil War, and they dwindled steadily as the struggle ran its course. This was especially the case with the South's naval efforts. Lacking a fleet or any hope of building one, Confederate accomplishments were singular, piecemeal, and occasionally quite successful.<p>Such escapades are not in this book. Rather, R. Thomas Campbell's fourth volume on Confederate ventures at sea treats a little-known aspect: the naval college established midway through the war. Modeled after the U.S. Naval Academy and designed to train young men for junior-grade ranks, the school did its best with what it had at hand. Its saga was brief and undramatic, heroic but of limited value.<p>Campbell has pulled together all the bits and pieces obtainable for this story of the naval school. Diary excerpts are included if they were found; huge chunks of Superintendent William H. Parker's printed and well-known memoirs are incorporated. When a midshipman wrote an account of any isolated action or observation on naval life, it too is included.<p>Although Campbell attempts to follow a chronological path, lack of source material often leaves the chapters as individual and unconnected theses.<p>The school opened in November 1863. The ""campus"" was the C.S.S. <i>Patrick Henry</i>, anchored at Drewry's Bluff in the James River below Richmond. Fifty-two midshipmen composed the student body. Superintendent Parker naturally receives much attention. The top graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy Class of 1847, Parker had the distinction of serving aboard both the U.S.S. <i>Merrimack</i> and the C.S.S. <i>Virginia</i> prior to taking charge of the young officers-to-be.<p>Following biographical sketches of other faculty members is a section devoted to the school-ship. Originally christened the <i>Yorktown</i>, the vessel was the <i>Patrick Henry</i> when she participated in the March 1862 naval battle of Hampton Roads. The side-wheeler remained in use as an academy until it burned in the evacuation of Richmond.<p>Confederate Secretary of the Navy Stephen Mallory receives deserved discussion. The innovative Floridian knew his fledgling navy would never be big enough to swap punches with the more established, greater-supplied U.S. Navy. So Mallory resorted to revolutionary weapons: ironclad ships, torpedoes (mines), tactical submarines, and the like.<p>There was a moment or two of drama for the midshipmen. In February 1864, eight of them were part of a raiding team that captured the U.S.S. <i>Underwriter</i> near New Bern, N.C. Three months later, 19 of the students joined the James River Squadron to contest Union General Benjamin F. Butler's army-navy advance up the river. Each naval group more or less bottled up the other. The midshipmen then returned to school until November, when all of the youngsters were ordered on active duty to assist hard-pressed Confederate forces. That was basically the end of the academy.<p>Campbell includes a number of appendices: a photo gallery of midshipmen, a roster of the academy, a list of midshipmen assigned while overseas, regulations for the naval school and of the <i>Patrick Henry</i>, plus other tidbits.<p>""The fact that the school existed at all is simply astounding,"" the author concludes. ""Even more remarkable is the success that the school enjoyed in spite of the terrible war that raged around it. School boys one day, soldiers the next, and yet through it all, the Academy was able to train and graduate these boys as junior naval officers who were second to none. In fact, they were no doubt superior to many, for their classroom instruction had been supplemented by active operational experiences.""<p>Campbell has sought earnestly to tell the academy's full story. Lack of sources blocked that objective. If the author occasionally relies too heavily on lengthy quotations from printed sources, it was the result of an honest effort to make the chronicle as complete as possible. No question exists but that the fragments woven together here are the fullest account of the Confederate Naval Academy this age will ever see.<p><i>James I.

1671	807824763		Iron Confederacies: Southern Railways, Klan Violence, and Reconstruction	Iron Confederacies: Southern Railways, Klan Violence, and Reconstruction	Nelson, Scott Reynolds			"The scholarship on the middle period of the 19th century in the South has prolifer-ated to such an extent over the past few decades, that it seems almost impossible to offer a new and fresh interpretation of events, whether they are political, social, economic, or racial. Scott Reynolds Nelson has done just that, however, in his study of railroad development in the southern Atlantic states -- what he calls the Confederate corridor -- stretching southward from northern Virginia to Georgia.<p>His view is novel because it integrates railroad building with, as he says, ""the increasingly disparate fields of labor, political, economic, cultural, and business history."" He shows who built the railroads, as well as how they were built, before, during, and after the Civil War, and how the ingenious A.B. Andrews and Moncure Robinson, from their base in North Carolina, created the Seaboard Inland Air Line during the early postwar period.<p>The Air Line was in fact not a railroad at all, but rather a transport company that relied on ""a logo, a stencil, a form, and a handshake."" It used waybills -- or a ""through bill of lading"" -- to transport cotton and other staple crops north to Norfolk. The major obstacle to Southern railroads in the prewar period was creating a north-south axis, with slave-owning planters usually supporting the traditional east-west movement of goods to familiar ports and merchants. The Air Line circumvented the political opposition by drawing on the efforts of the Confederacy during the War to transport goods north. ""Its status as a railroad company without railroad tracks -- as a public fiction -- made it elusive and effective,"" the author writes. By the early 1870s, however, Andrews was pushed out with the arrival of capital from the North.<p>While much of this is new, what is perhaps most exciting is how Nelson blends business and economic history with the impact of railroads on race relations. While many factors were involved, some of the most bitter and violent Ku Klux Klan activity in the Carolinas occurred in Alamance County, North Carolina, and Spartanburg, South Carolina, where railroad shops and connections upset racial norms and, in the minds of many whites, created too many opportunities for blacks to flaunt their newly acquired freedom. It was this as much as politics, the author suggests, that caused the eruptions of Klan violence.<p>One has to stretch the imagination to criticize <i>Iron Confederacies</i>, but it might have been revealing to view more closely the antebellum slave workers, the conscripted blacks during the War, and the postwar black convicts who largely built the lines. This is a minor matter, however, in an otherwise fine study, which offers new and fresh interpretations and does so by integrating a range of disciplines.<p><i>Loren Schweninger is professor of history and director of the Race and Slavery Petitions Project at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.</i>"	Schweninger, Loren	Winter 2000	1999-12-01	Review	Railroad development and race in the Confederate corridor	Only connect	University of North Carolina Press	0000-00-00				"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=244 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/ScottReynoldsNelsonIronConfederacies.jpg"">"

This volume follows an earlier one covering the years of the Texas Revolution and Republic through early statehood and secession.<p>""Like the first volume,"" general editor Patsy McDonald Spaw explains in the preface, ""the book is an informal reference work giving biographical information about members of the Senate, and describing issues of the day and Senate procedures used to address those issues. We have attempted to present the facts in an evenhanded manner and with minimal editorial comment, letting the facts speak for themselves.""<p>Reinforcing this editorial approach for the particularly bitter, violent, and racially divisive events of Reconstruction, Spaw continues, ""Both good and evil deeds were committed during the Reconstruction period, and we leave to the reader the interpretation of their participants' words and acts.""<p>With that purpose and style in mind, readers will probably not find this formidable tome as entertaining as it is informative. But in accomplishing their avowed mission, the authors do indeed provide a bountiful harvest gleaned from hundreds of scattered and often obscure primary sources, including Senate journals, committee reports, letters and private papers, and newspapers. <p>One is left to speculate, however, on the exact sources used at any given point in the narrative, since neither footnotes nor endnotes are provided. Especially useful, however, are the several appendices listing all members of the Senate (from the Ninth through the 21st legislatures) with the districts they represented and the home towns and counties in their districts.<p>Texas's role in the Confederate war effort is revealed by the Senate's increasingly urgent business in meeting pressing demands for Confederate military manpower, munitions, and other resources, and countering the economic strain and public trauma resulting from the Union blockade and the presence of enemy forces at several points along the coast. Many Texas senators served as military officers during the war, and their wartime activities receive full attention throughout.<p>Perhaps the most valuable aspect of this volume's biographical focus arises from the many unlikely and ironic twists in the careers of these men. For example, William H. Parsons, an ardent secessionist who achieved fame as the commander of Parsons's Texas Brigade in the war, became a Radical Republican during Reconstruction, joining with blacks to press for their full civil rights. <p>Arguing in support of the 15th Amendment to secure federally guaranteed voting rights for blacks, Parsons asserted: ""It is more honorable for us as a man, to now affiliate, as we do, with the party which conquered us, than again affiliate with the party that betrayed us."" That kind of revelation underscores the unstable and unpredictable essence of the lives and times described so thoroughly and accurately in <b>The Texas Senate, Volume II</b>.<p><i>T.

2119	553103148		1863: The Rebirth of a Nation	1863: The Rebirth of a Nation	Stevens, Joseph E.			"The summer of 1863 was a cruel season for the 4,500 starving, beleaguered citizens of Vicksburg, Mississippi. For the Confederacy, the town was the most strategic spot in the West. The fate of Vicksburg -- now surrounded by the 77,000 men commanded by Union general Ulysses S. Grant -- might just determine the fate of the Confederacy.<p>If the South lost the Mississippi River, it would forfeit the 150-mile-wide corridor south of Vicksburg to Louisiana's Port Hudson through which supplies and men poured east from western Louisiana, Texas, and Arkansas and sustained the Confederate armies. ""We may take all the northern ports of the Confederacy and they can still defy us from Vicksburg,"" Abraham Lincoln observed in early 1862. ""It means hog and hominy without limit, fresh troops from all the states of the far South, and a cotton country where they can raise the staple without interference. . . . That war can never be brought to a close until that key is in our pocket.""<p>Seizing Vicksburg would cut the Confederacy in two and re-open the Mississippi to Union boats. And thanks to Grant, Lincoln was about to pocket that key. After six weeks, Grant's army had virtually brought Vicksburg to its knees. The dejected and defeated city lay in ruins, the victim of a relentless artillery barrage that drove many terrified citizens to flee to caves they hastily carved out of the city's loess hills. In the early morning hours of July 4, the siege finally ended when Grant accepted the terms of surrender proffered by the Confederate commander.<p>Later that morning, a solemn General Robert E. Lee stood in the oppressive summer heat on the outskirts of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, watching his men load their wounded comrades onto ambulances. Battered and defeated, the Army of Northern Virginia was retreating after three days of the bloodiest conflict ever fought on American soil. Lee's audacious gambit to gain the upper hand by inflicting a decisive, fatal blow to Union forces on their own territory had failed miserably. With his crippled army now limping southward, Lee -- unaware of Vicksburg's fall in the early morning hours -- knew that the Confederacy had suffered a defeat of colossal proportions.<p>The gripping and compelling stories of these two decisive battles form the pivotal center of Joseph E. Stevens's <b>1863: The Rebirth of a Nation</b>, a month-by-month account of the political and military events of a most momentous year.<p>Every so often, there is a 12-month period around which the future of a nation turns. For the United States, those include 1776, 1787, 1812, 1942, 1954, and 1968. In 1863, Stevens conclusively adds the third year of the Civil War to that list.<p>Few years were as important to the political and cultural history of the United States. When it began, Union forces were still reeling from their devastating defeat at Fredericksburg. The Confederates were ascendant and a despondent Lincoln desperately prodded his recalcitrant generals to engage the Confederates in battle. By year's end, the tide of war had turned -- this time for good. The Confederate armies were now shells of their former selves.<p>It was a year that began with Lincoln's signing of the Emancipation Proclamation and closed with the Confederacy's humiliating defeat at Chattanooga. In between were some of the most important battles of the war -- Gettysburg, Chancellorsville, Vicksburg, Chickamauga, and Chattanooga. Perhaps nothing, however, served to elevate the year more than Lincoln himself, when he delivered his Gettysburg Address and interpreted the greatest and most decisive battle of the war for all of history.<p>A remarkable year like 1863 deserves a historian to make sense of the vast political, military and cultural tides sweeping over the United States, transforming and shaping it forever. In 1863, Stevens more than rises to the occasion. His narrative is magnificently and eloquently written, the result of impressive research and a keen eye for the detail that brings an old story back to life.<p>Stevens paints vivid portraits of the year's major characters -- Lincoln, Grant, Lee, and Confederate President Jefferson Davis -- while allowing us to see the war through the eyes of politicians, nurses, businessmen, artists, and newspaper editors, as well as common citizens whose lives were destroyed or transformed by the conflict.<p><b>1863</b> will no doubt be remembered as one of the more compelling accounts of a most important and pivotal year in American history. <p><i>Robert Mann is author of </i>The Walls of Jericho: Lyndon Johnson, Hubert Humphrey, Richard Russell and the Struggle for Civil Rights.<i> He is currently writing a political history of the Vietnam War.</i>"	Mann, Robert	Summer 1999	1999-06-01	Review	The events of one year decided the nation's future	The fiery trail	Bantam	0000-00-00				"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=243 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/Stevens1863Rebirth.jpg"">"					
2041	865546274		Lincoln and His Contemporaries	Lincoln and His Contemporaries	Hubbard, Charles			"The superb essays in <b>Lincoln and His Contemporaries</b> were developed from the Centennial Lincoln Symposium at Lincoln Memorial University in April 1997. Edited by Charles Hubbard, executive director of that institution's Abraham Lincoln Museum, the book apprises both Civil War scholar and buff alike of current interpretations in Lincoln scholarship regarding three crucial areas of importance: his embattled reputation as commander-in-chief, his aims and accomplishments regarding African American rights, and the role of enemy agents in destroying the President of the United States.<p>The first section contains three essays devoted to Lincoln's relationship with his generals. According to essayist Judge Frank Williams, in ""Abraham Lincoln, Commander-in-Chief or Attorney-in-Chief,"" many of Lincoln's skills, his intuitiveness, and extraordinary common sense developed during his years as a practicing attorney. Although the problems he solved as a lawyer were different from those he solved as president, Williams holds that the incisive logic used in their solution was much the same. He points out how Lincoln's ability to compromise and negotiate settlements for his clients contributed greatly to Lincoln's later ability to gain the support and goodwill of his military and political contemporaries. These skills enabled Lincoln to lead the nation in time of war and thus redefined the American political and military system. Judge Williams brings his own legal experience to bear on his assessment of Lincoln's presidential ability.<p>Using contemporary printed images, contributor Harold Holzer identifies and traces three distinctly different public images of Lincoln. First, he suggests that during the first two years of his presidency, Lincoln was perceived as weak and possibly even cowardly. Secondly, however, there was a distinct shift toward respectability in depicting Lincoln after the Battle of Antietam and the Emancipation Proclamation. And finally, after his assassination, contemporary artists deified and defined the president as much more than an ordinary hero. Holzer develops well the relationship of art and its effect on public opinion.<p>John Y. Simon's essay on ""Lincoln and Halleck"" is an outstanding explication of Lincoln's remarkable ability to deal with a wide range of personalities, especially that of General Halleck. Simon suggests that Halleck's incompetency became a buffer that deflected criticism of the overall military strategy, which might otherwise have been directed at the commander-in-chief. Simon makes an ironic case that this incompetent general served Lincoln very well. As chief military advisor to the president, Halleck failed miserably. But Lincoln used Halleck's disastrous career to broaden his own political base and to maintain public support for the Northern war effort.<p>The second section contains two essays that describe Lincoln's aims and accomplishments regarding the rights of African Americans, who as much as any identifiable group were affected dramatically by the president's wartime policies.<p>Hans Trefousse in ""Lincoln and Race Relations"" holds that Lincoln believed in and reflected liberal attitudes toward race relations. Trefousse argues that Lincoln's liberalism would have minimized the divisions in post-Civil War America; the president always considered African Americans to be human beings and not members of a separate species, whether equal to the whites or not. Later, President Johnson's racism contradicted Lincoln's ideas.<p>The disappointments and frustrations felt by African Americans during the Lincoln administration are ably developed in Edna Greene Medford's essay ""Something More Than the Mere 'Union' to Fight For."" Medford agrees that the black response to Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation acknowledged the president's step toward fulfilling the expectations of African Americans. But it did not address Lincoln's failure, as blacks viewed his policies, to address their demands for equality under the law. Black abolitionists never forgot his slowness in advancing emancipation and his support of colonization.<p>The final section presents three essays that address the current debate regarding Lincoln's assassination and enemy agents and their conspiracies. Terry Alford focuses on profiling Lincoln's assassin. He portrays John Wilkes Booth as a committed reactionary -- a fanatic, but not a fatalist -- who sought to create political and military disruption that Booth sincerely hoped would permit pro-slavery elements to retain control of the Confederate government and maintain its army in the field. Alford holds that ""it is not possible to understand the murder outside the war that produced it,"" caused as it was by ""the juncture of Booth's unique personality and the Confederate collapse in 1865.""<p>William Hanchett's contribution ""Shooting the President as a Military Necessity"" holds that the murder of Lincoln involved more than Booth's ""unique personality,"" that in fact he conspired with the Confederate leaders. It has long been believed, as Alford's essay contends for Lincoln's murder, that Booth developed his plan on his own initiative. Hanchett boldly declares that ""recent scholarship has established beyond any reasonable doubt that Confederate leaders in Richmond and Canada formulated the plan [to capture Lincoln] and recruited Booth to carry it out,"" but that by March 1865 it was too late to capture Lincoln because Union cavalry blocked access to Richmond and there was no place to take a captured president. Hanchett asks: ""Why should not southern leaders now have concluded that the doctrine of military necessity...justified direct attacks on him and members of his administration?"" In Booth's own words: ""Something decisive and great"" must be done. So he murdered Lincoln.<p>Thomas R. Turner's concluding essay, ""The Creation of an American Myth: The Assassination of Abraham Lincoln,"" reveals the controversy which surrounds Hanchett's position regarding the Confederate plot and Booth. Turner states that there is no direct evidence to support a larger conspiracy theory or to link Booth to it; he holds that only circumstantial evidence supports Hanchett's claim of a larger conspiracy. However, Hanchett points to Turner's words in his 1982 work, <i>Beware the People Weeping</i>, that after removing all the perjured testimony at the Trial of the Conspirators in 1865, ""there was still a volume of apparently untainted testimony that led to the...conclusion of southern involvement and foreknowledge of the plot."" But in his essay Turner declares that ""in cases such as this, the historian should demand more than circumstantial evidence.""  And so we have come full circle in viewing the conspiracy to capture or destroy the 16th president of the United States.<p><i>Ronald D.

1639	395916828		Picturing Lincoln: Famous Photographs That Popularized the President		Sullivan, George			There have been several books about the Lincoln image designed for younger readers. <b>Picturing Lincoln</b> is the most recent, and also the best. <p> The author, George Sullivan, focuses on five photographs (of the more than 100 for which Lincoln sat), and demonstrates how they helped not only to popularize, but to define Abraham Lincoln during his lifetime and after his death. In presenting lively descriptions of the circumstances of each sitting, he manages as well to offer a brief biographical sketch of Lincoln's adult years, from his days as a congressman through his presidency and the Civil War. Sullivan's is a neat accomplishment. <p> The book begins with Alexander Hesler's famous tousled-haired photograph for which Lincoln posed in 1857, goes on to present the enormously influential Cooper Union photograph taken by Mathew Brady in 1860, and concludes with the three immortal camera studies that Alexander Gardner made in Washington in 1864: the penny profile, the so-called five-dollar-bill image, and the picture of Lincoln reading a book to his son Tad. <p> All are seminal Lincoln images, Sullivan asserts, because they were popular in their own time and in their original formats, and also because they inspired engravers, lithographers, sheet music publishers, cartoonists, campaign button-manufacturers, and even sculptors, to copy and adapt the pictures into different media. The results became display pieces in the homes of Lincoln admirers throughout the country, and vivified his evolving image as Honest Abe, the Great Emancipator, and the nation's martyr. <p> These themes have been amply covered before (my co-authors Mark E. Neely, Jr. and Gabor Boritt, for example, wrote <i>The Lincoln Image</i> [Scribner's] 17 years ago). But Sullivan's book is made impressive by the fine selection of illustrations, the crisp writing, and the thoughtful picture captions that nicely demonstrate the ways in which clever artists copied, retouched, improved, and disguised period photographs. <p> Sullivan's cogent, never patronizing style is aimed at younger audiences, but wisely assumes that in this age of widespread access to computer graphics, his readers are familiar with the techniques of massaging visual imagery. <p> The book would have been even more impressive had the author relied on (and more routinely cited) scholarly sources, and less often recycled dubious tales from popular histories like James D. Horan's 45-year-old biography of Mathew Brady (<i>Mathew Brady: Historian with a Camera</i>, Crown, 1955), which perpetuate unsubstantiated anecdotes about Lincoln's experiences before the cameras. And future editions of the book might take care to correct the illustration of A.B. Walter's famous Lincoln family engraving on page 58 (it appears flopped) and to revise the credit to the Lincoln Museum of Fort Wayne's Cindy VanHorn, who is incorrectly listed in the acknowledgment as an employee of Ford's Theatre. <p> But these are quibbles. <b>Picturing Lincoln</b> offers a fine introduction to Lincoln iconography, and its author and publisher deserve much praise for the result. This book is highly recommended for young readers. <p> <i>Harold Holzer has co-authored six of his 18 books on Lincoln and Civil War art, printmaking, and photography.

2251	820320331		Rich Man's War: Class, Caste, and Confederate Defeat in the Lower Chattahoochee Valley	Rich Man's War: Class, Caste, and Confederate Defeat in the Lower Chattahoochee Valley	Williams, David			"There is no mistaking the theme of this passionate book: the Confederacy lost the Civil War because of the arrogance  and avarice of the planter class. The planters started a conflict that they alone wanted, contends David Williams, and they did nothing during the course of the rebellion to win the loyalty of the South's black or poor white populations. <p>To make his case, Williams explores the course of the war in 13 Georgia and eight Alabama counties that sat, cheek by jowl, along the southern border of those two states. ""Perhaps nowhere can the decisive role of the economic class system and the caste system of slavery be viewed more clearly,"" he asserts in explaining his choice of location, ""than in the lower Chattahoochee River Valley of Georgia and Alabama."" It is not an entirely new proposition. <p>A region awash in class conflict<p>Other historians have stressed class divisions in the Confederacy, but none has done so more fervently or relentlessly than Williams. He draws a portrait of a region awash in class conflict and caste divisions. <p>By ""caste"" Williams generally means racial divisions, but he also believes that the ""South's socioeconomic hierarchy was so rigid that even the white social structure might be more accurately defined as a caste system in which yeomen and poor whites had little chance for upward mobility.""<p>Few Southern yeoman, poor whites, or other ""plain folk,"" a group that, for Williams, also includes small merchants and skilled artisans, thought they had anything to gain from a war. As increasing numbers of white plain folk and slaves turned against the rebel cause, Williams says, the Confederacy faced certain doom. <p>The grumbling of soldiers while on campaign, the discontent of their families at home, the defiance of Confederate deserters, and the expectations of slaves all convey the mood and emotions of an escalating cycle of rebellion. Conscription, high taxes, starvation, homelessness, and every form of physical suffering destroyed whatever vestige of loyalty plain folk may have felt for the government, especially when they saw planters protecting themselves from these hardships through hoarding, speculation, and draft evasion. Williams carefully and convincingly shapes every variety of unhappiness to buttress his interpretation of a disenchanted region seething with resentment against the slaveocracy.<p>There is some truth in all this. As far back as Ella Lonn and Albert B. Moore, writing in the 1920s, historians have pointed to fissures of discontent and alienation within the Confederacy. A consistent parade of scholars, including Frank L. Owsley, E. Merton Coulter, Bell I. Wiley, David H. Donald, and Richard E. Beringer, et al., in <i>Why the South Lost</i> (1986), have suggested that the Confederacy may have collapsed as much from lack of unity on the home front as from battlefield defeats. Still, Williams has gone a step beyond all of them, even advocates of the class conflict thesis, in stressing the definitive impact of the rebellious plain folk. Unhappily, his argument is weakened by a number of unresolved questions and contradictions.<p>Most obviously, Williams overgeneralizes to a precarious degree. Rather than sticking to events on the lower Chattahoochee and restricting his conclusions to that region, he makes sweeping statements about the entire South -- even the North, on occasion -- that he cannot justify. Thus the battle between union and secession, he says, hinged on class conflict not only along the Chattahoochee, not only across the entire South, but in the North, too. ""The side that could most successfully, within its own socioeconomic confines, suppress or redirect class antagonism would emerge the victor,"" Williams asserts. ""It was the most important challenge faced by either camp.""<p>Williams creates a similar problem when he combines examples of class conflict from other parts of the South with his analysis of the Chattahoochee. Even when dealing with Georgia and Alabama, he occasionally strays to towns and counties that were very different in geography, economic interests, and social composition from his region. The impression thus created, whether accurate or not, is that he must rely on evidence from other areas in order to make a substantial case for his own counties.<p>The next most vulnerable spot in Williams's argument concerns the prevalence of class conflict. Having insisted that class divisions were the most important factor in Confederate defeat, it is incumbent upon him to provide absolute connections between the two. Yet Williams too often assumes that anyone who complained about the Confederacy must necessarily have done so for reasons of class. This is evident when he discusses desertion and draft resistance. <p>Many men deserted, as Williams demonstrates, because of heart-wrenching appeals from scared and hungry families. But desertion, even when inspired by such entreaties, cannot automatically be taken as a sign of class resentment, and desertion did not necessarily mean disloyalty to the Confederacy. Williams also attributes draft resistance, especially after passage of the twenty-slave law, to class conflict, even though he acknowledges the deep political resentments conscription caused and quotes opponents of the draft who spoke in terms of ""the people of Georgia"" and ""every body,"" not just poor people.<p>Confusing class conflict with Unionism<p>Confusing class conflict with Unionism does not help matters. In describing the anti-war activities of a local peace society, Williams asserts that ""active membership clearly numbered in the thousands, and thousands more were sympathetic to the peace movement."" Yet this peace society kept no records and held no regular meetings, which, besides leaving the numbers in doubt, makes it difficult to attribute conscious class motives to its members. <p>Similarly, Williams attributes the Confederate election results of 1863, which saw many pro-secession legislators replaced by anti-war and Unionist candidates, to ""class-based political consciousness."" He supports this contention, in part, by pointing to the success of the Mechanics' and Working Men's ticket in the city elections of Columbus, Georgia. Yet Columbus had the ""largest concentration of Unionists"" in the valley, and half of the city's skilled workers -- who, one assumes, would have formed the core of the Mechanics' ticket -- had been born outside the South. Consequently, class may have had something to do with political opinions in Columbus, but other factors were clearly at work too.<p>Chattahoochee is overshadowed<p>In tying racial caste to Confederate defeat, Williams sides with those historians who believe that slaves played an active role in liberating themselves, a not unreasonable assertion within certain constraints. Williams relies heavily, as do most historians who discuss this elusive subject, on the WPA slave narratives, and he feels confident enough in his findings to assert that ""the black caste's collective antagonism contributed as much as that of whites to Confederate defeat."" <p>Yet this conclusion, even more than his emphasis on class antagonism, seems strained. Large parts of his argument -- those dealing with runaway slaves, insubordination toward masters, and the role of blacks in the Union army -- have little if anything to do with events in the lower Chattahoochee. <p>All this is not meant to disparage the obvious diligence of his research or the clarity of his writing, only to warn readers that in his enthusiasm to draw meaningful -- not to say controversial -- conclusions Williams sometimes claims too much. He uses a sledgehammer where finesse is required, and the consequences too frequently batter the more praiseworthy aspects of his work.<p><i>Daniel E.

1449	395659949		Ulysses S. Grant: Triumph Over Adversity, 1822-1865		Simpson, Brooks D.			"These are good times for Ulysses S. Grant, whose reputation took a beating a generation ago at the hands of William S. McFeely. My own, admittedly admiring, biography was published in 1997, the first volume of Brooks D. Simpson's book has finally appeared, and yet another Grant bio-graphy, by Jean Smith, is expected next year.<p><b>Ulysses S. Grant: Triumph Over Adversity</b> was many years in the making, years during which Brooks Simpson established a reputation as an authority on Grant. The jacket copy proclaims that this is the ""definitive"" account of Grant's life. <p>The author, however, has produced a biography that reads much like earlier interpretations, beginning with Grant's own account of his life as a soldier. Grant chose to present himself as a man who, lacking any interest in a military career, was forced into it. Then, for no evident reason, he rose to the top thanks to a combination of good luck and a cool, dispassionate recognition that the Civil War had its own rules and its own demands. <p>Professor Simpson relates the stories others have told many times -- the unwilling and unhappy West Point cadet, the young lieutenant tested in the Mexican War, the abrupt resignation from the Army in 1852. He recapitulates the well-known stories about Grant being forced to resign on account of drunkenness, without adducing any new evidence to support them.<p>The heart of this book is, of course, the Civil War. Simpson's description of Grant's successes and failures does not provide the reader with anything much in the way of new sources or fresh interpretations. Simpson is content, too, to follow Grant in a strictly chronological fashion from start to finish.  <p>The greatest challenge any biographer faces is to reach the inner life of his subject. Sad to say, however, there is no serious attempt at psychological insight in this book. If anything, Simpson's rare comments on the inner life of Grant are diffident and tentative, invariably flagged with a ""perhaps"" or some similar equivocation. Simpson chooses instead not to stray far from his standard primary sources -- Grant's memoirs and <i>The Papers of Ulysses S. Grant</i> (Southern Illinois University Press), the source for about 40 percent of the footnotes in Simpson's book -- and various secondary sources that have stood the test of time, notably the works of Lloyd Lewis and Bruce Catton. The result is a close reading of the documents rather than a close reading of the man.<p>For example, there is no serious discussion of Grant's love of poetry; his powerful pictorial imagination (as evidenced by his remarkable, even though untutored, artistic ability); his striking gift for clear, logical thought, a gift both revealed and strengthened by his talent for the higher branches of mathematics. <p>Similarly, his acute sensitivity to landscape goes unremarked, and, as far as Grant's complicated feelings about war are concerned, Simpson is content to take Grant's assertions of repugnance and horror at face value. His wife, Julia, however, knew better. She had been with him on campaign and aptly observed that Grant ""could no more resist the opportunity to fire a gun than a woman can resist bonnets.""<p>The repugnance was undoubtedly genuine and ran deep, but the drama of war was simply irresistible to Grant, who was restless, easily bored, always craving distraction of some kind. That mercurial spirit helped propel him to the top of the army and to the top of American politics. Unfortunately, there is little sense of that spirit at work in Professor Simpson's book, even though great historical figures are never types but are always exceptions. The reader who hopes to find insights here into the nature of Grant's exceptionalism may well feel disappointed.<p>Simpson appears to have made a conscious decision to take Grant's memoirs as his model. In some ways, there could hardly be a better choice, but the standard it sets is a daunting one. Certainly Simpson's narrative flows clearly for most of the time. In a serious military history or biography that is far more difficult to achieve than most readers realize. It must be said, though, that his publisher has let him down in places. There is no map for the Mexican War, an inexcusable omission given the complexity of that campaign and the unfamiliarity that most readers have with the geography of northern and central Mexico.<p>It must be noted also that Simpson lacks Grant's inner ear, that poetic sense that tells a writer when the language is working for him, and when it's not. As a result, he lapses unwittingly into the demotic of our day and the results are inept and distracting: Grant ""kept his cool,"" ""Grant deadpanned,"" John Rawlins had problems with ""personal demons."" <p>More troubling is the misuse of basic military terms and concepts. Simpson appears to believe that any number of infantrymen, engaged in any kind of operation, can be described as ""a column."" This was not so in the age of linear tactics. He remarks, too, that Grant ""had yet to command a force in combat"" when he received his commission as a colonel. In Mexico, however, although Grant had no formal command over an infantry unit, he did what good infantry officers are expected to do -- exercise command when and where it was needed. His feats in this regard earned three brevet recommendations. <p>Similarly, Simpson remarks that in Mexico, ""Grant's efforts to gain reassignment to a combat unit failed."" This again shows an unfamiliarity with the army, because there can be no doubt that Grant was assigned to a combat unit, the 4th Infantry Regiment. <p>It is striking, as well, that when slaves such as Dred Scott and William Jones appear, briefly, in these pages, they are referred to as ""Dred"" and ""William"" following their initial appearance. Yet after first establishing the full name of, say, Lorenzo Thomas or Leonidas Polk, who also make brief appearances, they are subsequently referred to as ""Thomas"" and ""Polk,"" not ""Lorenzo"" and ""Leonidas."" It would be wrong to read a lot into this kind of insensitivity, but it has no place in modern scholarship.    <p>In the end, what Brooks D. Simpson has produced in the first volume of his biography of Grant is a work offering little that will be new to those already familiar with the Civil War, its battles, and its personalities. Nevertheless, it provides a competent, workmanlike introduction to the subject for the large number of people who come fresh to it every year. Its few errors of fact and other lapses should be easy to correct in subsequent editions.<p><i>Geoffrey Perret is the author of 10 books, mainly in the fields of military history and biography.

1784	1582180679		The Battle of Gettysburg	Battle of Gettysburg The	Paris, Comte de			"These chapters from the Comte de Paris's multi-volume <i>History of the Civil War in America</i>, originally published as a one-volume work in 1886, collected here as <b>The Battle of Gettysburg</b>, provide a readable, generally clear treatment of the battle, with some surprising insights, such as the count's defense of General Longstreet in the dispute over the organization of ""Pickett's Charge.""<p>Modern readers, however, may find the work's style rather cumbersome (""During this time, Vincent, hastening the pace of his soldiers, has reached the base of this same hill""). Moreover, in keeping with 19th century optimism and romantic militarism, everyone is uniformly brave and gallant, while there is a definite lack of attention to technological matters; for example, the author never once mentions that Buford's division's stubborn resistance to Heth's division on the morning of the first day was largely due to its ability to generate much greater firepower. On the positive side, the work presents one of the clearest word-pictures of the physical environment of the battle, no mean feat.<p>As a reproduction of the original work, complete with maps, this edition of <b>The Battle of Gettysburg</b> is quite well done. However, any reissue of a work more than a century old should merit a contemporary introduction discussing its relationship to modern scholarship.<p>The CD-ROM version of this edition is identical to the print version. CD-ROM technology offers important benefits to the researcher. It is possible to search for key words or phrases. This is particularly valuable when a book is either poorly indexed, or not indexed at all, as is the case for many older works. In addition, the reader can excerpt portions of the text with ease without having to resort to manual transcription, a boon for anyone wishing to quote a paragraph or two for use in a paper.<p>Digital Scanning has undertaken an ambitious program of reproducing, both in print and in CD-ROM format, a number of 19th century works, primarily Civil War-related. Yet a glance at its catalogue does not reveal many titles in desperate need of reissue. <b>The Battle of Gettysburg</b>, for example, was reprinted as recently as 1988. Other titles include <i>McClellan's Own Story</i> and <i>Personal Memoirs of U.S. Grant</i>, neither of which is particularly rare. In fact, aside from William Schoulter's <i>History of Massachusetts in the Civil War</i>, none of the Civil War titles is facing extinction. The publisher would do well to follow up Schoulter's work with some other selections from the enormous pool of valuable works that have been long out of print, such as <i>The Register of the Volunteer Army of the United States</i> and many of the state official histories, both Northern and Southern, such as Frederick Phisterer's <i>New York in the War of the Rebellion</i>.<p><i>Albert A.

2098	1565546865		The Confederate Cookbook: Family Favorites from the Sons of Confederate Veterans		Moreau, Lynda			"This is a terrific cookbook, and some very nice history as well. <p> The recipes in <b>The Confederate Cookbook</b> are not ""authentic"" in the sense of being from verified Civil War-era or earlier cookbooks, nor do they claim to be. They originate in the family lore of Sons of Confederate Veterans (SCV) members and their spouses from all over the place. Did you know there are SCV groups in Brazil? <p> Alongside each entry are the names of the SCV contributor and the Confederate soldier from whom the member is descended. The majority of recipes are from the  offspring of humble privates and corporals, although descendents of a general or two - J.E.B. Stuart IV contributed a recipe for spoon bread - can be found in the pages. <p> Some historical entries just name the ancestor and the unit in which he served. Others are more comprehensive, and their stories are especially delightful. In what other book would you find it recorded that Captain Stephen Ashley Cawthon of the 6th Florida Infantry carried a walking stick that one could peer into to see a miniature of James Walker's painting ""Battle Above the Clouds?"" He amused children with it until 1918. <p> The truth of the matter is that many of these recipes could have been produced in the 1860s. CrFme brvlTe has not changed in content since that time, although it is a lot easier to prepare with a modern broiler than with an old-time ""salamander"" device. The three recipes for red beans and rice are from different sources with differing ingredients, and all are no doubt equally as good. Similar variations on basic dishes can be found in period cookbooks, some based on geographical differences, and others simply on individual taste.  <p> Other recipes are quite thoroughly and unquestionably modern. We are prepared to state unequivocally that no soldier, Confederate or Union, ever sat down to ""Hot and Spicy Tofu Stir Fry"" or ""Seven-Up Pound Cake""! Some recipes are matters of regional preference, as is illustrated by the recipe for ""Persimmon Cookies."" While persimmons are regarded an ordinary fruit in some areas, old-timers in west Kentucky regard them as too disgusting to feed to pigs.  <p> Those who cook, those who eat, and those who like history will enjoy this book. It would make an excellent item for holiday giving.  <p> <i>Laurie A. Chambliss is the cookbook editor of </i>Civil War Interactive (www.civilwarinteractive.com)."	Chambliss, Laurie A.

1640	195115589		The Civil War: A History in Documents		Seidman, Rachel Filene			"This is history as it should be read: history as told by the people who lived it. Not a listing of facts and figures. Not the words of distant observers-academic scholars, romantic revisionists, or popular storytellers. This history is not difficult, sentimental, or incomplete. <p> In <b>The Civil War: A History in Documents</b>, the past is totally in focus-relevant and overpowering. We cannot help but be affected. Rachel Filene Seidman, who teaches history at Carleton College and writes on northern women during the Civil War, introduces us to all kinds of people and encourages us to get to know them personally. And in presenting and discussing their diaries, letters, documents, prints, and photographs, she asks readers to interpret the wants, beliefs, prejudices, fears, and pain embedded therein. <p>  Seidman advises, ""Primary sources cannot be viewed simply as containing the truth. We need to ask questions about sources as we read them. What message is the author trying to get across? Who was the intended audience? How does that affect the way the author wrote?"" Needless to say, history not only springs alive, but <i>readers</i> also come alive and take a creative role in it. Seidman reminds us as historians to try to have a clear mind and to be sensitive to our own biases. <p> The book's purpose is to acquaint us with an in-depth look at the Civil War, which is far from an easy task. Seidman's selections sweep from the war's early rumblings to its long and disappointing aftermath. But the text does not follow the daily path of the battles, because military history is actually only a small part of the story. For Seidman, the ""core of the conflict"" is slavery. It is what split America in two and affected not just the soldiers, officers, and people in government-the voices we tend to know-but women, blacks, Native Americans, and observers off the battlefield. All these people struggled with the meanings of the war, government, and country-and, perhaps most of all, humanity. <p> While carefully selected photographs and prints are interspersed throughout the book, one chapter is entirely devoted to the images of war. Here, Seidman addresses how artists handled the limitations of the media as well as the incredible power of their creations. An extensive reading list, time line, text credits, and index are also included. <p> This work is part of a series intended for students at the high school level and above that includes volumes on the New World, the Depression and New Deal, imperialism, the Gilded Age, and the Cold War, with more to come. Don't be dissuaded by the dry title or textbook look; <b>The Civil War: A History in Documents</b> will cause you to pause, consider, and question this ""wrenching, triumphant, and tragically flawed event."" <p> <i>Carolyn P.

1891	807825522		The Richmond Campaign of 1862: The Peninsula & the Seven Days		Gallagher, Gary W.			"This is the seventh installment in the University of North Carolina Press's Military Campaigns of the Civil War series. Though each volume is intended as a supplement to more traditional narratives, the series has been influential in providing new interpretations by challenging tired assumptions and supplanting old questions. <p> A common thread that ties the series together are the essays by Gary W. Gallagher, which place each campaign in a broad context. In fact, the opening essay in <b>The Richmond Campaign of 1862</b> by Gallagher is best read alongside his essay in the companion volume, <i>The Antietam Campaign</i>. Reading the two essays in conjunction reveals how each campaign flowed into the other. <p> Not only in the case of the Richmond campaign, but also with any military operation, we need to know, according to Gallagher: ""How did it figure in the entire tapestry of the war? How did Union and Confederate civilian morale change as a result of the campaign? How did the Army of the Potomac and the Army of Northern Virginia change? Was the conflict significantly different because of what happened on the Peninsula and at Richmond during that spring and early summer?"" <p> Such questions have challenged critics of Lee's military strategy who argue that his reliance on offensive tactics drained resources and deprived the Confederacy of victory. These critics - most notably, Alan Nolan - rely primarily on the analysis of statistics and questionable assumptions about what kind of decisions would have led to lasting Confederate independence. <p> Though there may be a certain amount of pleasure in speculating about whether Lee's offensive tactics (compared to the alternative of a defensive stance) cost his nation the war, it is not clear that we learn anything about Lee's thoughts and the historical context in which he operated. Gallagher and other contributors in the series continually remind us that decisions on the battlefield and even its location are rarely decided in a vacuum; there are constant economic, social, and political pressures. <p> Two additional essays in <b>The Richmond Campaign of 1862</b> take on the challenge of placing the Richmond campaign in a broader perspective. The first, by James Marten, addresses the ways in which the location of the Union army on the Peninsula affected the lives of white and black noncombatants and how that presence affected the socio-political structure of southeastern Virginia. In another essay, William A. Blair sets the battles in the context of how they influenced and convinced Northerners that ""little hope existed for a significant loyalist groundswell within the Confederacy."" Through key committees in Congress and the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War, radical leaders were able to push for changes in the military policies concerning the confiscation of property, the return of fugitive slaves, and the eventual use of blacks in the army. Though Blair does not directly address the issue, his argument has important bearing on the subject of whether the South succumbed as a result of battlefield losses or an insufficient level of nationalism. <p> Other essays focus on narrower topics, including the performances of Stonewall Jackson, John Magruder, and George McClellan. William J. Miller assesses McClellan's tactical decisions from the perspective of his chief engineer, General John Gross Barnard, who was responsible for constructing bridges over the Chickahominy River. Robert E.L. Krick examines the charge of W.H.C. Whiting's division at Gaines's Mill and concludes that it was a ""defining moment in the history of the Army of Northern Virginia."" The final essay by Keith S. Bohannon looks at artillery effectiveness at Malvern Hill. With the publication of this book, The Military Campaigns of the Civil War series now extends through to the battle of Spotsylvania in 1864, making it easier for readers to take what I call the ""long-view"" of the Civil War. <p> <i>Kevin Levin (<A HREF=""mailto:kvnlvn@ cs.com"">kvnlvn@ cs.com</a>) teaches United States and world history at St. Anne's - Belfield School in Charlottesville, Virginia.

1774	080782481X		The Antietam Campaign: Military Campaigns of the Civil War	Antietam Campaign: Military Campaigns of the Civil War The	Gallagher, Gary W.			"This is the sixth in editor Gary Gallagher's series <i>Military Campaigns of the Civil War</i>, and once again he has overseen an eclectic mix of essays that explore the topic from various angles. Some among  these ten essays bore in closely on that terrible Antietam battlefield on September 17, 1862. Others scan the campaign from a loftier perspective to analyze intentions, results, and implications.<p>Gallagher starts off the proceedings by pointing out that historical hindsight has invested Antietam with a turning-point-of-the-war status, yet at the time Southerners concluded that their army had done pretty well in Maryland. It captured 12,000 Yankees and vast munitions at Harper's Ferry, fought the Federals to a standstill at Sharpsburg, and then leisurely returned to Virginia after repelling an attempt at pursuit at Shepherdstown. The Maryland expedition did not seem to signal an end to Confederate hopes.<p>McClellan's lieutenants supported caution<p>In a parallel situation, historians may condemn McClellan for not renewing the battle on September 18, yet Brooks D. Simpson finds evidence that McClellan's lieutenants largely supported their cautious commander in seeing off the enemy without a fight. Nothing better demonstrates Little Mac's grip on his lieutenants than their parroting of his chimerical insistence that Lee had the larger army and they best leave him alone that fateful September 18.<p>Confederates were disappointed that Marylanders did not rise up to join the secession movement the moment Lee's army appeared in their midst. William A. Blair notes that the Lincoln administration's iron-fisted hold on this border state convinced many in Confederate states of the rightness of their course in seceding from such Yankee tyranny.<p>Two essays examine a major handicap each army carried with it into Maryland. Keith S. Bohannon forcefully demonstrates the shambles Confederate logistics had become by September 1862 and thus one reason why Lee had so few men with him at Sharpsburg. Numbers present was not McClellan's problem, but D. Scott Hartwig points up how utterly ill-trained and ill-led were the rookie regiments that made up almost a quarter of his force. By way of example, Lesley J. Gordon follows the raw 16th Connecticut to its disastrous appointment on the Antietam battlefield. The poor 16th never had the chance to renew its tarnished reputation.<p>For battle buffs, the Kricks, father and son, give us incisive microhistories of two key phases of the Antietam struggle. Robert K. Krick explains in engrossing detail the Confederates' bloody fight in Bloody Lane. Robert E.L. Krick performs a similar feat with the Confederate artillery under Jeb Stuart that masterfully defended Nicodemus Heights and Hauser's Ridge. The Confederate near disaster at Shepherdstown, orchestrated by artillery chief William Nelson Pendleton, is elucidated by Peter S. CharMichl, who goes on to explain how the inept Pendleton managed to hold his place until Appomattox.<p>Finally, Carol Reardon describes how officers training at the U.S. Army War College pondered the lessons of Antietam after staff rides there on the eve of World War I. It was generally agreed that Lee was an example of how to, and McClellan an example of how not to. ""My God,"" observed Captain Matthew F. Steele in 1908, ""what a poor general McClellan was."" Gary Gallagher's informative volume has many lessons for us, and that is certainly one of them.<p><i>Stephen W. Sears is author of </i>Landscape Turned Red: The Battle of Antietam, George B.

1892	1580970338		The Fredericksburg Campaign: November - December 1862		Brooks, Victor			"Through most of the Civil War's campaigns in the Virginia Theater, Fredericksburg held a position near center stage. The opposing capital cities of Washington and Richmond lay equidistant on either side; wagon roads converged in town; a major river flowed past; and a railroad crossed the river in downtown Fredericksburg. From May 1862 to May 1864, the contending armies regularly occupied the valley of the Rappahannock River. <p> Through four days in December 1862, Federals and Confederates waged desperate war -  first in the streets of town, then in its outlying house yards and adjacent fields. Perhaps because the battle unfolded so simply, and attacking Northerners were slaughtered with such relative ease, Fredericksburg remains after 138 years the only major Civil War battle in Virginia that never has been the subject of a thorough, scholarly monograph. Victor Brooks's <b>Fredericksburg Campaign</b> does nothing whatsoever to fill even a modest corner of that void. <p> The book is part of a series called Great Campaigns, which does not pretend to break new ground, so it of course cannot be damned for something it does not strive to achieve. The 210 pages of heavily illustrated text include an array of sidebars (several dozen routine words about General E.V. Sumner, for example). Some of the slender budget of prose describes preliminaries and postscripts to the main event. No notes accompany the text. In place of a bibliography the publisher supplies a three-page ""Guide for the Interested Reader,"" which enumerates two dozen books (including novels) and a television series. The ""Guide"" does not so much as mention the two most serious books about Fredericksburg, those by G.F.R. Henderson (<i>The Campaign for Fredericksburg</i>, 1886) and Vorin Whan (<i>Fiasco at Fredericksburg</i>, 1961). <p> If readers will accept the goal of a <i>Reader's Digest</i> approach to a major battle, the author does a decent job of summarizing a familiar story. The prose is workmanlike, unveiling the tale of Federal disaster without any attempt at new information. The superficial rehash inevitably produces casual errors. The ""snowy fields"" of page 217 actually were bare, under an Indian summer day of nearly 60 degrees of warmth. The night after the battle provided ample misery for everyone, but the frozen corpses in a frozen landscape described on pages 190-91 do not fit with the actual low temperature of forty degrees. <p> The maps also introduce distressing mistakes. To name a few: Massaponax Creek is misrepresented on page 104; <i>Stafford</i> and <i>Humphreys</i> and <i>Featherston</i> are misspelled on page 146; and the crucial gap in the Confederate line above Hamilton's Crossing is shown as three times too wide on page 126. <p> <b>The Fredericksburg Campaign</b> offers no new information, no new sources, no new insights. It joins several previously published overviews of the great battle. Students wanting something more will have the chance soon to buy major monographs from two authors, George Rable and Frank O'Reilly, who have used manuscripts exhaustively and will produce truly important work on Fredericksburg, from somewhat different perspectives. <p> <i>Robert K. Krick, the author of a dozen Civil War books, has lived on the battlefields around Fredericksburg for 30 years.</i>"	Krick, Robert K.

"To reconstruct the past, through discipline and discrimination, is satisfying to the historian, and possibly useful to those who read him. To make explicit its lessons, somehow to make them useful and instructive, and possibly influential, is more difficult, and perhaps more dangerous.<p>Harry Crocker's book is subtitled <i>Executive Lessons in Character, Courage, and Vision.</i> Early on, it states its purpose as ""a book for businessmen -- the vocation that most Americans are called to perform -- seeking guidance on how to lead a business, employees, subordinates. But it is also a book for the whole man."" In other words, <b>Lee on Leadership</b> aims to identify what it was in this ""most perfect man"" that made him successful as a leader. Can we learn and apply such lessons?<p>Matthew Arnold called Marcus Aurelius the most perfect man in history. In our own time, among men of affairs, we say that George Marshall was a perfect embodiment of devoted public service. But all such men, near-demigods to some, succeed less by what they do than by what they are; and history is embarrassed when it tries to communicate that ""are"" -- their character.<p>Nonetheless, Crocker identifies a number of qualities in Lee that would seem useful to all who would lead. His method is chronological: a series of chapters that follow Lee from adolescence to early old age, that cross familiar ground, but in new ways, and in ways that remind us that nobility of character, self-discipline, and forbearance, unaccompanied by a practiced ability to get things done, is not very useful in war.<p>Each chapter ends with the lessons enumerated, such as ""A leader remembers that the goal of leadership is not self-fulfillment but service to his fellow men.""<p>And the leader, if he emulates Lee (emulation plays but a small role in any scheme of education in the America of 1999), will lose himself in the work, will be ""careless"" of self and nobly humble, eschewing self-advertising.<p>This strange, hybrid book -- part historical, part biographical, and part handbook -- is beautiful in its concision and austerity. The author wears his philosophy and his knowledge of Lee, and of the theaters in which Lee worked, easily.<p>The tone is elegiac, as if Crocker understands, as most of us do, that it is impossible that such a man should appear again -- and that the qualities and techniques of leadership that infused his character can but serve as reminders and guides to the frailer clay that now presumes to lead -- to lead <i>anything</i> -- in our country.<p><i>Josiah Bunting III serves as superintendent and professor of the humanities at Virginia Military Institute.</i>"	Bunting III, Josiah	Fall 1999	1999-09-01	Review	What General Robert E.

Through study of the activities of two large geographical and population groups-upper South whites and middle South slaves-he demonstrates the importance of those people's actions to the ultimate Union victory. In order to strengthen his theory, Freehling also discusses the basis for the upper South's neutrality, Lincoln's tortured racialist path to the Emancipation Proclamation, and the arguments both North and South used for and against arming the slaves. <p> The first section of this splendid volume is devoted to what Freehling calls ""white on white."" For him, the neutrality of the border slave states made the Confederate war effort vulnerable to internal dissent. The loss of nearly half of the slave states' whites to neutrality and then support for the Union army's invasion diminished the geography and population that the Confederacy could tap for its defense. Unionism in slave border states on the eve of secession, Freehling claims, resulted from a steadily declining upper South slave population, which thereby freed the white people to move toward the mainstream of free labor life. The upper South, in turn, contributed to divisions within the middle South, especially in eastern Tennessee and western North Carolina. Together, the loss of the white troops that potentially could have been raised in such areas greatly lessened the Confederacy's ability to defend itself. <p> But, the central focus of this volume-the section on slave laborers, or ""black versus white""-is Freehling's major contribution to what doomed the Confederacy. Building on the research of Ira Berlin and others, Freehling maintains that Union use of contraband runaways slaves as garrison keepers, home guards, military laborers, and cooks added crucial numbers to strengthen the occupying forces of the northern army. Some newly made ex-slaves, along with northern blacks, also became soldiers in the Union army and helped to penetrate ever deeper into the middle and lower South. Freehling lastly describes the importance of black soldiers to Grant's siege below Petersburg, and how Sherman used and abused black people as he thrust into the Confederacy's heart. <p> To this discussion of black troops and helpers, Freehling adds the theory that the Confederate ability to fight was further undermined by the labor implications of a slaveholding society fighting a modern war. A too-successful slave labor economy had not only kept a cotton-sated England neutral, but more damagingly discouraged the South from diversifying its economy to build a modern military-industrial infrastructure. In addition, the industrial jobs that brought whites to the North meant that the South always fought undermanned. And, at the last, Freehling points out that, when a dreadfully understaffed southern army might have turned to black fighters for help, the South's own racism and inconsistent views of what black people could do made that venture impossible. <p> Freehling has thus written a rejoinder to those who doubt the centrality of slavery to the southern cause and to its conduct of the war. Perhaps even a stronger case could have been developed had Freehling studied other southern anti-Confederates, such as the southern loyalist or Tory leaders who also helped to undermine the Confederacy while remaining ambivalent about the future of slavery. But in this fine book, Freehling has made a major contribution to Civil War studies, giving the reader an evenhanded look at the physical and mental blight of southern slave culture, which precipitated a northern war of attrition against all of the southern people. He also has made a forceful case about the moral blindness of northern racism that undermined the peace process. Alas, proof of this assertion is ever present in our land. <p> <i>Jon L.

1844	1578600707		Coburn's Brigade: 85th Indiana, 33rd Indiana, 19th Michigan, and 22nd Wisconsin in the Western Civil War		Welcher, Frank J.	Ligget, Larry G.		Traditionally, regiments have most often been identified with the shared experiences of the common soldier in the Civil War. However, as is recognized by anyone who examines the War in detail, it was at the brigade level that the overwhelming majority of citizen-soldiers participated in the conflict. <b>Coburn's Brigade</b> reinforces the reality that the three million volunteers and regulars assembled in Union and Confederate field armies camped, marched, and fought in brigades - the optimal tactical organization of the Civil War.  <p> Aware of the importance of the brigade experience, Frank Welcher and Larry Liggett have co-authored a painstakingly detailed unit history of the northern brigade commanded by Colonel John Coburn. It is the story of a brigade that has gained a reputation both notorious and laudatory in Civil War history.  <p> During the Civil War, the assignments of regiments to any particular brigade were usually not permanent. For three years, from 1862 to 1865, the Federal brigade commanded by John Coburn proved to be one of the exceptions. In October 1862, at the height of hurried recruiting activities when it appeared Confederate forces campaigning in Kentucky would cross the Ohio and invade the Upper Midwest, the 85th Indiana, the 33rd Indiana, the 19th Michigan, and the 22nd Wisconsin regiments were assembled into a brigade under Coburn's command. Within six months of their organization, the men of Coburn's brigade experienced the disgrace of surrender and public/political accusations of misconduct (unfairly so, the authors argue) when captured by Earl Van Dorn's Confederate cavalry at Thompson's Station, Tennessee, on March 5, 1863.  <p> In the aftermath of this controversial incident, the men of Coburn's brigade struggled to endure a brief incarceration as prisoners of war at Libby Prison in Richmond. After parole and exchange, they reunited in Middle Tennessee, determined to redeem the brigade's honor. Instead, their services were exhausted in numerous menial labor details, constructing fortifications and building bridges, supplying labor details for the quartermaster's department, guarding railroad facilities, and other mundane duties so frequently associated with army routine in the Western Theater.  <p> Then in the spring of 1864, having regained the confidence of their superiors, Coburn's men fought with distinction in the Atlanta campaign and became the first Federal force to enter Atlanta upon its fall. Later, under the command of Colonel Daniel Dustin, the brigade experienced hard and significant campaigning in the Georgia Lowcountry and in the Carolinas, as it participated in the principal events associated with Sherman's March. The four regiments assigned to the brigade managed to stay together until their military service was discontinued in June 1865. <p> In preparing this study, Welcher and Liggett have tackled the difficult problem of writing about an unusual subject - relating the war service of a military organization that was not always newsworthy and glorious. The authors detail the story of how these citizen soldiers faced the stigmatized experience of collective failure and non-combat assignments, and analyze the process by which four Midwestern regiments were ultimately welded together into a cohesive fighting group.  <p> Throughout the narrative, the day-to-day activities of the brigade are brought to life in exhausting detail, and some readers may find it a daunting read. For example, well over 200 pages are used to relate the movements, activities, and combat of the brigade during the momentous campaigns in Georgia and the Carolinas. It is most fortunate, then, that the authors researched a host of  primary sources - reports, letters, diaries, newspapers, and postwar publications by brigade members. The labor of this research has been generously used to illustrate and enrich the overall narrative. The humanity of common men bonded by the shared challenge and ordeal of military service clearly emerges from the historical writings referenced throughout the book. These forceful first-person impressions relate the often mundane, sometimes harrowing collective experience of men confronted by bitter civil war.  <p> <b>Coburn's Brigade</b> provides the reader with a different understanding of Civil War unit solidarity. It is a story of unit cohesion built on the shared desire to win redemption. <p> <i>Stacy D.

3622			REDISCOVERING CIVIL WAR CLASSICS		Madden, David			Trail-Makers of the Middle Border<br>Hamlin Garland<br>The MacMillan Company<br>ISBN 1417906480<br>$79.00<br>426 pp. hardcover<p>An East Tennessean, I came to my earliest study of the Civil War poorly armed with a picture of Yankees and Rebels from the states east of the Mississippi warring against each other. And even now, I am often surprised all over again to be reminded of the fact that thousands of Americans marched away from their fields in such faraway northern trans-Mississippi states as Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Iowa, and from the Dakota Territory, and fell in fields way down South in Dixie. </p><p>At least in the abstract, few wars are as well remembered as the American Civil War, especially in the South; and even Northerners tend to picture that War as a Southern experience. </p><p>The Southern Mountain folks and the Plantation Lowlanders have always been an exotic people in the eyes of industrial Northeasterners and agrarian Midwesterners, just as in the eyes of most Americans the four years of Civil War battles, especially in the South, are a romantic though brutal era. Enlistment offered a delightful excursion into a strange and beautiful country, a land of flowers and romance. The long list of the dead after Shiloh so affected civilians and soldiers that, as Hamlin Garland observed in his seminal work <b>Trail-Makers of the Middle Border</b>, [a]ll levity remaining in the minds of those who had hitherto regarded the war as a romantic excursion vanished utterly.</p><p>Compared with the battle years, the long twilight of the antebellum era and the prolonged darkness of the Reconstruction eraรนalmost three times longer than the war yearsรนare faint echoes in the consciousnesses of most Americans. But Civil War battles were suddenly pitched and suddenly over, and in the end, the battles ceased. To dwell upon battles and related activities is attractive and easy. To get into focus the eras before and after and to listen imaginatively and compassionately to the muted voices of Americans, especially northern Midwesterners, during those eras is very difficult.</p><p>I am convinced that we understand ourselves as Americans more profoundly when we take on the task of focusing upon the kind of life Americans led before and after the War than when we repeatedly wander the battlefields in books and on foot.</p><p>Hamlin Garland's lifelong mission was to give Americans a full picture of the life of ordinary men and women of the northern Midwest, before, during, and after the war. He achieved that mission so well in his autobiography, <i>A Son of the Middle Border </i>(1917), that he became the famous national literary figure he always dreamed of being; the sequel, <i>A Daughter of the Middle Border</i>, won the Pulitzer Prize for 1922. </p><p>He wrote no book primarily about the Civil War battle-era but wove it into the tapestry of frontier life that he began to weave with his first successful book, <i>Main-Traveled Roads: Six Mississippi Valley Stories</i> (1891), the most powerful of which is, The Return of a Private. A major scene in Garland's autobiography, <i>A Son of the Middle-Border</i>, is the same homecoming of a private. I had heard about Hamlin Garland much of my life but had not read his work until stumbling onto <b>Trail-Makers of the Middle Border</b> in a Louisiana antique store near Port Hudson. My hunch that it would deal somehow with the Civil War proved true when I looked at Part II, In War, 180 pages of a 426 page book, Part I of which is called In Peace. This book, too, ends with the homecoming scene. </p><p>In The Return of a Private, soldiers returned with a dumb expectancy. The returning father of this autobiographical story saw himself sick, worn out, taking up the work on his half-cleared farm, the inevitable mortgage standing ready with open jaw to swallow half his earnings. He had given three years of his life for a mere pittance of pay, and now---. Peace-time life ain't exactly like dying, he says, as Garland interjects, An observer might have said, He is looking down upon his own grave.' Going home, [h]e crawled along like some minute wingless variety of fly, haunted by images of battlefield slaughter:  The boy lay with his face in the dirt in the ploughed field they were marching across. The welcome home is awkward, but his son (Garland) will never forget that figure, that face. It will always remain as something epic, that return of the private. </p><p>The private indulges in the privacy of his own bedroom. They were lovers again . . . . Then they rose . . . . They began to plan fields and crops for next year.  Here was the epic figure who Walt Whitman has in mind, whom he calls the common American soldier      . . . . With livery of war on his limbs, this man was facing his future, his thoughts holding no scent of battle. Clean, clear-headed . . . he turned future-ward with a sublime courage. Even so, he entered upon a still more hazardous future . . . . The common soldier of the American volunteer army had returned. His war with the South was over, and his fight, his daily running fight with nature and against the injustice of his fellow men, was begun again. But in Garland's eyes, [h]e rises into a magnificent type. Garland might well have included Southern agrarian veterans when he concludes, [t]hey are fighting a hopeless battle, and must fight till God gives them furlough. Garland's style is riddled with war words, expressing his swing in attitude back and forth from epic optimism about the future to foreboding. While his victorious Union was punishing the South with almost two decades of Reconstruction, the private was still fighting to survive on the frontier. For a vivid image of the veteran farmer, see Winslow Homer's painting <i>The Veteran in a New Field</i>; the veteran seems to mimic the sickle of war, of death. Or perhaps defy it once again.</p><p>When we compare The Return of a Private with the opening of <i>A Son of the Middle-Border</i>, we see that the mature writer of fiction refers to himself only as the child; then the child as an adult tells the true story of the father but from the perspective of the child. In <b>Trail-Makers of the Middle Border</b>, the successful writer tells the fictional story of his father's wartime struggles in peace and in battle simultaneously with the story of his friend Ulysses S. Grant. (Almost three decades earlier, Garland published <i>Life of Ulysses S. Grant</i> (1898)). The father had left Boston for a new life on the frontier but saw only a pitiful ending of high hopes and of seven years of unremitting and savage toil. He did not go to war for Wisconsin. He was going to aid in the preservation of a national ideal  . . . . Lincoln was his leader and Grant his warrior. Both were Western in spirit. He and his neighbors saw a man a little above middle height and of powerful build, the soldier's attitude expressed a quiet dignity, and they had faith that Captain Grant will put the shouting into something concrete. When Vicksburg surrendered after Grant's ruthless siege, the General did not boast. Plain as a farmer in dress and manner, no knight of Arthur's court was more essentially the courteous foe . . . . This entire campaign had the audacity of the trail . . . . In the three works (fiction and autobiography) that I cited previously, Garland's father is extolled as an ordinary man and so is Grant, with the difference that the father is thrust into extraordinary events led by an apparently ordinary man who evolves into an extraordinary leader. In <b>Trail-Makers of the Middle Border</b>, Garland artfully develops the character of the private and his general in alternate passages. </p><p>Hamlin Garland was born in a log cabin near West Salem, Wisconsin. His father migrated there from Maine. He moved the family to Iowa when Hamlin was nine, and they toiled twelve years on a Middle Border farm. In 1881, the father moved further north and westward to Ordway, South Dakota. Hamlin had a violent affection for his mother and resented the hard life his father imposed upon her. </p><p>Garland's autobiographical writings told the story several times over of his own movement from frontier childhood to youthful rebellion. Relentlessly pushing westward like his father, he was, ironically, pulled backward to the east. Eventually, the reluctant young frontiersman sought another life in Boston. The lingering painful irony of Hamlin's life and his literature was that his pioneer father left his mother to go to a war that pitted brother against brother, and Hamlin left his mother on the frontier to go to the literary wars of the Northeast, where he wrote about both abandonments. Hamlin dramatizes the bitter fact that men fighting battles always implies women fighting battles of their own. He never got over feeling guilty for leaving or neglecting his mother. Escaping season-driven poverty and monotony on a Wisconsin frontier farm, he embraced captivity in the Boston library, educating himself and aspiring through excruciating poverty to cultivate an intellectual development rivaling what Harvard offered. Whitman changed the world for me, the world being America. The spiritual significance of America was let loose on me.  And Henry George enabled him to see the cause of poverty and suffering in the world. I like to imagine Garland quoting Grant to express his intentions toward the Boston literary elite: I propose to move immediately upon your works.</p><p>Garland's informal lectures somehow caught the attention of William Dean Howells, editor of <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>, who became his longtime mentor. Hamlin's first published work was a play, <i>Under the Wheel: A Modern Play in Six Scenes </i>(1890).  <i>A Spoil of Office</i> (1892) was his first novel. <i>Rose of Dutcher's Cooly</i> (1895) was proscribed in many libraries for its treatment of sex. <i>The Captain of the Gray Horse Troop</i> (1902) was a conventional romance set in the West. </p><p>Garland had good reason to call himself a literary nomad. From Boston, he moved westward again to Chicago, where he conformed, married, prospered and became domesticated. New York lured him eastward again; then in 1930, Los Angeles lured him the final western frontier for the last decade of his life. </p><p>Garland was thirty-one years old when his first important book, <i>Main-Traveled Roads, Six Mississippi Valley Stories </i>(1891) appeared; when he died in 1940 in Hollywood, he had published many works of fiction and nonfiction and was a beloved national icon. </p><p>In his lucid introduction to the 1963 Civil War Centennial Holt edition of <i>Main-Traveled Roads</i>, Thomas A. Bledsoe offers some key phrases, his own and that of others, so vivid I will quote and paraphrase them as I string out my own commentary.</p><p>What put Garland on the map as a literary critic was <i>Crumbling Idols: Twelve Essays on Art, Dealing Chiefly with Literature, Painting and the Drama </i>(1894).  An offended reviewer opined that the book should have had for a cover design a dynamite bomb. He had a fearsome positiveness, an absolute certainty of belief in all his views, no matter how recently won, no matter how soon to be lost. He was a realistic critic of the rigors of prairie existence. But he was no naturalist, no determinist. He never wrote without a sense of individual responsibility. Indignant, but nostalgic, he was always optimistic, as contrasted to the pessimism of naturalist Stephen Crane. </p><p><i>Jason Edwards:  An Average Man</i> (1891), a short novel, is about the failure of the average man to achieve the American Dream in a nation that had plunged itself into nightmare when Garland was an infant. His dedication expresses his vision: To the Farmers' Alliance, Whose high mission is to unite the farmer and the artisan, the north and the south, the blue and the gray under one banner, marching in a continent-wide battle-line against the denial of equal rights, I dedicate this story, with its implied hatred of all special privileges. That vision still motivated him when he wrote <i>The Book of the American Indian</i> (1923), expressing his indignation over the plight of the American Indian . . . . Very nearly equal to his best, especially the story Outlaw.</p><p>In <i>A Son of the Middle-Border</i>, Garland stated his credo: Obscurely forming in my mind were two great literary conceptsรนthat truth was a higher quality than beauty, and that to spread the reign of justice should everywhere be the design of the artist. Bledsoe says Garland wrote in a mood of bitter resentment, with full intention of telling the truth about western farm life. He quotes Garland's assertion that he tried to keep a certain balance between Significance and Beauty and to let the artist check the preacher. Henry James saw the beauty of art in his work. The Private's Return,' says Bledsoe, remains an artistically effective story.</p><p>Bledsoe stresses the contrast between the bitter realism of <i>Main-Traveled Roads</i> and the complacent romanticizing of <i>They of the High Trails</i> (1916), its later counterpart,รนthe polemical rebellion of a radical intellectual regional writer and the sentimentality and quaintness of a mere local colorist. From start to finish, however, he was a moralist in various modes. The man and the reputation comprised those and other paradoxes.</p><p>Garland emerged from his self-education regimen in the Boston Public Library a lonely figure with the highest aspirations and within a decade had become a public figure, notorious realist and radical. Within another decade, he had moved from the rhetoric of outrage to pathetic clichฮs, from moral indignation to banal bromides, somewhat as the wartime action of a soldier may surrender to the peacetime bombast of a veteran. In his old age he inveighed against the preponderance of degrading literature in America. No fireside is safe from the reek of the roadhouse.</p><p>Beloved as a typically American writer in his prime, Garland was not well-regarded by H. L. Mencken, who called him a stranger on Parnassus. Wallace Stegner declared that among Iowa's cultural regionalists, Garland is of the first importance. Carl Van Doren saw Garland as having been misled by the false light of local color, but regarded <i>A Son of the Middle Border</i> as his best. Bledsoe contradicts Van Doren with his own choice: <b>Main-Traveled Roads</b>, one of the genuinely significant American autobiographies, and an essential book for anyone who wishes to understand the time. Bledsoe concludes that Garland's was not a major talent, but that he wrote two minor masterpieces. </p><p>Having tried to suggest here that parts of Hamlin Garland's work deserve a declared place in Civil War literature, I fervently hope that a university press will reprint <b>Trail-Makers of the Middle Border</b>'s Part II, In War, along with passages from his Grant biography, the short story The Return of a Private, and other passages from among his works.<p>________________<p><i>Founding Director of the Civil War Center and creator of </i>Civil War Book Review<i>, David Madden is author or editor of six books on the Civil War, the most recent of which is </i>Touching the Web of Southern Novelists <i>(University of Tennessee Press, ISBN 1572334630, $37.00, hardcover).

4122			EDITORIAL: Commemorating the Life of Lincoln		Childers, Christopher			"Two hundred years ago this month, our nation's sixteenth president was born in a one-room log cabin in Hardin County, Kentucky.  As so many Americans learned in grade school and have read in numerous books, Lincoln rose from those humble beginnings to become president of a nation in the midst of its greatest crisis.  He succeeded in saving the Union and died for that cause.  So goes the simplified (and somewhat romanticized) version of the Lincoln story.  Yet the story itself has become ingrained in American culture.  In so many ways, the life of Abraham Lincoln personifies all that we believe about the Ameircan dream, the promise of the common man rising to greatness, and even the very type of person we want to be.  The story of Lincoln's life--and plenty of the Lincoln myth--resound in the minds of a wide range of people, from the careful student of Civil War and 19th century history to the casual reader.</p>
<p>
In this yearโs editions of <i>Civil War Book Review</i>, we commemorate the life of Abraham Lincoln.  Each issue will contain special features on the life of Lincoln and on the latest scholarship on the 16th president.  Of course, in this bicentennial year of his birth, scholars have renewed their already prodigious interest in Abraham Lincoln, his life, his presidency, and his significance in American history.  Some seek to correct old myths, others seek to retell the amazing story of Abraham Lincoln's life.  But all seek to understand a man who most everyone would agree was one of our nation's greatest leaders--if not the greatest.  <i>CWBR</i> will fully cover the burst in Lincoln scholarship as this bicentennial year unfolds. </p>
<p>
In this issue, readers will find several important features on the latest in Lincoln studies.  The <i>CWBR</i> Author Interview features renowned Lincoln scholar Harold Holzer discussing his new book <i>Lincoln President-Elect: Abraham Lincoln and the Great Secession Winter, 1860-1861</i>.  Several historians have reassessed Lincolnโs ascent to power and how he handled the crisis of the Union prior to his inauguration.  And as Holzer discusses in his interview, he believes that Lincoln faced the challenges not as an inexperienced political novitiate, but as a savvy politician.  In addition to his political career, students of the Civil War era remain fascinated by Lincolnโs personal life.  Daniel Mark Epstein has written a book about the marriage of Abraham and Mary Lincoln, a hotly debated subject since the death of Abraham Lincoln in 1865.  Virginia Laas reviews <i>The Lincolns: Portrait of a Marriage</i>.  In his latest installment of <i>Rediscovering Civil War Classics</i>, David Madden discusses a new releaseโFred Kaplanโs <i>Lincoln: The Biography of a Writer</i>โa book that rediscovers the literary side of the 16th president.  Madden critiques Kaplanโs analysis while suggesting other ways to view Lincoln as a writer.  And in <i>Civil War Treasures</i>, Leah Wood Jewett combs the archives of the Louisiana State University Librariesโ Special Collections division for primary and secondary source material related to Abraham Lincoln.  Her latest column serves as a ready reference guide to Lincoln and the archival collections of our host institution. </p>
<p>
In addition to our special focus on Lincoln in this issue, we also include plenty of new titles on the Civil War era in general.  Georgia receives special attention in this issue, as we feature reviews of two books on the city of Savannah, reviving interest in the study of the warโs impact on southern cities.  Jacqueline Jones has written <i>Saving Savannah: The City and the Civil War</i>, which Mary A. DeCredico reviews.  And Mark A. Smith reviews <i>Guardian of Savannah: Fort McAllister, Georgia, in the Civil War and Beyond</i>.  Shermanโs March to the Sea continues to fascinate scholars; perhaps no military engagement had such a deep psychological impact on southerners as this engagement.  Noah Andre Trudeauโs <i>Southern Storm: Shermanโs March to the Sea</i> offers a narrative history of Shermanโs campaign.  Brian Melton reviews this new release.  And in <i>Shermanโs March in Myth and Memory</i>, Edward Caudill and Paul Ashdown discuss how different groups of Americans have remembered the march since the end of the war itself.  Glenn Robins reviews this book.</p>

Finally, 2009 marks the tenth anniversary of <i>CWBR</i>.   We are fortunate to have such a loyal base of readersโ2.5 million last year aloneโwho support our work by frequenting the web site, sharing with friends, and contributing to the financial support of the journal.

1538	553096338		Grant		Byrd, Max			"Ulysses S. Grant, the soldier who won the Civil War and saved the Union, remains an enigma, a wildly popular national figure who was both a monumental success as a soldier and a dismal failure as a civilian. Much has been written about Grant the soldier, but now author Max Byrd cleverly explores the last five years of Grant's life in his new novel, <b>Grant</b>. <p> Byrd is the award-winning author of five detective novels, but he is perhaps best known for his exceptional historical novels, <i>Jefferson</i> (1993) and <i>Jackson</i> (1998). With <b>Grant</b>, Byrd uses the familiar <i>Jackson</i> formula, having journalists tell the story as they question, probe, pry, and dance around the periphery of the great general as he slides from prosperity to poverty in the years 1880 to 1885. <p> Following two disastrous terms as the 18th president of the United States (1868-1876), Grant's enduring popularity almost propels him back into the White House in 1880 for an unprecedented third term. Sylvanus B. Cadwallader, a wily newspaperman for the <i>Chicago Times</i> and the <i>New York Herald</i>, and Nicholas Trist, a cynical Civil War veteran writing for a French magazine, cover the political story of Grant, but each man has a different perspective of the general who ""don't scare worth a damn."" <p> Cadwallader, a pro-Grant biographer, has seen both sides of the general. He accompanied Grant on numerous campaigns during the Civil War as a correspondent, and now dogs the general as just another hack looking for a scoop. His admiration for Grant, however, puts him at odds with the reporter's creed - never let the facts get in the way of a good story. Trist, who lost an arm at Cold Harbor in one of Grant's worst and most unforgivable battles, has good reason to be bitter, although his view of Grant will take a surprising turn. <p> Through Cadwallader and Trist, Byrd tells of the presidential scandals that disgraced Grant's administration, the political expediency and duplicity of the lost third-term nomination, the shocking bankruptcy of Grant's Wall Street fortune, and Grant's agonizing death in 1885 from virulent throat cancer. <p> Although Grant is the subject, Cadwallader and Trist are the colorful features that move through the complex political, financial, and social circles of Washington, D.C., Chicago, and New York. Personal affairs interfere with their professional lives, and they become involved with liars and thieves, drunks and charlatans, friends and enemies of Grant, and the ever-present corruption and hypocrisy which marked that era of American life. <p> This is a vibrant, stunning story of Grant's last years, but, best of all, it is a gripping tale of ""the reborn nation, on the other side of the war."" This is a most suitable companion to the year's other outstanding novel about U.S. Grant, Richard Parry's <i> That Fateful Lightning</i>. Byrd's next historical novel will be about Mary Todd Lincoln. <p> <i>William D. Bushnell is a freelance writer, book reviewer, and instructor at the University of Southern Maine.

1821	679455175	$27.50	Not War But Murder: Cold Harbor, 1864		Furgurson, Ernest B.			"Ulysses S. Grant's offensive against Robert E. Lee's entrenched Army of Northern Virginia at Cold Harbor on June 3, 1864, summons powerful images. Northern assaults that day stand alongside Ambrose E. Burnside's attacks at Fredericksburg and John Bell Hood's at Franklin as examples of seemingly pointless slaughter of brave but doomed soldiers. Even casual students of the conflict know that Grant admitted as much in his memoirs when he confessed that he ""always regretted that the last assault at Cold Harbor was ever made."" <p> Despite the well-known drama and gruesome butcher's bill on June 3, historians have devoted relatively little attention to Cold Harbor. It served as the last major battle of the Overland campaign, greatly influenced morale behind the lines in the North, and set the stage for Grant's brilliant crossing of the James River - all attributes that invite scrutiny. But historians have focused on the opening rather than the closing battles of the Overland campaign, writing several detailed studies of the Wilderness and Spotsylvania. Perhaps the apparent simplicity of the action at Cold Harbor on June 3, with unimaginative and costly frontal attacks that ended in predictable failure, has discouraged potential investigators. <p> Ernest B. Furgurson's <b>Not War But Murder</b> offers the first full-scale treatment of the subject. Furgurson brings to his task skills that produced successful earlier books on the Chancellorsville campaign and Richmond's wartime experience - careful research in an array of published sources and unpublished manuscripts, an engaging and sometimes eloquent writing style, awareness of the many ties between the battlefield and the home front, and a deft touch with brief biographical sketches. <p>  The book emphasizes that the celebrated fighting on June 3 represented just one element of a much larger set of maneuvers and clashes near Cold Harbor between May 28 and June 11 that produced more than 15,000 Union and between 3,000 and 5,000 Confederate casualties. A pair of chapters set the stage with an overview of events from the Battle of the Wilderness on May 5-6 through action along the North Anna River three weeks later. Subsequent chapters highlight the cavalry engagements at Haw's Shop on May 28 and at Matadequin Creek on May 30, the armies' jockeying for position and skirmishing along Totopotomoy Creek on May 28-31, fighting at Bethesda Church on May 30, and aggressive Confederate movements and Union responses at Cold Harbor on June 1-2. Furgurson allocates less than 10 percent of his narrative to the combat on June 3, moving on to a consideration of the battle's aftermath, its impact on northern politics and Union and Confederate civilian morale, and the reshuffling of units that preceded Grant's march to the James River. <p> Furgurson introduces a good deal of analysis into his chronological narrative. Much of it centers on Grant, George G. Meade, and the Union high command. He argues that Grant's decision to accompany the Army of the Potomac while leaving Meade as its titular head fueled tensions and prevented efficient application of superior northern manpower and resources. ""Grant did not know the Army of the Potomac intimately enough to give detailed orders as if he were the only general in charge,"" observes Furgurson, while ""Meade did not feel deep personal responsibility for managing operations that Grant had broadly planned."" <p> Dangerous misconceptions about both the Rebel army and his own force contributed to Grant's decision to launch the attacks on June 3. He believed the Confederates suffered from low morale after being hammered at the Wilderness and Spotsylvania but thought Union soldiers retained high spirits despite heavy casualties in attacks against entrenchments during the first three weeks of May. On June 3, he hoped his men would win a decisive success against a weakened foe. But ""Grant badly misunderstood the enemy, from Robert E. Lee down to the leanest Alabama rifleman,"" argues Furgurson. ""He also misunderstood his own army, from George G. Meade down to the weariest Massachusetts private. That helps explain why the assault failed so miserably."" <p> <b>Grant refused to concede</b> <p> Furgurson further criticizes Grant for failing to admit defeat after June 3. The Federal commander allowed wounded Federals to lie helpless between the lines rather than raise the white flag in order to have them removed. Sending a formal request to Lee under a white flag of truce, Furgurson notes, for Grant would have ""meant conceding what every soldier in both armies could see but had not yet been absorbed in Washington and beyond: that he had been decisively beaten in the climactic battle of the bloody spring offensive, his first campaign as general-in-chief."" Although indicating that Lee bore part of the blame for unnecessary delay in getting relief to the wounded Federals, Furgurson judges Grant much more harshly. <p> Grant insisted that Cold Harbor gave Confederates only a momentary lift and had no long-term negative effect on Union soldiers. Furgurson notes persuasively that nearly the reverse was true. The bungled Union attacks against Petersburg in mid-June underscored the pernicious influence of a ""Cold Harbor syndrome"" that rendered northern troops less effective than in previous battles. Cold Harbor also sent tremors through the North, contributing to a period of growing doubt about the outcome of the War. As for Grant, he admitted failure in his effort to defeat Lee's army north of Richmond but blamed that failure ""not on his own strategy, but on the Confederates' unwillingness to abandon their trenches and fight on his terms."" <p> Although generally well-written and soundly argued, Furgurson's narrative sometimes claims too much or relies on questionable evidence. For example, Furgurson asserts that Cold Harbor marked a tactical ""turning point of the Civil War,"" after which ""the war of maneuver became a war of siege; stand-up attack and defense gave way to digging and trench warfare."" Yet as the opening section of <b>Not War But Murder</b> makes clear, digging and trench warfare had become standard features of the confrontation between Grant and Lee before Cold Harbor. Earlier campaigns of maneuver also had given way to sieges at Vicksburg and elsewhere. Similarly, Furgurson's statement that no other major battle of the War was ""so shamefully one-sided as that in the first week of June 1864, at the country crossroads of Cold Harbor, Virginia"" certainly would provoke lively disagreement. <p> In terms of evidence, Furgurson falls into the trap of using postwar testimony to describe wartime events and attitudes. He suggests that on the evening of June 2 ""every man in both armies knew the grand assault was next,"" supporting this highly questionable assertion with an 1880s quotation from Confederate general Evander M. Law. Law claimed in retrospect, with the advantage of knowing what had transpired on June 3, that he was ""as well satisfied that [the attack] would come at dawn the next morning as if I had seen General Meade's order directing it."" Furgurson also accepts Joshua L. Chamberlain's postwar avowal that for a time after Cold Harbor the Union army ceased to compile routine morning reports of unit strengths because ""the country would not stand it, if they knew"" about the heavy casualties. Elsewhere, Furgurson employs dramatic but questionable quotations, most notably the purported Union diary entry that read: ""June 3, Cold Harbor. I was killed."" <p> These weaknesses do little to diminish Furgurson's accomplishment in writing a balanced, compelling study of an important part of the Overland campaign. After more than a century and a third, Cold Harbor finally has emerged from the shadows of Civil War literature.  <p> <i>Gary W. Gallagher is the John L.

2061	847697223		When in the Course of Human Events: Arguing the Case for Southern Secession		Adams, Charles			"Was the devastation of the War Between the States and the enduring sectional antipathies necessary? Were northern motives as lofty as historians have maintained?<p>Charles Adams is perhaps the world's leading scholar on the history of taxation, as well as author of the bestseller <i>For Good and Evil: The Impact of Taxes on the Course of Civilization</i> (second edition, 1999). Indeed, a short chapter in that book positing strong connection between taxes and the Civil War was a genesis for Adams's extended treatment of the subject in <b>When in the Course of Human Events</b>. Certainly the more- than-30-year wrangle over tariffs prior to the Civil War is well-known. John C. Calhoun believed that federal import tax laws were injurious to the South, a form of tribute exacted from her by the North. Since the South was the great exporting portion of the Union, it paid more than a proportionate share of revenue to the federal government. Moreover, disbursements for ""national"" improvements were decidedly lopsided in favor of the North.<p>By the time Abraham Lincoln was elected, with little southern support, to the presidency, demographic trends were consigning the South to permanent minority status within the Union. The Republican Party was a northern sectional party, and its platform called for high tariffs. To Adams, high tariff obligations to northern industrialists and manufacturers were explicit, and this was more important to Southerners than vague and conflicting northern opposition to slavery. With the Morrill Tariff, the Republican Congress inaugurated a policy of high protectionism in March 1861 that would last for decades. It was the highest tariff yet in American history, with average rates of 47 percent. A de facto ""war of the tariffs"" began when the Confederate Constitution banned high import taxation and essentially created a free trade zone to the south. Monied interests in the North eschewed peaceful secession, since trade would shift from Boston, New York, and Philadelphia to Charleston, Savannah, and New Orleans.<p>Adams roundly impugns the motives of the North. Lincoln's concern for enslaved blacks was more a facade than substance. Northern apologists just needed something more glamorous to fight for than taxes, and emancipation fit the bill. Southern slavery was tolerable -- southern free ports were not. Slavery was an issue that could be negotiated -- tax policy, however, was nonnegotiable. Granted, Lincoln said as much in his First Inaugural: he would not use federal power to prevent states from doing what they wished politically, only ""to collect the duties and impost."" Ft. Sumter was the tax collection base for Charleston Harbor. Other federal properties had been peacefully abandoned and some taken by force, but Lincoln resolved to keep the money maker. Lincoln notified the governor of South Carolina that he would bring in provisions, by force if necessary. Confederate Secretary of State Robert Toombs warned that Southerners were being baited, but they seized the fort before provisions could get there.  <p>Despite commotion and fireworks, no one was actually hurt in the takeover of Fort Sumter. After running out of ammunition, Major Anderson surrendered the fort. The men were sent home, but Lincoln wasted no time in requesting 75,000 volunteers to put down ""rebellion."" The first casualties actually occurred a week later, when volunteers from Massachusetts killed 12 civilians in Baltimore. The Upper South seceded, and war was on for all practical purposes. Besides precipitating the attack on Ft. Sumter and rejecting a negotiated settlement, Lincoln seized dictatorial powers and suspended the Constitution. Unlike Franklin Roosevelt after Pearl Harbor, Lincoln circumvented a constitutional duty to call Congress in the event of an emergency, delaying the meeting for three months. In the meantime, he made decisions that arrogated to himself the power of Congress, courts, and the states. The effect was to commit the nation irrevocably to war for so-called preservation of the Union -- that is to say, preservation of the Union's revenue. <p>International opinion, especially in Britain, was thrown aback with amazement. The American nation had stood squarely for self-determination. Millions of people separating en masse as political states, through elective, representative, and constitutional government, did not resemble rebellion. Rather, it was more like one nation separating from another along contiguous and discernible boundaries -- much like the American Revolution, a colonial secession from the Mother Country. The Declaration of Independence had indeed established secessionist doctrine in universalist terms of language. The words began ""When in the Course of Human Events,"" from which Adams draws his title. John Stuart Mill was one of the few Britons to assign to slavery a causative significance for the War. He also assigned moral imperative to the victory of northern arms. Mill's views, published in Fraser's magazine, may have led to the trans-Atlantic spread of those ideas.  <p>Adams strongly criticizes Lincoln for unilaterally suspending the writ of habeas corpus, probably the most important provision of the Bill of Rights. Lincoln closed over 300 presses and imprisoned tens of thousands of his political opponents. He imposed martial law in the North, enabling military tribunals to convict civilians and to execute them without appeal. Lincoln even tried to arrest the chief justice of the Supreme Court. Adams explains that Jefferson Davis escaped state trial and execution because, notwithstanding Reconstruction, constitutional processes reasserted themselves after the War. Attorneys general and prosecutors concluded that the legal case against secession could not be won in a bona fide court setting. War had settled the issue and trumped legal consideration or antebellum constitutionality.  Finally, Adams indicts Lincoln for shifting responsibility for the War's terrible devastation and his government's tyranny from himself to God, Lincoln's fatalistic Calvinism verging on the ""psychotic."" <p>Adams's critique of Lincoln is not always objective. He can be as shrill as Clement Vallandigham, or the other western Copperheads whom he calls ""peacemakers."" Adams poses questions too often in a rhetorical style, then answers himself with assertions and circumstantial evidence. His commentary on the nature of warfare and the Civil War generation's love-obsession with war is bizarre; his reference to the Minnesota Sioux uprising uninformed. Adams does, however, contribute a much-needed alternative to uncritical Lincoln-adoration in history. He also successfully debunks the simplistic and mythical understanding of the War Between the States as an unqualified moral crusade to end slavery. <p><i>Wesley Allen Riddle is fellow at the National Humanities Institute.</i>"	Riddle, Wesley Allen	Spring 2000	2000-03-01	Review	The cost of the high tariffs and protectionism was war	How green was their volley?

1804	452281393		Gettysburg 1863: Campaign of Endless Echoes	Gettysburg 1863: Campaign of Endless Echoes	Wheeler, Richard			"What makes Gettysburg so constantly engaging? One of America's most decisive battles, it shattered the mythic invincibility surrounding Robert E. Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia, and, along with the fall of Vicksburg, it began the South's long agony to Appomattox. But something more causes rising interest in the Pennsylvania battle: at Gettysburg the past is ""not even past,"" and myths and possibilities seem to haunt history.<p>Gettysburg has attracted much fine writing. Richard Wheeler's <b>Gettysburg 1863</b> ranks with the best. His easy, flowing style lets him tuck in people, scenes, observations, and new information without wrecking the narrative. He lets his characters develop awhile before the battle, and as a result, Lee, Meade, and their important subordinates are real and come off the pages in the crucible of action.<p>Casting a wide lens, Wheeler looks at the Confederate victory at Chancellorsville as perhaps triggering Lee's perception that his army was dauntless. Wheeler follows Union General Joseph Hooker's squirming after Chancellorsville through his replacement by Meade and traces Lee northward in late June 1863. The great cavalry battle at Brandy Station is reconstructed to show how Jeb Stuart's chagrin at this near defeat for the Confederates contributed to his decision to make the unwise wagon raid into Maryland. The lens focuses as the armies concentrate near Gettysburg. Wheeler sets a clear view of the town scene, showing how citizens met the ragged Rebels flooding the streets.<p>Tension mounts at Union and Confederate headquarters as the first and second days of the battle pass in a swirl of hectic fighting, and of chances taken, missed, or debated. The third day fills with oddities as Longstreet opposes a charge against Meade's center. Lee overrules Longstreet's suggestion to turn the Union flank and orders the frontal charge. Flamboyant George Pickett makes ready to lead, while the Rebel artillery begins a fearsome bombardment that roils some of Meade's front line and flails Federal wagon parks and depots -- and nearly empties Rebel caissons.<p>Battle narrative is a special Wheeler gift. Description of the three days' fighting around Gettysburg pulls the reader straight into the sound, fury, and anguish of Culp's Hill, Devil's Den, the Cemetery, and the Round Tops. The charge on July 3 is executed with all the furies of impossible gallantry. Wheeler's lens sweeps the whole of Pickett's Charge and zooms in on men trying to keep formation as they fall, and on the Union line holding steadily against artillery and the awesome mass in gray. Clearly seen are the survivors as they stream down the hill to meet a contrite Lee.<p>Wheeler is careful and sound in his assessment of why Meade did not pursue Lee's troops, despite constant urging from Washington. Although respectful of Lee's retreat from Gettysburg, Wheeler is nevertheless highly critical of Lee's plan and actions during the whole campaign. He reproaches the Confederate leader for permitting Stuart's quixotic raid that left the army without vital intelligence before and during the battle.<p>Scattered throughout the text are line drawings that evoke the period and depict the participants. Wheeler deliberately avoided reference notes because he thought they would only confuse readers. This omission is unfortunate because readers might have enjoyed pursuing new sources presented by the author. The bibliography is helpful (despite some omissions), but footnotes would have been even more helpful.<p><i>Frank E.

1567	1556618409		Sisters of the Confederacy: A Secret Refuge		Snelling, Lauraine			"When Jesselynn Hardwood chops off her locks and dons britches, she is following a long line of Civil War heroines dressed in drag, from the (real-life) Union spy Emma Edmonds to Rita M' Brown's (fictional) Geneva Chatfield. Unlike Geneva, who pretends to be a boy in order to follow her husband into battle, Jesselynn has an odd-and rather implausible-task. Her father, dying from war wounds in 1863, begs Jesse to save the family's horses, at whatever cost. So Jesselynn leaves her beloved Twin Oaks (no, not Twelve Oaks), band of rag-tag newly freed slaves in tow, to drive that passel of horses to safety in Missouri. <p> By the end of <i>Daughter of Twin Oaks</i>, the first installment of Lauraine Snelling's Secret Refuge series, Jesselynn is safely camped out in a Missouri cave, protecting those precious horses. In the sequel, <b>Sisters of the Confederacy</b>, we meet up with Jesselynn again, and we also read about her sister Louisa, waiting out the war at an aunt's house in Virginia. Jesselynn spends another few weeks in Missouri and then hits the Oregon Trail. Louisa, a devoted volunteer at a Confederate hospital, makes a daring trip to Washington, D.C., and smuggles morphine (sewn in the hoops of her skirts, of course) back to Richmond, where she nurses the wounded and mourns the apparent death of her intended. <p> The Secret Refuge series is part of the sub-genre of Christian historical fiction. Christian fiction has been improving by leaps and bounds in the last few years, but you would not know it from reading <i>Daughter of Twin Oaks</i> or <b>Sisters of the Confederacy</b>: the plots crawl, the characters are cardboard, the dialogue stilted.  Whatever their literary demerits, these novels' explicit concern for questions of faith is actually more historically accurate than their secular counterparts, often peopled with folks whose secular sensibilities are better suited to the late 20th century than the mid-19th. After all, as Randall M. Miller, Harry S. Stout, and Charles Reagan Wilson recently noted, ""religion stood at the center of the American Civil War experience."" Trials of faith are every bit as central to Snelling's novels as trials of war. Both Jesse and Louisa are wracked with wartime doubts, both are buoyed by the prayers of others, both have a lively, conversational prayer life. <p> Perhaps <i>Daughters of Twin Oaks</i> and <b>Sisters of the Confederacy</b> will inspire more able novelists to pay attention to faith. <p> <i>Lauren F.

1823	807825441		The Heart of Confederate Appalachia: Western North Carolina in the Civil War		Inscoe, John C.	McKinney, Gordon B.		When traveling west along the North Carolina Piedmont, one sees the Blue Ridge rise abruptly, 3,000 to 5,000 feet, like a giant fortress. This terrain, which is heavily forested, with rushing rivers and deep valleys, is the area covered in <b>The Heart of Confederate Appalachia</b>. This study of western North Carolina, by John C. Inscoe and Gordon B. McKinney, is in part a social history of the mountains' inhabitants, discussing the antebellum period, attitudes about secession, the role of women, the practice of slavery, and economic circumstances. The towns involved are Marshall, Hendersonville, Boone, Waynesville, Warm Springs, Burnsville, and Asheville. With the War+s outbreak, they became host to  great drama involving guerrilla warfare and military conflict. <p>The two dominant personalities on the political scene were Governor Zebulon Vance, an Asheville native and a moderate, and Representative Thomas Clingman, a rabid secessionist. The Western Highlands, along with the rest of North Carolina, went with the Confederacy. Yet within this region, there were pockets of unionists, or tories, as they were called. Because of the isolation of this land, it was vulnerable to local partisan raids, incursions by both armies, and deserters who hid there, living off the land and its people.<p> At one stage, to put down lawlessness in the area, Governor Vance sent the 65th North Carolina Regiment into the mountains. Its men were mostly locals, and they pursued a group of Union partisans who had been on a raid. Thirteen were captured, many of whom were related to one another, and, forced to kneel in groups of three, they were executed, one person at a time, some witnessing the death of a cousin or brother before their turn came. Known today as the Laurel Massacre, the act appalled the Confederate authorities, but, after much remonstrance, no sanction was imposed on those responsible beyond dismissal from Confederate military service. <p>Late in the war, General Grant sent General George Stoneman+s cavalry regiment into western North Carolina with instructions to destroy any land that he came upon but to avoid fighting. As General Sherman tore up eastern North Carolina, Stoneman hit the Highlands hard. A contingent of his cavalry, traveling from Hendersonville to Asheville, was met under a flag of truce by authorities from Asheville. The Union regiment then marched peacefully through Asheville, enroute to East Tennessee. Downstate, Johnston had surrendered, and the War was over.<p>  On the next day, however, the Federals returned and sacked Asheville. The excuse given was that President Johnson had not accepted the peace terms between the combatants at Durham. Observers and historians believe the actual reason for the attack was to plunder. <p><b>The Heart of Confederate Appalachia</b> is good history and should be well-received.  There were no armies marching on a grand scale, only partisan communities struggling-sometimes admirably, on other occasions brutally-for their respective causes. More than once, survival was the goal.  <p><i>Frank Edward Bourne is active in the Knoxville Civil War Roundtable and the Kentucky Civil War Round Table. He interviewed John C.

1483	803210582		General William S. Harney: Prince of Dragoons		Adams, George Rollie			"When William S. Harney retired from the United States Army in 1869 after 51 years of service, he left behind a mixed legacy. Widely acknowledged for his innovative tactics in fighting Indians on the frontier as well as his important contribution to the success of General Winfield Scott's Mexico City campaign in the Mexican War, Harney nonetheless felt obligated to defend himself against potential detractors of his record in Missouri during the 1861 secession crisis. Relieved of command for not assisting pro-Union forces vigorously enough as the state's future hung in the balance, Harney spent the rest of his life fighting the unfair implication that his actions had reflected disloyalty. <p> In <b>William S. Harney: Prince of Dragoons</b>, George Rollie Adams persuasively demonstrates that Harney's entire career was driven by a love for the army and the conviction that he must always follow his conscience even if that meant defying authority. Unfortunately, his convictions were accompanied by what Adams aptly summarizes on page 286 as a ""quick temper, foul mouth, violent nature, vindictive bent, and callous behavior."" That put him in a number of awkward situations over the course of his career, including several courts-martial, but it also reflected a strength of character that served him well in circumstances that might have overwhelmed a lesser man. So, while Harney incurred the wrath of his superiors for precipitating an international crisis with Great Britain over San Juan Island in 1859 and for hesitating in Missouri in 1861, he was instrumental in pacifying the Sioux in 1854-55, returning order to Bleeding Kansas and preparing the Utah expedition in 1857-58, and serving on the Indian Peace Commission after the Civil War. In doing so, he became a pivotal figure in 19th century American military history. <p> Were it not for his tarnished Civil War service, Harney would have found a modern biographer long ago, but Adams's work now more than fills the void. His biography is thoroughly researched, clearly argued, and engagingly written, even if it occasionally asks too much of the reader. For example, the impetuous Harney of the San Juan Island crisis became the cautious Harney of secession-minded Missouri less than two years later. Adams's explanation on page 237 that Harney exercised caution ""because he so intensely desired to avoid destruction of lives and property"" may be true, but it seems out of character for a man whose reputation was both marred and enhanced by his consistent use of violence. Those interested in this aspect of Harney's career may want to look deeper for an explanation. Still, this is a relatively minor quibble. <p>  Adams's biography, which will not soon be surpassed, does a wonderful job of rescuing an important historical figure from relative obscurity. <p> <i>Kurt Hackemer is an assistant professor of history at the University of South Dakota.

As author Ron Soodalter reveals, however, Gordon's story is as much about the only man executed for this crime, as it is the story of the changing political climate of the early 1860s.

1423	873386280		Forgotten Valor: The Memoirs, Journals, & Civil War Letters of Orlando B. Willcox	Forgotten Valor: The Memoirs, Journals, & Civil War Letters of Orlando B. Willcox	Scott, Robert Garth			"While Robert Garth Scott's claim that this is ""the largest collection of Civil War papers to surface in half a century"" may be true, what is certain is that <b>Forgotten Valor</b> is one of the most complete, candid, and compelling memoirs to cover the professional military career of an unsung but stalwart war hero. Orlando Boliver Willcox (1823-1907) served for 44 years in the U.S. Army, most notably as a brevet major general during the Civil War.<p>This massive collection of previously unpublished papers chronicles the military life of an officer who kept meticulous journals, diaries, letters, and copies of his official reports throughout his career. Scott has gathered these sources and produced a stunningly refreshing memoir of an articulate and perceptive man whose writings reveal his military skills, leadership ability, insight, and rather direct sense of humor.<p>After graduating from West Point in 1843, Willcox served in Mexico with Winfield Scott, chased the Plains Indians in Kansas, and pursued the Seminoles in Florida. Army life in those years was dangerous, lonely, and frustrating, with Willcox observing that ""good liquor and good morals are equally scarce."" Although this memoir covers nearly five decades of army service, most of the work is related to Willcox's Civil War years. In 1861, at the outbreak of the War, this Detroit native was appointed colonel of the 1st Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment. He fought at Manassas, in ""one of the best planned but worst fought battles of the Civil War."" Willcox was captured there and later received the Medal of Honor for his bravery on that battlefield.<p>Quickly recognized as a courageous and capable leader, Willcox was rapidly promoted upon his release from a Confederate prison, serving as either a division commander or as commanding general of the Union army's IX Corps for the rest of the War. He and his soldiers fought gallantly at South Mountain, Antietam, Fredericksburg, the Wilderness, Cold Harbor, and Petersburg. While on temporary duty, Willcox also pursued the raider John Hunt Moran in Indiana and fought rebel guerrillas in eastern Tennessee.<p>His descriptions of army life on campaign, in camp, and in battles are vivid and frank. Even a major general complains about slow mail service, infrequent paycalls, and meddling politicians. Willcox is especially wary of ""the heroes of the quill,"" those moralists, journalists, and critics who have never smelled gunpowder or been acquainted with rebel artillery.<p>His remembrances of fellow officers are honest and unvarnished, and particularly interesting are his comments about General Ulysses S. Grant. Willcox is also no stranger to controversy and his thoughts on personal and professional difficulties are bracing and fresh. His sense of humor is best revealed in his ""treatise on modern war,"" which is a skewering spoof of military bureaucracy, red-tape, and single-mindedness.<p>Lengthy, detailed, and heavily footnoted for reference and clarity, <b>Forgotten Valor</b> offers a well-crafted look at an intrepid warrior who devoted his life to the army and his heart to his troops.<p><i>William D.

1396	826212190		Jefferson Davis: Unconquerable Heart		Allen, Felicity			"Why has Jefferson Davis been the subject of so many poor biographies? Over the century since his death, the Confederate president has somehow inspired what is probably the worst overall body of literature of any great figure in American history. With the happy exception of William E. Dodd's brief 1908 biography and William C. Davis's (no relation) excellent and comprehensive 1991 work, attempts to tell the life story of Jefferson Davis have been lame at best. Perhaps the reason for this problem lies in Davis's own nature.<p>Throughout his adult life Davis insisted that only fools or knaves could possibly disagree with him, because he was always right. Having played a large and controversial role in history, and one that was profoundly wrong, he never repented or in any way allowed the possibility of any rightness among those who fought against him to end slavery and save the American experiment in self-government. His rigid claim to justification makes it hard for scholars to handle him with balance. When studying Jefferson Davis, the temptation is strong either to reject him totally or to accept him on his own terms, and this, added to every biographer's perennial temptation to idolize his subject, has been too much for most Davis writers.<p>Felicity Allen meets these temptations with unconditional and immediate surrender. In her preface she deplores the too-negative tone of previous works on Davis, a problem not noticed by most students of the Civil War. Of Hudson Strode's adulatory three-volume work published during the 1950s -- which prompted one scholar to observe, ""Every page reeks of magnolia blossoms"" -- she explains on page xiii that it ""has been overlooked because it lacks scholarly apparatus."" This she sets out to remedy, and indeed, what follows is well over 500 pages of essence of magnolia blossoms"" -- with footnotes.<p>Her first chapter introduces Jefferson Davis by telling the story of his transportation as a prisoner from Georgia to Fort Monroe, Virginia, after his capture at the end of the Civil War. It immediately becomes apparent that the author has done an enormous amount of research. The account is detailed and picturesque. Indeed, it is hard to imagine that anyone, then or since, ever said anything complimentary about Davis that is not included in these pages. Davis is presented as a noble, suffering hero and fares well in comparisons with a whole range of historical figures from the Knights of the Round Table to Jesus Christ.<p>The author then turns to Davis's ancestry and early life, in an account that is detailed, accurate, and familiar to readers of previous Davis biographies. By the time of Davis's West Point sojourn, Allen's own perspective becomes noticeable. Davis simply did no wrong, or at least nothing seriously wrong -- not even in the famous eggnog riot that got him court-martialed. And he certainly was not intoxicated during that affray. The book continues through his army days, his resignation, his marriage, and his taking up of a plantation. Davis was a model officer and was certainly in the right the second time he was court-martialed. Allen recounts Davis's services in the Mexican War (heroic) and as secretary of war (wise and dedicated), but it is her accounts of the political issues of Davis's life during the 1840s and 1850s that are most notable and most disturbing. Allen rails against the abolitionists as evil enemies of the last bastion of Christian civilization, the slaveholding South. Abolitionists, she argues, did not understand slavery and would not have cared about the good of the slaves even if they had been capable of recognizing the slaves' best interests. The well-known evils of the slave system, such as separation of families, she dismisses as myth. The slaves themselves she represents as happy and contented, and, in a nice touch, opines that the passes that slaves had to carry when traveling off the plantation (lest they be picked up by the dreaded slave-patrol) gave the slaves a pleasant feeling of belonging. Congressional legislation that in any way curtailed the free spread of slavery she represents as being a hostile attack upon the people of the South -- as if white Southerners, unlike other mortals, were incapable of living except by the sweat of other men's brows.<p>By the time the reader reaches the sections about secession and the outbreak of the Civil War, Allen's interpretations will not be surprising. When Southerners walked out of the 1860 Democratic convention, <i>they</i> were the <i>national</i> Democrats, while those who remained were the ""rump convention."" The undeniably legal and constitutional election of Abraham Lincoln was an aggression against the South. The outbreak of war as a result of Davis's order to attack Fort Sumter she represents as entirely Lincoln's fault, stating, in blatant falsehood, that Lincoln had intended to insert troops and ammunition into the fort -- rather than food only -- even if Confederates had not opened fire.<p>If all this is, by now, predictable, the account of the War will be more so. The South was noble, virtuous, and brave; the North vile, barbarous, and dominant in numbers of soldiers. Northern numbers eventually smothered Southern valor, though Gettysburg, let it be well marked, was not a Southern defeat. The horrors of Andersonville and other Southern prisons were not the fault of their perpetrators but rather of the North, which refused to exchange prisoners. She neglects to mention that this was because the South insisted on treating as slaves those United States soldiers who had black skins. Through all this she depicts Davis as sage and heroic; his friends and supporters, good; his critics, beneath contempt.<p>With Davis's capture near Washington, Georgia, the story comes full circle to where the book began. Allen then proceeds to devote more than one-eighth of the book's length to an astonishingly detailed account of Davis's two-year imprisonment in Fort Monroe, including detailed parsing of his letters from the fort and of the marginal comments he jotted in his reading material. She characterizes his treatment there as torture, because the food and accommodations were not to his liking and because, being very sensitive, he was kept awake by the tread of nearby sentries. Even his brief stint wearing manacles somehow failed to create that pleasant sense of belonging allegedly enjoyed by the erstwhile slaves. Through this section and the subsequent account of Davis's later years, Allen stresses the Southern theme of that time depicting Davis as a Christ-figure who suffered vicariously, in this case, not for the sins of his people but as a propitiation to their persecutors.<p>This is hagiography -- literally -- despite the fact that the author has no doubt combed vast numbers of pages in search of the praise she repeats and that she does so in a pleasant writing style. There may be some value in depicting the world of Jefferson Davis from his own perspective -- wherein he was always right -- but this work flatly fails to present the fair and reasonably objective account of the subject's life and times that one hopes to find in good biography. Once again, Jefferson Davis has baffled the biographers.<p><i>Steven E. Woodworth is author of </i>Jefferson Davis and His Generals<i> and </i>Davis and Lee at War<i>.

2111	684833379		Lincoln's Men: How President Lincoln Became Father to an Army and a Nation	Lincoln's Men: How President Lincoln Became Father to an Army and a Nation	Davis, William C.			"William C. Davis, who has authored numerous fine works on American Civil War topics, has written another impressive one entitled, <b>Lincoln's Men: How President Lincoln Became Father to an Army and a Nation</b>, which helps us answer one of the most pertinent, and arguably one of the most fundamental questions which any people, and their historians may ever ask: ""What, if anything, is unique or exceptional about our nation?"" <p>There are several different approaches, but this question is best answered by studying those individuals whom the nation reveres as national heroes. England has her Alfred the Great, France her Napoleon, and Germany her Bismark. And in America, there is Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln stands apart as not only our most popular president, but also our most popular American. By studying him, or rather by studying what Americans revere in him, one can gain a better grasp of the uniqueness or exceptionalism of America.<p>Davis's study focuses on the Union soldier's opinions of Abraham Lincoln. In developing this work, Davis researched 600 manuscript collections and 200 or more published sets of wartime diaries and letters. One may wonder, as some did in respect to James McPherson's work in this field, whether these sources best represent the opinions and ideas of the 2 million who served in blue. <p>Like McPherson before him, Davis admits that some were illiterate, maybe 30 percent, but that one cannot study the opinions of those who left no records. Historians can only make conclusions from what remains, and these diaries and letters give us insight into the soldiers' opinions better than anything else that we have. Both Davis and McPherson should be complimented for developing a convincing answer to the question of what, if anything, is unique or exceptional about the United States.<p>The soldiers' opinions on several controversial issues provide overwhelming evidence that they revered Lincoln more than they revered any of their contemporaries. While some soldiers reacted negatively to Lincoln's dismissal of McClellan, his issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation, and his 1864 campaign, the majority supported the president through all of these events. The soldiers appreciated McClellan's organization of the army but exhibited greater appreciation for Lincoln's leadership. They approved of the Proclamation, although not altogether out of egalitarian impulses. They were more likely to applaud the document as another weapon in the Union's arsenal. And for the 1864 election, the vast majority of soldiers voted for Lincoln and firmly applauded his re-election.<p>According to Davis, the soldiers supported Lincoln because Lincoln supported them. Throughout the war, Lincoln visited troops in the field and in hospitals, and warmly greeted them in the White House without any prior appointment. The soldiers well knew that, on an almost weekly basis, he spared the lives of soldiers condemned to death, as he preferred to show mercy rather than punishment. They appreciated his steadfast determination to save the nation and to finish the war. Lincoln's actions towards his soldiers enhanced his reputation so that, as Davis astutely concludes, they referred to him not as President Lincoln, but as ""Father Abraham."" <p>Lincoln transcended the title of his office, becoming something more dear, more personal, and more revered than any of their generals or any other American.<p>Although Davis's summaries of the soldiers' opinions more than adequately provide the reader with a strong sense of their views, it might be interesting to know the exact number of soldiers who commented on each pivotal event and what percentage supported Lincoln's actions and what percentage did not. It would also be fascinating to know if Union soldiers from certain states were more likely to applaud Lincoln's actions or despise them and the number of soldiers who opposed emancipation at the beginning of the war but approved of it by the end. As a slice of 19th century American society, these soldiers' opinions, if studied in this manner, would substantially enrich our understanding of the Civil War.<p>This point aside, Davis has produced a fine work, which is easily read and thoroughly informative. For anyone who has an interest in Abraham Lincoln, especially how he related to his soldiers, this is a must read. And for those who have an interest in knowing what is exceptional or unique about America, this work provides voluminous information on America's most popular hero and highlights some of those qualities for which Abraham Lincoln was revered.<p><i>Timothy S.

The main character of the book is Jacob Hansen, who pulls triple-duty as the sheriff, undertaker, and pastor of Friendship, Wisconsin. As such, he has taken on the responsibility of counseling the townspeople from the pulpit, scolding and punishing them when they stray and preparing their bodies when they die. All the while, he is haunted by memories of the War.<p>Indeed, the War invades every facet of Hansen's life, influencing everything from how he trims his beard (he follows the fashion of his regiment's captain) to what transportation he takes (he feels compelled to use bicycles and railway handcars for transportation because the gruesome wartime experience of taking shelter inside the carcass of his horse to survive a Rebel siege has produced an inescapable repugnance for horses).<p>In the first chapter, O'Nan masterfully uses Hansen's trip to investigate a report of a dead man on a farmer's property and the thoughts running through Hansen's mind to introduce the town and the cast of characters, while foreshadowing all that is yet to come. When the doctor concludes that diphtheria caused the man's death, Hansen places his responsibility to the town above all else. Even though the disease spreads rapidly, he hesitates to implement a full quarantine and convinces his wife to remain, rather than flee to a safe distance with their newborn daughter, because he does not want to induce a panic. As the death toll rises and an unstoppable wildfire looms in the distance, the pressure on Hansen builds to a level both mentally and emotionally unbearable, leading to a final staggering revelation.<p><b>A Prayer for the Dying</b> is a Midwestern gothic that unmercifully explores how much emotional pain and suffering one man can endure, and, if he survives, the cost to his sanity and his faith. In short, Stewart O'Nan has combined the depth of Camus and Faulkner with the pure readability of Stephen King to produce an exceedingly literate and satisfying page-turner all his own.<p><i>Thomas Hill received an M.A. in history from Oklahoma State University and is currently working toward an M.F.A. in writing at the University of Memphis.</i>	Hill, Thomas	Fall 1999	1999-09-01	Review	A gothic depiction of one veteran's elusive peace	The unquiet memory	Henry Holt	0000-00-00				"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=241 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/ONanPrayerforDying.jpg"">"					
1806	1883522153		Red-Tape and Pigeon-Hole Generals: Andrew A. Humphreys in the Army of the Potomac	Red-Tape and Pigeon-Hole Generals: Andrew A. Humphreys in the Army of the Potomac	Armstrong, William H.	Arner, Frederick B.		With <b>Red-Tape and Pigeon-Hole Generals</b>, Fred Arner has established himself as a champion of the Army of the Potomac's downtrodden and an assailant of its legendary elite. In a previous work, <i>Mutiny at Brandy Station</i>, Arner dissected the causes and personalities associated with an uprising in the Union Third Corps during the winter of 1864 -- an analysis that reflected warmly on the common soldiers and poorly on the subordinate command of the Army of the Potomac. In <b>Red-Tape and Pigeon-Hole Generals</b>, Arner continues the trend, resurrecting a scathing assessment of Andrew Humphreys (one of the Union cause's most respected figures) written by one of Humphreys's contemporaries.<p>Most historians have long consigned <b>Red-Tape and Pigeon-Hole Generals</b> (written anonymously in 1864) to the bin of fiction. The book contains unidentified characters in a fictionalized regiment commanded by fictionalized officers. Why the anonymous author chose this approach becomes clear in the first few chapters: published in wartime, this is an unvarnished, harsh recounting of the relationship between a mercurial regular army officer (Humphreys, although not named in the text) and the nation's volunteer fighters, the very core of the Union war effort. Without its fictive pretense, this work would have been an enormous indictment of the army's management at a time when the North -- split deeply by political division -- could least afford it.<p>Fred Arner has done diligent and useful work to peel away the veil of fiction that has obscured this book. He identifies the regiment in question: the 129th Pennsylvania, a nine-month regiment that saw heavy service in the East from Antietam to Chancellorsville. He reveals the author (Lieutenant Colonel William H. Armstrong of the 129th), the major protagonists (Colonel Jacob Frick of the 129th and his Pennsylvania Volunteers), and the primary antagonist, Major General Andrew Atkinson Humphreys, commander of the division of nine-month Pennsylvania Volunteers and later chief of staff of the army.<p>With the characters established, the book is transformed from a seemingly mindless diatribe against a vile general and his Regular Army cohorts into an important book that reflects -- perhaps more vividly than any other -- the tension between old army discipline and new, eager, and often slack volunteer soldiers.<p>The reader must, however, beware. The long recounting of conversations are a sure sign that they are fabricated or loosely reconstructed -- not to be relied upon. Also, Arner, in his ardor to embrace the indictment of Humphreys portrayed here, is considerably less keen on presenting favorable testimony about the general than he ought to be (there is much such material out there, to be sure). This is no balanced assessment. Still, it is a useful piece of work and interesting reading that ought to find a place on the shelf of anyone interested in the Army of the Potomac.<p><i>John Hennessy, author of </i>Return to Bull Run<i>, writes from Fredericksburg, Virginia.</i>	Hennessy, John	Fall 1999	1999-09-01	Review	One common soldier's satire of the Union officer corps	The Humphreys nobody knows	Rockbridge Publishing	0000-00-00				"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=244 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/RedTapePigeons.jpg"">"

2100	838637531		Gangrene and Glory: Medical Care During the American Civil War	Gangrene and Glory: Medical Care During the American Civil War	Freemon, Frank R.			With a degree in medicine and a doctorate in American history, Frank Freemon brings a unique perspective to the topic of Civil War medicine, as he earlier demonstrated in <i>Microbes and  Minie Balls: An Annotated Bibliography of Civil War Medicine</i>.<p>His new work, <b>Gangrene and Glory</b>, covers a broad topic in an easy-to-read style that any Civil War medical layman can understand. It is a superb work. The reader receives enough in-depth information to receive a clear understanding, without an overload of detail, of what occurred medically during this era. Thus the book will appeal to those who have a background in Civil War medicine and those who do not.<p>Structurally, the book intersperses narration with series of anecdotes and analyses. Freemon, who believes that things happen in a parallel rather than in a linear fashion, has written each chapter from a different viewpoint. For example, the chapter on Gettysburg is presented from the perspective of the wounded soldier, while the chapter on the Vicksburg campaign is written as if it were a scientific paper, analyzing the causes of illness using medical knowledge of the period. <p>Incorporated into the text are events that marked the growth, development, and trials of the Union and Confederate medical organizations designed to improve the health of the soldier and aid the wounded.<p><b>Gangrene and Glory </b>uses information that was available to the doctors of the era, avoiding what the author considers to be the most common defect of medical history -- judgment of historical individuals by later standards. Even readers without a medical background can appreciate the work as a series of medical mysteries. How did yellow fever spread from a ship in harbor to afflict people on shore when no one left the ship? What horrible new disease, never seen before by any doctor in the area, took a man from normal at breakfast to feverish at noon, prostrate with spots all over his body by supper, and dead by nightfall? <p>Freemon uses excellent tables, illustrations, and seldom seen photographs to enhance his readable text. One table shows all the medical schools in America in 1860, including their proper names, locations, and number of faculty members and students. Another lists the military medical officers who left the Unites States Army and joined the Confederate States Army. The book also includes sections on Navy medicine and the hospital ship system which are either briefly mentioned in other works or entirely omitted.<p>Even those familiar with the two Civil War medical explanatory classics <i>Doctors in Blue</i> and <i>Doctors in Gray</i> should not make the assumption that they have no need to read this book. A wonderful adjunct to these two classics and deserving shelf space next to them, <b>Gangrene and Glory</b> demonstrates how medical thought and institutions changed over the course of the war. The book is a story of imperfect human beings who struggled to save lives while supporting their respective causes and contending against the enemy, their superiors, and strange afflictions that defied understanding.<p><i>JaNeen M.

2032	873513878		Minnesota in the Civil War: An Illustrated History		Carley, Kenneth	Moe, Richard	Horrigan, Brian	"With this book, the Minnesota Historical Society Press announces its return to Civil War publishing. That is good news. As Richard Moe points out in his introduction, although the state sent fewer than 20 regiments to the war, they fought everywhere. As a result, the Society has a wealth of material to share. <p> The original version of <b>Minnesota in the Civil War</b> was published in 1961 as a collection of newspaper articles written by Kenneth Carley, the editor of <i>Minnesota History</i>. It briefly described the action seen by Minnesota regiments during the war. Although long out-of-print, it is regularly available in catalogues. <p> I once mentioned to Ken that his book was again available from Morningside.<p> ""What do they want for it?"" he asked.<p> ""Twelve dollars.""<p> ""Too much.""<p> What, then, would he have thought of a $50.00 edition? He would probably have liked it, despite its price, for this is so much more than a reprint of his book. <p> Rather than merely making Carley's work more widely available, the Society has elected to use this book to showcase its impressive collection of Civil War material. The edition is delightfully illustrated with pictures of items in the Society's holdings, from flags and swords to sewing kits and surgical instruments. It is filled with photographs and drawings of the soldiers and the places where they fought. <p> The most important additions are the letters and diaries, which complement the original text by introducing more battles and units. This primary source material, from civilians and soldiers, is used to acquaint the reader with the common soldier's experience. The Sanitary Commission, black soldiers, prisons, disease, chaplains, musicians, and much more are also touched upon. <p> As with Carley's text, this supplemental material does not go into much depth. What was once a primer on Minnesota regiments has become a primer on the war. The sections are short and very readable. Students of the war may not find much new information here, but there is much of interest. The editors have selected and edited well. <p> A drummer boy's description of the reaction of the Second Minnesota the first time it heard the long roll-""Some of the men were so excited they did not pull on their shoes. They fought in their stocking feet all day.""-is paired nicely with a private's description of his attempts to get his boots on when the drum beat began. Descriptions of hardtack are commonplace in the literature, but a recipe for hardtack pudding may be unique. The frustration and outrage of members of the Third Minnesota at being surrendered at the First Battle of Murfreesboro comes through clearly. <p> Though not a ""must have,"" this handsome volume is an excellent introduction to the war, especially for Minnesotans, but also for others. <p> <i>Steven Thompson is a past president of the Twin Cities Civil War Round Table and a former editor of its newsletter.

A seasoned booklover sometimes scoffs at such use of ""artistic license."" However, books written for children that employ this technique can prove successful and educational. <p> In <b>Young Heroes of Gettysburg</b>, William Thomas Venner effectively weaves very human situations around the events of early July 1863. We witness the battle and its consequences through the eyes of ""children"" dressed for combat and others who simply lived where the armies met.

Venner, whose six previous books on the Civil War include the best-selling <i>19th Indiana Infantry at Gettysburg</i>, is well suited to author this novel. <p> The first paragraph captures the attention of the young reader. Three teenaged boys, Johnny, Ben, and Sam-all members of Indiana's 19th regiment-are not engaged in what one might expect to be soldiery work. They are successfully completing a calculated plot to take chickens from a farm near their campsite. Then Annie and Rachel, 13- and 12-year-old cousins who live in Gettysburg, are introduced. The distant gunfire heard while the girls tend Annie's horse that summer morning shortly will change all the children's lives. These central characters are immediately humanized, so that a young reader can readily identify with them. <p> Initially, the girls experience the excitement and concerns that stir a town in the way of two opposing forces. The boys, though veterans, feel anticipation of their own as they march toward another bloody showdown. <p> When the battle commences, it takes a back seat to the lives of our young heroes. The boys and girls are in a situation that affords little time to youthful innocence. Though the three boys and their comrades are seasoned, apprehension dominates their thoughts. The enemy is visible and anxious. The sounds are deafening. The wounds are painful and the aftermath tragic. Annie's and Rachel's struggles parallel those of the young soldiers. They meet new friends, face death and incomprehensible loss, and witness lonesomeness and destruction. Yet the girls find the strength to cope and adjust when necessary. The southern boys who come to their house are charmed by Annie and Rachel with protective hospitality, and the girls help ease the pain of the wounded gathered in and around the town's courthouse.  <p> Venner's plot provides opportunities for real emotion and for attempts to do what is best. The reader is propelled through <b>Young Heroes of Gettysburg</b> by a desire to simply know what happens. Pictures presented in the opening chapter add to the bond between reader and characters, and the ""Author's Note"" and bibliography at the end of the book give inspiration for further study. <p> Young adults will enjoy the story and appreciate the history. For many, <b>Young Heroes of Gettysburg</b> will be the book they reference when asked later: ""How did you become interested in the Civil War?"" <p> <i>George McNamara publishes two Civil War-related newsletters,</i> The Children's Chronicle <i>and the</i> Dr. Samuel A.

Lawrence			"You cannot have an army without music,"" Robert E. Lee once observed. Music was inextricably linked to every aspect of a soldier's life, whether he was involved in military duties or at leisure. It connected the soldier to his home and those at home to his victory, his complaints, and his travails. Music rallied the common citizen to acts of patriotism and personal sacrifice, whether on the field of battle or on the home front. In <b>Singing the New Nation</b>, E. Lawrence Abel examines the South's social history through its often overlooked and seldom discussed musical heritage. In his clear, crisp narrative style, Abel introduces an area ripe for renewed study.<p>Unlike many of the other volumes on music of the Civil War, Abel eschews the more common format of simply printing the music and lyrics of songs from the period without background. Instead he chooses several songs dear to the hearts of Southern ancestors and artfully places them in a historical context that expands our appreciation for the lyrics, the times, and the people who sang them.<p>Music provided a constant in the uncertain life of the common soldier. The presence of the fifer and the drummer provided soldiers with a routine that defined their day. The brass band entertained and provided a boost to patriotism and emotion. Some regiments even had their own glee clubs. And the common soldier and the officer alike sang on the march and in camp. Songs, whether patriotic or melancholy lyrics of home, lifted the spirits of the men and helped them remember why they risked their lives for ""The Cause.""<p><b>Music as a measure of social history</b><p>Abel introduces readers to the songwriters and the song-publishing business in the South. But the strength of the volume is in its treatment of music as a measure of social history. <b>Singing the New Nation</b> conveys the important role that music played in the collective lives of those who sacrificed so much. We understand that song can be a change agent.<p>We understand that song can elevate the spirits. We understand that song can soothe and challenge and electrify. And we can, if we listen very closely, hear the few, the happy few, ""the band of brothers"" singing their way through the elation and victory, the boredom and melancholy, and the despair and defeat of those tumultuous years.<p><i>Meg Galante-DeAngelis teaches at the University of Connecticut.
