6419			Poor White Political Identity During Reconstruction (and Beyond)		Edwards, Gary			" 	<p>The 2016 Presidential election had many unexpected consequences and another that could be added to the list is renewed interest in a comparative historical perspective on the politics of poor white Americans.  While this is not an essay about why many rural impoverished whites supported Donald Trump, it does begin with the reinforcing premise that the past always informs the present while the present often determines the questions we ask about the past.  Recent and timely books by J.D. Vance and Nancy Isenberg, <i>Hillbilly Elegy</i> and <i>White Trash</i>, have respectively inspired more public introspection on the role of this class in our society.  With that in mind, the political identity of contemporary poor white Americans has garnered greater attention.   Thus placing this socio-economic group in the fullest historical context would seem to be a more relevant intellectual exercise than ever before.</p>    <p>Poor whites have long been the most difficult social class to study in Southern history.  In the antebellum era they comprised a substantial percentage of the population but still left remarkably little evidence.  During Reconstruction it could be argued that they were rendered even more mysterious as they were momentarily eclipsed by the new marginalized class of freedmen.  Consequently the great political struggle in the postbellum era was the contest between Southern elites and recently emboldened political constituencies that impeded the return to an antebellum status quo.  There is still much to learn about poor whites during Reconstruction but much of what we currently know is based on either plausibility or extrapolation from our knowledge of other groups.  Situating poor whites within the narrative of broader political struggle is largely an intuitive endeavor.  In light of this, poor white political identity may best be understood in an interpretative paradigm rooted in contingency.  Specifically, their political expression was bound up in the contingent variables of their precarious survival much as it had been during the antebellum era. </p>    <p>Any discussion of poor white political identity in the nineteenth-century must first define them as a class and then offer some theory as to how such a marginalized group expressed their politics.  As to definition, poor whites were the 20 to 30 percent of landless inhabitants from the antebellum era whose numbers increased during the postbellum economic collapse.  But beyond the obvious variable of landlessness, it would be useful to invoke the binary framework employed by David Brown which divides this impoverished class between ""vagabonds"" and ""aspirational yeomen.""  These terms provide a self-evident meaning between truly marginal, sometimes criminal, poor whites and those who attempted to use the socio-economic system as it existed.  Vagabonds generally lived on the fringe of formal political expression and often had not voted due to either crime or extensive mobility which left them unable to establish residency and vote with any consistency.  Antebellum voter participation was generally above 70 percent and even higher for local contests although the unengaged segment of the electorate was most likely the poorest.   Poor whites who aspired to join the yeomanry, however, were more likely to have aligned with the antebellum Whigs and later the Constitutional Unionists during secession.  During the war itself, numerous studies have concluded that poor whites were no more than tepid southern nationalists as political identity devolved into those who either supported or opposed the Confederacy.  It is also important to remember that the post-war period created some newly ""poor"" out of the antebellum yeomanry as farm tenancy spread across the region.  It is likely that many of this group would have been old-style Jacksonian Democrats whose growing percentage within the ranks of impoverished make it even more difficult to categorize the political identity of poor whites overall.  Consequently, the immediate postbellum political order offered no obvious ally for members of a burgeoning non-elite class destined to grow larger still but lacking in uniform political identifiers.<sup>1</sup></p>    	<p>If there was a uniform characteristic it was that poor white political identity was always tethered to race.  This had been the case in the slave South before the Civil War and this remained essentially true after.  Indeed, racial solidarity could be argued as the definitive thread that tied the antebellum and postbellum political identity of poor whites together.  In the antebellum period politicians rallied southerners with impassioned diatribes on white liberty over black enslavement, during the postbellum period these condensed into the pithy slogan of a ""white man's government"" but the ultimate goals always seemed the same.  However, the hierarchy of race was never as rigid for poor whites as it was for elites and this always represented a political wild card which presented new possibilities during Reconstruction and beyond.  In the Old South poor whites often encountered slaves and free blacks in a clandestine social terrain of secret exchanges at the expense of the planter class.  Such exchanges were rooted in a tacit understanding that planters controlled slaves and poor whites either directly or indirectly.  However, these encounters were a double-edged blade of cooperation and contempt in which entrenched racism always gave poor whites the upper hand.  The postbellum world offered the potential that poor whites and poor blacks might continue their contingent cooperation in new ways based on the evolving political status of the freedmen.  However, elites could usually trump this racial wild card by pandering to poor white racism whenever expedient.  Sufficient evidence of this can be found in the expressed views of antebellum poor whites such as those famously interviewed by Frederick Law Olmstead who reported in the 1850s that poor whites in the non-plantation regions were remarkably open to the idea of a policy of black emancipation if it was coupled with black expulsion.  This forever placed poor whites at odds with planters as to the ultimate destiny of a black laboring class in a post-slave south.  Yet it gave elites an angle from which to argue for poor whites to support racial solidarity as a bulwark against societal instability.  Anecdotal evidence supports this idea as some studies have found that landless whites comprised about one-third of those convicted of racialized terrorism, roughly equal to the percentage of poor whites in the general population, during the height of federal prosecution of the Ku Klux Klan. <sup>2</sup></p>     	<p>Ultimately, the best method for uncovering the inner motivations for such an underrepresented group may be through the creative interpretation of a cross section of the few poor whites who actually left significant documentation behind.  One such evocative example from my own research could serve as a case in point -- William Tapley Mays was a poor white hog driver and aspiring carpenter from Dyer County, Tennessee.  A Constitutional Unionist in 1860, Mays was unprovoked by the existence of a Republican administration before or after the Civil War.  Indeed by the late antebellum era he was already empathetic toward enslaved individuals, even tacitly acknowledging their personhood while nominally open to the notion of emancipation.  But when his cousins and neighbors joined the secessionists he followed as a matter of contingent personally loyalty rather than ideology.  He was a long-suffering but disgruntled Confederate who switched sides after his capture in 1865.  Becoming a ""galvanized Yankee"" he served with distinction in Utah and returned to Dyer County in 1866 where he slept with a gun by his bed for several years.  But for the most part he lived a public existence among his kin and antebellum acquaintances although by the twentieth-century he had moved 50 miles east to a staunchly Unionist and now Republican area.  Mays was remarkably pliable in his politics as he seemed willing to have accepted an independent Confederate nation even if it had comprised a sizeable free population of black landowners.  Alongside them would have been an enlarged class of new yeomen, comprised of veterans such as himself, also endowed with lands presumably taken from the public domain.  Mays was essentially comfortable with the either the old Whig vision of squatter sovereignty or the new political platform of free soil abolitionism as long as it meant economic opportunity.  However, this was completely antithetical to the Confederate vision of 1861 but also impossible in the Reconstruction South.  Thus many poor whites probably passed through the long post-war era in a manner similar to Mays -- willing to embrace dramatic changes within the antebellum hierarchies of race and class but unable to affect them in a tangible way.<sup>3</sup></p>    	<p>At the conclusion of Reconstruction the political identity of poor whites could be described as either dormant or perhaps in stasis, still awaiting the release of its fullest kinetic energy as the so-called Redeemers reshaped the New South.  These included new laws which ended year-round hunting and economic changes spurred by the expansion of the southern railroad network.  Consequently, poor whites lost their ability to earn even a meager subsistence through taking game and driving hogs.  By the end of the nineteenth-century additional laws closed the open-range and effectively extinguished the last remnants of antebellum squatter culture.  Poor whites either escaped to the West or resigned themselves to the lifestyle of farm tenants or company mill and mine workers.   However, if we imagine the longest interpretive view of Reconstruction as a protracted post-war era, it is possible to comprehend the intermittent discharge of poor whites' political kinetic energy across the largest swath of time.</p>      <p>Ultimately, poor whites like William Mays and others remained ready to support interventionist Federal economic policies like the antebellum American System of the Whigs, postbellum land redistribution of the Radical Republicans, and eventually the reformist demands of bi-racial populism that sporadically appeared well into the twentieth-century.  This culminated in one of the greatest political expressions ever formulated by impoverished whites, the Southern Tenant Farmers Union, an extensive group of black and white sharecroppers who were the ironic victims of the well-intentioned but misguided Federal  attempt to help poor farmers via the Agricultural Adjustment Act.  Arguably World War II and a prosperous post-war suburbanism offered rural poor whites a distraction through an idealized economic goal that at least appeared possible.  But they were again rallied by elites with a renewed cry of a ""white man's government"" albeit this time in reaction to the deconstruction of Jim Crow.  Thus proving that poor whites could still be a political wild card but also diverted away from new identities by old slogans that compelled racial solidarity.  Since that time an intermittently sputtering economy since the post-Vietnam era has arguably marginalized contemporary poor whites as much as any other group which brings us back to Vance and Isenberg.  Thus the contemporary political identity of poor whites may evoke a consistent theme across 175 years.  That is that their politics have long been dominated by the contingency of a precarious existence combined with the unusual choices of creating allies or enemies from the racial minorities within their midst.  Running through it all is an undercurrent that is antithetical to elite southern conservatism as impoverished whites have often supported expansive federal power if it addressed the contingent politics of the moment.</p>    <p><i>Gary T.

Carson <b>Publisher:</b> Cambridge University Press <b>Retail Price:</b> $33.99 <b>ISBN:781107030145 </b> </p>    <p>Most people describe Abraham Lincoln as a genuinely good man.  The author treats Abraham Lincoln through the lens of the private man and the public Lincoln.  Lincoln emerges ethically unscarred.  Like William Lee Miller's <i>Lincoln's Virtues: An Ethical Biography</i>, Lincoln's statesmanship was based on what Miller called ""moral realism.""  And Carson's book, too, comes to the same conclusion.  A philosopher, Carson, an expert on moral relativism, concludes that Lincoln was a good and morally virtuous person even with honest errors of judgment. </p>   <p>The author uses hundreds of Lincoln's own sentiments to prove his case and the author is not afraid to address objections and charges against Lincoln.  There is a long list of Lincoln's ""moral sins,"" his slow evolution for abolition, his vehement support of the fugitive slave law for political reasons  (he did not want to hurt the fledgling Republican Party), and colonization of freed blacks to Africa. </p>    <p>Yet, the author judges Lincoln's admirable qualities -- kindness, humor, generosity, and most notably, mercy -- against his personal failings as husband, father, and son. </p>   <p>Not to be missed is Carson's examination of Lincoln's views on slavery and race.

6573	807164976	$49.95	The Guerrilla Hunters: Irregular Conflicts during the Civil War		(ed.) McKnight, Brian D.	(ed.) Myers, Barton		" A New Collection on Civil War Guerrillas<p>The essays in this collection continue the conversation started by Michael Fellman, Robert R. Mackey, and especially Daniel E. Sutherland. Fellman's <i>Inside War</i> (1989) emphasized how the guerrilla war in Missouri broke down expectations of civilized behavior and unleashed personal and cultural chaos. He raised several issues central to this volume: why guerrilla war was ignored, how social values were destroyed, how women were at risk as both victims and participants, how lines between combatants and noncombatants were blurred, and how war devolved into cycles of revenge and blood sport. Robert R. Mackey's 2004 <i>Uncivil War</i> lays out a three-part definition of irregular war. Guerrilla or people's war was fought outside the expected rules of war by self-constituted outfits fighting when and where they pleased, and often veering toward criminality. Partisan war was waged by small elite conventional units fighting in unconventional ways. Conventional cavalry were often used as raiders behind enemy lines, disrupting communications and supply lines. Distinctions among such men as William Quantrill, John S. Mosby, and Nathan Bedford Forrest are important to these essays. And finally, Daniel E. Sutherland's argument (A <i>Savage Conflict</i>, 2009) that the guerrilla war was decisive in the Confederacy's defeat is the most important interpretation at stake in <i>The Guerrilla Hunters</i>.</p> <p>Kenneth W. Noe's Foreword ably lays out the three goals of this valuable collection. First, it confronts the still current view that the guerrilla war was a mere sideshow. Second, it demonstrates that there was great human diversity in the guerrilla conflict. Some guerrillas were motivated by beliefs in slavery or states' rights, others by defense of kin and community, others by revenge or profit, and some by criminal psychopathy. Third, the collection deals with the problem of defining a guerrilla. Several essays use the definitions supplied by Columbia professor Francis Lieber to Henry Halleck. To Lieber, legitimate soldiers were in uniform, recognized by their government, and under its orders. But, as Noe points out and these essays confirm, men could desert from and return to conventional units, guerrilla outfits could sometimes fight alongside regular forces, and both regulars and irregulars could use the same tactics and commit the same atrocities. Noe demonstrates how Gen. George Crook, USA, who led troops at Antietam but also hunted down ""savages"" in the (West) Virginia mountains, engaged in both conventional and nonconventional combat. These essays show that enlisted men could do the same.</p><p>The editors' introduction argues that Confederate apologists stifled the memory of the guerrilla war because the fact that Unionists, deserters, and draft resisters were fighting a desperate war for survival all over the South would undermine ""Lost Cause"" narratives. Dissent had no place in stories where communities rallied to a man in defense of their beloved Southland (I'm paraphrasing an Appalachian county history). The editors believe that these essays expand the boundaries of military history to include combatants and noncombatants, but also by doing ""history from the bottom up"" place guerrillas in their proper social context -- the people's war, the war most Southerners knew.</p> <p>Barton A. Myers's study of the petitions of would-be commanders of partisan rangers to the Confederate War Department reveals that ranger service appealed strongly to Southern individualism and idealized self-images. The Partisan Ranger Act aimed to keep irregular warfare enthusiasts in uniform and within a chain of command, and therefore entitled to the same prisoner of war rights as regulars. However, many men thought that the act sanctioned any kind of guerrilla fighting, and while John S. Mosby's 43rd Virginia Cavalry Battalion was a conspicuous success, overwhelmingly the guerrillas unleashed by the act brought devastation all over the South. Ranger units competed with the regular military for volunteers, rangers tended to forage friend and foe, and ranger acts of war provoked Union retaliation that disrupted the communities they had hoped to defend.</p><p>Brian D. McKnight's essay on the shadowy Appalachian guerrilla also stresses his complexity. Some irregulars had formal training, fought alongside regulars, and accepted Confederate aims; others sniped at their foes when and where they pleased. He denies that guerrillas were ignorant poor whites; rather, they were frequently men who knew the issues central to the war and who had a stake in Confederate victory. McKnight modifies Mackey's definitions of nonconventional warfare to emphasize bushwhackers, and notes that race wars with Indians and Mexicans provided precedents for spectacular guerrilla atrocities. He emphasizes that guerrillas, though violent paranoics, were also pragmatic opportunists who, by operating outside military structure, could vent their frustrations on others at will. Finally, he stresses a common theme in these essays: isolated acts of violence were how most civilians experienced the war.</p>  <p>Two of these essays focus on individuals who, in very different ways, challenge the definition of the term ""guerrilla."" Brian Steel Wills reminds us that Nathan Bedford Forrest, often called a guerrilla by his enemies, insisted that he was simply a regular Confederate officer who used unconventional tactics. Forrest used his frightening reputation to bluff lesser opponents, excelled at seizing the initiative, and exercised his rustic sense of honor against people he thought were incapable of honor -- like slaves or Unionist renegades.  These values contributed to the massacre perpetrated by his uncontrollable troopers at Fort Pillow and the murder of sleeping Union soldiers after Forrest's defeat at Selma. And Wills points out that Forrest's penchant for acting on his own bought him a tactically brilliant victory at Brice's Crossroads at the expense of the Confederacy's Atlanta campaign. Yet Forrest himself equated guerrillas with plunderers who damaged the Confederate war effort, and emphatically rejected the idea of continuing the war by guerrilla means. Adam Dombey, writing about John Gatewood, who has been accepted as a successful rebel guerrilla in the no man's land of late-war north Georgia and East Tennessee, reveals him to have been simply a sociopathic freebooter and murderer -- what Dombey calls, in modern terms, a warlord, an individual who controls a region through violence and patronage to his own benefit. Rewarding his men with spoils taken from Southern citizens, avoiding Federal forces, never cooperating with the Confederate military, and attacking those who opposed his local dominance, he meets no definition of a guerrilla. Indeed, as Southern soldiers deserted to protect their families from his ravages, he actually hurt the Southern cause.</p> <p>Stephen Rockenbach's essay on Kentucky ""home rebels"" -- men who had accepted Lincoln's offer of amnesty but had used it as a cover for continued violent opposition to the Union cause -- emphasizes their political goals.  In the summer of 1864, a decidedly mixed assemblage of Union army deserters, Confederate sympathizers, Copperhead Democrats, and outlaws began to target unconditional Unionists, men who had stuck with Lincoln through the Emancipation Proclamation and the recruitment of Kentucky African Americans into the local military. Their goal was to maintain white supremacy. Like guerrillas elsewhere, they might join Confederate raiders like John Hunt Morgan, but concentrated mostly on terrorizing and assassinating local enemies. Highly mobile, they were so effective that Kentucky's Unionists demanded that Lincoln withdraw the amnesty, and Stephen Burbridge, Union military commander in Kentucky, took increasingly Draconian measures against them. Both to no avail; postwar Kentucky was more Confederate in sentiment than the state had been during the war, as irregulars continued their campaign as ""regulators.""</p>  <p>Notorious Tinker Dave Beaty's Unionist guerrillas contested Fentress County, in Tennessee's Upper Cumberland Valley, with even more notorious Champ Ferguson's Confederates. Aron Astor's study of Beaty's men uses social network theory and the General Provost Records to find out just who they were. Historians have claimed that Confederate guerrillas tended to be sons of slaveholders in commercial farming districts, while their Unionist enemies were likely to be isolated in mountain districts farther from the rivers and roads necessary for commerce. And to a degree this works for Fentress County. But there were very obvious exceptions -- prosperous slaveholding Unionists. By looking at the social connections of Beaty's men, Astor finds that though some were indeed neighbors of Unionists in the isolated coves, and many joined in reaction against Ferguson, nearly all were related to each other or to Beaty's kin. Astor stresses that guerrillas operated by knowing their networks: whom they could trust, whom they should follow, who their enemies were, and where they could find refuge and get supplies.  Social network theory investigates the bonds that hold individuals together, and therefore can illuminate how and why and where Beaty's men were recruited, and how they could survive as a minority in extremely hostile circumstances.</p> 	<p>Scott Thompson looks at the irregular war in Loudon County, Virginia, on the contested border adjacent to Maryland and (West) Virginia. Loudon supported Union and Confederate companies, both mostly drawn from young farmers and laborers and both committed ideologically to the war and to protecting neighbors and kin. The Confederate ""Comanches"" defended the right of secession, supported slavery, believed in states' rights, and understood Republicans as abolitionists with monarchical tendencies. They embraced the ideal of independent partisan rangers, but were organized as part of the 35th Virginia Cavalry Battalion. The Unionist Loudon Rangers, organized by the Union army but also wishing to operate independently, believed in an indivisible Union; with some Quaker antecedents, they were antislavery and embraced free labor values. In both armies, control of the border took precedence over local concerns, so each side sent regulars to intervene in Loudon's irregular war, and neither company had the autonomy it wanted. They waged a partisan local civil war that the Confederate majority dominated, but they also fought in the Antietam campaign, and served alongside conventional soldiers in defense of the border. Rangers and Comanches alike resisted being sent far away from their homes -- the Rangers more successfully, while the more ideologically committed Comanches marched away. However, they left behind a group under John Mobberley who refused to leave Loudon, and who soon won a reputation as brutal guerrillas. Eliminating Mobberley's gang would be the main accomplishment of the Loudon Rangers.</p>	<p>Lisa Franks argues that Federals fought a war on women in which regular soldiers from Sheridan's and Sherman's armies acted as guerrillas, targeting and terrorizing the plantation mistresses they believed to have been at the heart of the Confederate war. Threatening and mocking, destroying not just food supplies but also women's personal possessions and family souvenirs, by irregular tactics regular soldiers sought to break down Southern resistance. Franks believes that male scholars' gendered readings of the Union troops' behavior tend to ignore female voices and values, and consequently emphasize physical while largely ignoring psychological damage, sanitizing the ""Hard War"" against civilians.</p> 	<p>Matthew M. Stith concludes that the difficult terrain and varied built environments of the trans-Mississippi perpetuated the brutal guerrilla war there. While Union counter-irregular forces tried to learn the environment, they usually failed to match their enemies' knowledge and supporting civilian networks. They then turned against the built environment -- home, barn, fields, pigpens -- that sustained both groups. Civilian families' success in defending their animals and corn determined whether they would live out the war at home or as refugees. As farmers' carefully improved natural environment reverted to wilderness, commercial agriculture returned to subsistence for survival.</p>	<p>Laura June Davis expands the definition of irregular war by investigating how St. Louis--based boat burners, financed and overseen by the Confederate War Department, impeded the passage of Union troops and supplies down the lower Mississippi after Vicksburg. Self-constituted groups of experienced steamboat men, gathering information from bars and brothels, planted incendiary devices in a hard guerrilla war against boats and passengers, public and private. Protected by their social networks, they were able to thwart Federal spies, gunboat patrols, and local lawmen impressed into Union service. As with all successful guerrillas, the damage they did was compounded by fear and the need to divert troops against them.</p> 	<p>Joseph M. Beilein, Jr. makes heavy drinking central to the Missouri guerrilla conflict. He uses social research to debunk the idea that drunkenness was simply an excuse for violent behavior; rather, drinking was a part of guerrilla culture. The ability to hold your liquor was a measure of manhood, drinking together made comrades, and alcohol might ease the hardships of living in the brush and even remove inhibitions against murder. Drinking did not cause massacres like Centralia; by that time ""no quarter"" was a fact of guerrilla life and mutilation a tool of terror. But whiskey did make it possible for guerrillas to endure the escalating violence of the bitter, bloody war in Missouri.</p>	<p>Matthew C. Hurlbert compares four stories about the murder and mutilation of Larkin M. Skaggs, one of Quantrill's marauders who was captured by the people of Lawrence. By looking at the individual stories before they coalesced into a single narrative of guerrilla brutality and civilian innocence, Hurlbert can understand how individual families experienced the attack. To protect Lawrence's self-image of innocence, nonwhites were depicted as the grisly avengers. Both for the guerrillas, who had split into small bands staging a series of home invasions, and for the victims, Quantrill's raid devolved into something very like the household guerrilla war that plagued rural Kansas and Missouri. Individual households were both the necessary centers of supply and information for the guerrillas and, in turn, the targets of guerrilla hunters.</p>     	<p>Anthony Fialka's spatial analysis of the Missouri Confederate guerrillas' domestic supply line rests on three digitized sources: the available primary and secondary sources on Missouri's guerrilla war; the Missouri Provost Marshals' papers, for guerrilla movements, the actions of their supporters and abettors, and the reaction of Unionists; and a digitized version of Frederick Dyer's <i>Compendium of the War of the Rebellion</i>, for the spatial location of the Union army's movements. Union general Thomas Ewing, Jr., commander on the Missouri-Kansas border, made war on the guerrillas' terms by making war at the household level. Civilians were jailed, banished, and assaulted; ultimately he depopulated the counties at the heart of this irregular war zone. Fialka's analysis finds Ewing's strategy successful: the only way to end household war was to end households. The nexus of guerrilla activity, rebel households, and Union army retaliation then shifted to the east, to the state's wealthiest counties along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers, where guerrillas fought to protect their futures as slaveholders, while Union counter-irregular efforts focused, again, on households, targeting noncombatants.</p> 	<p>Andrew F. Lang tackles the effects of unrestrained guerrilla warfare on Union soldiers.  Fighting a war with no rules could not help but brutalize all participants.   Michael Fellman has argued that this mode of war broke down all social conventions; Lang demonstrates that Lieber's
rules, which urged restraint but allowed wide latitude to soldiers in the field, reflected official concern about this breakdown but could not control revenge for murdered comrades and preemptive strikes against suspected guerrilla households. Federals lost all respect for their foes, increasingly seeing them as savages in a savage landscape, inferiors culturally and even racially -- like Indians or Mexicans. Their conception of themselves as citizen-soldiers fatally undermined, they became themselves guerrillas.</p> 	<p>Earl J. Hess's work runs counter to the rest of the essays in this collection in that he places guerrilla struggles in a global comparative perspective and takes a purely military point of view. Debunking the salience of the famed Spanish guerrilla war against Napoleon, he further denies that guerrillas had a decisive impact on the American Civil War. Against Lincoln's and Davis's combined total of 1,400, 000 men under arms, the 50,000 or so guerrillas seem relatively unimportant; only lower level officers and few Federal troops were assigned to control guerrillas, who never inflicted a strategic defeat on them; and the suffering caused by irregulars and counter-guerrilla units outweighed any military benefits they might have generated. Finally, he agrees with Jefferson Davis that continuing the war after Appomattox would have had no hope of success, while exponentially increasing civilian suffering: there are no international examples of a people winning by irregular war <i>after</i> losing a conventional war.</p> 	<p>In a metahistorical Afterword, Daniel Sutherland offers a semi-autobiographical account of how he came to believe that the guerrilla war was decisive. Starting by looking at the conflict in Arkansas, he found that for most civilians and soldiers the guerrilla war was how they experienced the war. Learning that Michael Fellman had discovered the same for Missouri, Sutherland soon became impressed at how similar was the guerrilla war waged in very different sections of the South. In <i>A Savage Conflict</i> he argued that the guerrilla war, uncontrollable, ravaging friend and foe alike and ultimately bringing down Federal retaliation, undermined confidence in the Confederate government and destroyed many Southerners' willingness to fight, and thus played a decisive role in Confederate defeat. Here, appealing to the ""new military history"" <i>contra</i> Hess, he reiterates that only those historians who ignore social consequences can deny the decisive impact of the guerrilla war. He suggests that much research needs to be done to extend the contributions made in this book. Kentucky and Missouri were borderland Union states; was the war waged and remembered differently in the Deep South? How did the irregular war damage slavery? And how did the guerrilla experience shape Southern response to Reconstruction--were guerrillas involved in the Ku Klux Klan violence? Finally, he wants to integrate guerrillas into the larger framework of Civil War studies, along with the conventional war, diplomacy, and politics that usually dominate how we understand the era.</p>	<p>These essays raise other valuable questions. Sutherland asks who the guerrillas were, and while there is solid research identifying them as small slaveholders and their sons, many do not fit this description. Quantrill was an Ohio schoolteacher, Kit Dalton a backwoods farmer, Sam Hildebrand and Bloody Bill Anderson from plain folk farm families with reputations for livestock theft. John McCorkle also called himself a farm boy. George Todd was a bridge mason.  The idea that the ""Lost Cause"" narrative stifled the memory of guerrilla war is an intriguing one -- but the irregular war was also conveniently forgotten in locales, like West Virginia and Appalachian Pennsylvania, where the ""Lost Cause"" view never dominated. These are only two examples of the many questions raised by an excellent collection like this one.</p>  <p><i>Ralph Mann is semi-retired from the University of Colorado, Boulder, and continues to work on Appalachian society and the Civil War.</i></p>"	Mann, Ralph	Fall 2017	2017-11-1	Review			LSU Press		Military			"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=241 alt=\""Product Cover\"" border=0 src=\""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/mcknightguerrilla.jpg\"">"							
6615	9781469634197	$37.50	The Battle of Peach Tree Creek: Hood\'s First Effort to Save Atlanta		Hess, Earl J.			" Foreshadowing the Fall: A Prelude<p>On July 20, 1864, Union and Confederate forces clashed on the northern outskirts of Atlanta in the first of several major battles for the city. At Peach Tree Creek General John Bell Hood, the newly appointed as Commander of the Confederate Army of Tennessee, launched an attack against the right wing of the Union Army of the Cumberland under General George H. Thomas.  The stakes were high. As Earl J. Hess points out in his new book on the engagement, ""To be driven back to the north side [of Peach Tree Creek] would be rightfully seen as a major military defeat with potentially dire consequences for the Northern war effort as a whole."" (6) Hess's meticulous research -- over fifty archives are listed in the bibliography -- reveals some interesting details. Peach Tree Creek, contrary to its name, may not have harbored any fruit trees at all.  The name may very well be a corruption of a pine tree that was known to Native American for producing ""a good deal of pitch,"" which became corrupted to ""peach.""  The creek on that hot July afternoon amounted to ""a relatively small stream, fifteen to twenty feed wide but it had steep banks and a sandy bottom."" (39)</p>  <p>Hood planned to hit the Federals after they had crossed creek thereby pinning the bluecoats against the natural water obstacle.  In one spot, an entire Confederate division assaulted a lone Union division.  Yet such was the state of Confederate field leadership that its corps and division commanders did not press their numerical advantage to exploit the one-and-a-mile gap in the Union line. As Hess made clear, the battle at Peach Tree Creek had its share of drama and bloodletting, but the Confederates failed to capitalize on their tactical advantages.  Union fortitude, doggedness, and not the least, sufficient numbers, meant that the defenders held the field when night came.  What Hood and Jefferson Davis hoped for was a dramatic turnaround that would bring to a halt William T. Sherman's march through the heart of the Confederacy.  The outcome proved disappointing to the Confederate leadership, and Sherman's forces retained the offensive initiative at nightfall.</p><p>In their victory the Federals lost 1900 out of some 20,000 bluecoats engaged; the retreating rebels suffered 2500 casualties out of the 26,000 men they sent into battle on that hot, muggy day. The battle can be seen as microcosm of the war itself; initial success by the South ultimately became undone before the unbreakable will, steady leadership, and superior manpower of the North.</p>   <p>Six weeks and several battles later, Hood had no choice but to abandon Atlanta to Sherman.  The fall of Atlanta on September 2, 1864 unquestionably stiffened the Northern public's will to prosecute the war and helped ensure Lincoln's reelection victory in November.  Hood retained command of the Army of Tennessee.  His belief in aggressive attack would lead him to wreck his army in the disastrous battles of Franklin and Nashville several months later.  By the end of 1864, the Confederate army in the Western theatre had effectively ceased to exist.</p><p>Hess offers a critical assessment of the role that leadership and morale played in the outcome of the battle, and indeed, the entire Western theatre.  The Confederate army in the West did not solve its longstanding problem with leadership at the top. Disputes, rivalries, and intrigue within the high command proved a persistent problem that ultimately left rebel forces demoralized and debilitated. Hess stakes his ground by criticizing Davis and the leadership vacuum within the Confederate Western army. Writes Hess, ""Davis' choices were limited more by his own mind than by the supply of capable officers available.  If the Confederate government could not muster a suitable general to command its major army in the West other than by choosing someone [Hood] whose first reaction was to cancel the promotion and who felt so overwhelmed that he could barely cope with it, then something was seriously wrong with the entire Confederate army.  There is no comparable story to be found in the history of the Union war effort."" (38)</p>  <p>Hess has few kind words to say of both Confederate generals of the Army of Tennessee.  Of Joseph E. Johnston, Hess writes, ""The corporate spirit of the Army of Tennessee had declined from its willingness to engage in fierce offensive tactics in previous battles to a decidedly defensive mind-set under Johnston's questionable tutelage."" (235) Hess has equally sharp words for Johnston's replacement: ""Hood was probably the worst choice Davis and [General Braxton] Bragg could have made. Other than an aggressive, confident spirit, Hood held no other qualifications for such an important position."" (236) As much as Peach Tree Creek signaled the decline of the morale in the Confederate rank and file, ""the Federal armies opposing Hood were filled with men accustomed to winning on the battlefield."" (234)</p><p>Hess divides the battlefield, and his book, into sections so as to allow the reader to understand both the particulars of each engagement and how the parts added up to a greater sum.  Certain details provided by the author are worth noting. An Indianan brigade commander, Benjamin Harrison, saw heavy action that July day and would later rise to commander-in-chief as the 23rd president.  Hood at Atlanta faced his old West point classmates, John M. Schofield, and James B. McPherson, both now Union generals. ""Sherman [Class of 1840] took comfort in noting that Hood graduated forty-fourth in the class of 1853, whereas Schofield had graduated seventh and McPherson first."" (31) McPherson fell in battle two days after Peach Tree; both his classmates would survive the war.  Hess fills his book with not just the thoughts and intentions of officers and the opinions and observations of lowly grunts.  Hood put his best spin on the battle in his evening report to Richmond: ""[Our] corps drove the enemy into his breastworks, but did not gain possession of them."" (189) In contrast, Hamlin Coe of the 29th Michigan wrote of more immediate concerns in his diary post-battle: ""I never suffered so from heat before.  My clothes were as wet as though I had been in water."" (183)</p>	<p>Hess effectively walks the reader through the strategic maneuvering and geographic dispositions of the two opposing armies that preceded the battle. Hess devotes no less than the last fifth of the book to discussing both the immediate aftermath of the battle and the subsequent unfolding of events that led to Atlanta's fall to Sherman six weeks after the veteran bluecoats stood their ground south of Peach Tree Creek.  Quite vivid is Hess's description of burying the bodies left on the field and the pitiful sufferings of wounded.  In sum, Hess offers both small details (the nature of the terrain, the heat and humidity that sapped the men's strength as the battle raged, the blackberries ripening on the bushes by the Creek, the tears in the eyes of Union General John W. Geary as he looked upon the dead body of his aide at battle's end) and the larger picture (the role of the Atlanta campaign within the larger strategic questions facing Richmond and Washington, the debilitating intrigue and squabbling within the Confederate high command).</p>  <p>In a way, leading the armies into battle at Peach Tree Creek is a lot like writing a book about the battle.  Writes Hess in his assessment of Hood's fatal shortcomings as army commander, ""To a significant degree, commanding a field army demanded a certain degree of abstract thinking""and a habit of thorough study of a myriad of topics associated with logistics, geography, politics, and morale."" (237-238) Where Hood fell short in his craft, Hess got it right in his account of the Battle of Peach Tree Creek.</p> <p><i>L.

6577	881466050	$35.00	Jefferson Davis's Final Campaign: Confederate Nationalism and the Fight to Arm Slaves		Dillard, Philip D.			" Re-Evaluating Confederate Emancipation	<p>Phillip Dillard attempts to provide a deeper examination of the Confederate debate to arm slaves than historians have done before. First seriously mooted by Irish immigrant General Pat Cleburne, after the debacle of the Confederate loss at Chattanooga in late 1863, realistic proposals only came to the fore in late 1864 as General Robert E. Lee confronted President Jefferson Davis with the reality of severe manpower shortages in the Army of Northern Virginia. Davis, who had ordered all discussion of Cleburne's proposal halted less than a year before, was now more sympathetic to the concept. In his message to Congress in late 1864, Davis called for an examination of the potential recruitment of slaves into the Confederate army in return for some measure of their freedom. Davis's allies worked in Congress to make this plan so, but it took until early March 1865 before the Confederate Congress passed an act for the recruitment of such slaves in the Confederate army. Only small numbers were recruited though, many of whom deserted, which meant that it was much too bitty and much too late to have any effect on the outcome of the War. As a result, Dillard believes, other scholars, who have studied Confederate emancipation, dismiss the radical elements of it, believing that Davis ""cynically promoted"" it only as a desperate last measure to save the Confederacy (p.4). He disagrees and believes that the offer was real and truly revolutionary in nature especially as he promises to concentrate his argument of the attitudes of ""common southerners"" (p.5) rather than elites.</p>	<p>Dillard's effort centres on Confederate newspaper opinion from late 1864 through the end of the war. He focuses on three states, Virginia, for the eastern theater, Georgia, for the 1864 western theater, and Texas for the relatively peaceful Trans-Mississippi West. What he finds is that there were substantial differences between these states, as well as some change over time. In Virginia, Dillard sees the greatest support for the arming of slaves and also in emancipation for any who did serve. There were opponents, but these were usually papers already critical of the Davis administration's general war effort. John Daniel's <i>Richmond Examiner</i>, for example, an implacable opponent of Davis, was, unsurprisingly, an opponent of the policy, even to the point of being heavily critical of the vaunted Robert E. Lee's support of it.</p>	<p>Georgia's newspapers, even though the state had seen the fall of Atlanta and Sherman's march to the sea, were more evenly split and also showed the most change over time. Regional differences within the state explained some of the division. Athens, for example, the seat of the University of Georgia, in the eastern part of the state, showed no support, the city being relatively untouched directly by the war. In the central part of the state, however, which had suffered the sting of defeat at the hands of Sherman, ""the bold comments that appeared in the <i>Macon Telegraph and Confederate</i> [calling for the enlistment of slaves] . . . show that many Central Georgians would not follow the head-in-the-sand approach"" of opponents but instead ""heard the howls of necessity and explored radical solutions to the [Confederate] manpower problem"" (p.136). Even some initial critics came around to its necessity as the situation became even worse for the Confederacy in the Spring of '65.</p>	<p>Texas indicated the least support for slave enlistment. Far away from the disasters on the battlefields to the east, most Texas editors and correspondents felt that the need for more troops could be met by more efficient conscription of the white population. They were also the most vociferous against any discussion of emancipation as a reward for slave service. Anyone suggesting such an idea was widely condemned. Judge John T. Mills, Irish-born immigrant and planter, for example, wrote to a Galveston newspaper in January 1865 calling for enlistment and emancipation as the only options were ""submission and reunion or emancipation and continuing the struggle"" (p.157). Mills, even though he had been an ardent secessionist in 1861, received such opposition that just six weeks later he ""broke and recanted"" (p.247). Writing another public letter, he stated that he had never ""'doubted our ability to maintain our independence without humiliating concessions to Yankeedom, or any of the rest of mankind, on the subject of slavery or any other'"" (p. 247). In Texas it seemed that the slavery system continued virtually unmolested as the state continued to produce cotton (for very lucrative sale across the border in Mexico).</p> <p>Dillard rightly makes these state differences a major element of his study. Where the slavery system could still run efficiently, it did. But, even in Virginia where the need was most desperate, there were still many opposed beyond some disgruntled publishers. Its two Confederate senators were opposed voting against the measure as late as February, and only changed their minds when the Virginia legislature (meeting in the same building in Richmond) threatened to replace them. The final passage was a close run thing in the Senate too, and thus the act did not enshrine emancipation as a reward for enlistment. Slavery was to be maintained even at this late hour. Dillard wants to concentrate on the ""common southerners"" opinions but ultimately it was the elite's views that really mattered. Only military desperation got anything passed at all.</p><p>Ultimately, it's difficult to tell how much the newspaper editorials and/or letters truly represented the views of these common southerners. Too often Dillard sees support for emancipation in the papers as representing the will of the many. For example, the <i>Augusta Constitutionalist</i> was a major supporter of Confederate emancipation and published numerous letters in favor of it. Dillard takes this as a sign that the ""vast majority"" of Augustans ""discovered that slavery could be sacrificed much more easily than southern independence"" (p.220). His evidence from the <i>Constitutionalist</i> does not justify that conclusion (along with the fact that the other paper, the <i>Augusta Chronicle</i>, which, to be fair, he covers, was a vociferous opponent). This overstatement is a pity as just highlighting the extent of the debate in these three states is a valuable contribution to our understanding of the issue. Dillard shows that it's too easy to dismiss it as a cynical ploy because it did prompt serious thinking and debate across the country about what the Confederacy stood for as it faced defeat. Engaging more with the historiography though would have added more nuance here and Dillard does not do enough of that. Paul Quigley's work on southern nationalism, for example, sees ""sacrifice"" as the last defining characteristic of Confederate nationalism left at the end of the war. Perhaps the move to use slaves then had more to do with that example than any serious rethinking of what southern independence really meant or any real radical change in Confederate ideology on the centrality of slavery to its cause?</p>  <p><i>David T.

Known as the Anaconda Plan, the initial Union strategy to win the war called for a Union blockade of the southern coast and for Union control of the Mississippi River.  In addition to seizing New Orleans, Union forces would advance down the Mississippi from St. Louis, capture Confederate strongholds and convert them into Union bases.  Control of the Mississippi would allow goods, military material and men to flow freely along the river while cutting the Confederacy in two.</p>  	<p>In <i>The Civil War on the Mississippi:  Union Sailors, Gunboat Captains, and the Campaign to Control the River</i>, historian Barbara Brooks Tomblin has added a new level of factual detail to this familiar historical ground.   This monograph focuses primarily on the Navy's efforts from the summer of 1861 to just after the fall of Vicksburg in the summer of 1863. The narrative is organized chronologically and details the Navy's role in numerous minor engagements and skirmishes in addition to well-known battles such as Ft. Henry, Ft. Donelson, Island No. 10, Memphis and Vicksburg.   In her narrative, Tomblin introduces the major naval officers in the campaign, summarizes their respective activities, and explains how they cooperated with their army counterparts to win control of the Mississippi.</p>  	<p>Tomblin also describes the creation of the Union's new brown water Navy.   When the war began in 1861, the United States did not have a naval force on the Mississippi or Ohio Rivers.  Since existing deep-draft, ocean-going warships were not useful on much of the Mississippi, the Navy Department scrambled to create an effective river force by building or purchasing and converting shallow draft vessels.  The result was the Western Gunboat Flotilla which consisted of three converted commercial side-wheel steamers known as timberclads because they were fortified by timber bulwarks.  The Navy also built seven city class small ironclads known as ""Pook Turtles,"" several large ironclads, a number of small ironclads dubbed as tinclads and various other vessels including mortar bearing barges.   Collectively these vessels furnished a functional and effective force which was renamed the Mississippi Squadron in 1862.</p> 	<p>Finding recruits to fully man these ships was a major challenge since service in the brown water Navy was neither attractive nor glamorous.  In addition to the threat of death or injury, Union forces suffered from disease and fevers as well as monotony and boredom.  Since recruitment of American volunteers was always difficult, the Navy turned to foreigners, free African Americans, fugitive slaves and even some Confederate prisoners of war.   Fugitive (or contraband) slaves were accepted into Union naval service beginning in the spring of 1862, but their service was not warmly welcomed.  Confronting the typical racial prejudice of the day, both free and contraband African Americans nevertheless made a significant contribution to Union success on the Mississippi.</p>  <p>On the Mississippi, Union forces faced various challenges including Confederate steam powered rams, gunboats and torpedoes (or mines) as well as gunfire from enemy forces on shore and a hostile population in some towns along the river.   Union forces fought several engagements with Confederate vessels in addition to bombarding and exchanging fire with Confederate fortifications and gun batteries on numerous occasions.  The river itself was also a powerful force of nature which produced dangerous hazards.  Spring and winter rains brought flooding while warm weather produced low water.</p>  	<p>The most important contribution of this study is Tomblin's research which includes some new primary sources from common sailors, junior officers, reporters and local observers living along the river.  These personal diaries, memoirs, letters and newspaper accounts collectively furnish a fresh view of everyday life in the brown water Navy.  The reader gets firsthand accounts of everyday occurrences, combat experiences and candid judgments on commanding officers. These letters and journal entries include first-hand descriptions of foraging parties on shore, shoveling snow from an ironclad's deck, the amputation of a crewman's arm, and the capture of a whiskey supply from an enemy vessel.  They also include candid observations about the civilians living along the river, relationships with African Americans, and personal views of the river war.</p> 	<p><i>The Civil War on the Mississippi</i> is a well written, logically organized and clear account of the naval war on the Mississippi.  Its coverage is thorough, and its research is impressive.  As such, it is likely to stand as the standard history of this important subject.  While most of its operations were not glamorous or well celebrated by history, the achievements of the Union's brown water Navy were critical to victory in the west.  In the judgment of Admiral David Dixon Porter, the ""services of the Navy in the West had as much effect in reducing the south to submission as the greater battles fought in the East.""

6391	9781469627342	$28.00	The Virgin Vote: How Young Americans Made Democracy Social, Politics Personal, and Voting Popular in the Nineteenth Century		Grinspan, Jon			"'The Thrill is Gone: ' The Virgin Vote and American Political Culture	<p>During the heated presidential primary leading up to the 2016 election young voters under thirty turned out in droves to support the unconventional seventy-five year old Vermont Senator, Bernie Sanders, handing him more primary votes than they did to the two eventual major party nominees combined.  In assessing Sanders' appeal pundits and scholars alike pointed to his plain speak message that the American nation had fallen under the control of a self-serving moneyed elite whose policies hindered opportunity and threatened the American credo of democratic equality.  Young voters seemingly found a voice and call to action in Sanders' Populist crusade.  Their strong support did not, however, translate into unwavering backing of the party that Sanders sought to lead.  On the contrary, once their candidate lost the Democratic Party's presidential nomination, enough of these young voters either stayed home on election day, cast their ballots for third party candidates whose views more closely aligned with their own, or threw their support behind the anti-establishment populism of Republican Donald Trump to ensure a Democratic defeat. </p> <p>Jon Grinspan's pithy and thought-provoking work, <i>The Virgin Vote</i>, offers us a powerful portrayal of a time in our nation's history where such limited partisan fealty was unimaginable and suggests that today's parties might learn lessons about cultivating party loyalty by closely examining nineteenth century political culture. </p> <p>Focusing his gaze on the period 1840-1900, Grinspan deftly describes the central role of young Americans in driving the tumultuous politics of the nineteenth century.  While some of this influence can be ascribed to demographics -- America was a nation of young people with its median age hovering close to 18 throughout much of this era -- Grinspan rightly connects this phenomenon to the social and cultural upheaval that swirled through nineteenth century American life.  In a striking parallel to the plight of today's young voters, America's nineteenth century youth, grappling with the everyday pressures of maturation, also confronted a tsunami of sweeping change (the market revolution and the second great awakening, the physical expansion of the nation and dispersal of the population, rapid technological change, civil war and reconstruction, the influx of millions of foreign born immigrants, industrialization and labor strife, the erosion of rural life, and urbanization, to name but a few) that left them uncertain about their futures and about how best to create stability in their own lives.  As traditional life gave way in the face of these forces, the nation's voters steered the nation's political culture into a pronounced democratic turn (eliminating property requirements for voting and establishing 21 as the age of majority) as the electorate looked to the political system to help them navigate uncertain times and to restore the nation to stability.  ""Grasping for maturity in the shaken nineteenth century,"" Grinspan writes, young men and women used the extroverted world of politics as a convenient handhold."" (55) </p><p>This combination of forces proved a potent brew and the nation's youth (most especially, of course, its white males) eagerly embraced the new political order (and vice versa), ""trading their energy, and eventually their votes, for identity and importance.""(5) The result, the reader is reminded was a raucous political culture characterized by pole raisings, hard cider, barbeques, torch lit parades, log cabins, polling place brawls, and extremely high voter turnout.  Importantly, Grinspan argues, while some of these youthful voters sought to shape policy, far more important to them was how the political process could be used to help them achieve personal goals (asserting their manhood, impressing members of the opposite sex, exerting women's voices in a highly patriarchal culture, ingratiating oneself with party leaders in the hope of gaining employment or influence, etc.).  Stepping eagerly forward to cast their ""virgin votes"" and to declare their partisan fealty was not, Grinspan argues, a matter taken lightly.  On the contrary, years of political acculturation in combination with personal goals (most readily achieved through long term commitments) and the active solicitation of party leadership who recognized the vital importance of capturing virgin voters and cementing their partisan identities, ensured that the votes of America's nineteenth century youth remained steadfast for a lifetime. </p><p>While offering a sensitive and illuminating overview of the vital role of young voters in America's nascent political party system Grinspan's work does have its limitations, especially in its accounting of the Civil War/Reconstruction years.  Missing, for instance, is a thorough consideration of the role of ideology in shaping political affiliation.  As Harry Watson, J. Mills Thornton, Michael Morrison, and a host of other historians have shown, fundamental and deeply held convictions about the nature of American freedom and its threatened demise played central roles in inspiring political and personal action.  Indeed, one cannot explain the century's pivotal event (the Civil War) absent ideologically driven politics.  In this sense, Grinspan's general disregard for third party movements and/or partisan realignment (he frequently attributes such movements to an ""in"" versus ""out"" dichotomy), particularly in the antebellum era, and his privileging of personal aspirations over interest in policy, falls especially short in helping the reader to understand why a young Democrat or Whig might, in 1854, suddenly shift his allegiance to the upstart Know Nothing or Republican movements.  More puzzling still is the short shrift given to exploring how young America's most defining experience -- the Civil War -- shaped political identity and partisan behavior.  One would be hard pressed to pinpoint a moment in time of greater consequence (and one where personal ambition would seemingly play less of a role) for more virgin voters than their casting of votes while serving in the armies of the north and south and yet this experience remains mostly absent from Grinspan's work. </p><p>Another gap in Grinspan's narrative thread is the political infancy of African-American voters in the aftermath of the war.  To his credit, the author does a wonderful job of integrating the experience of young women into his account of nineteenth century political life (indeed, this is one of the work's most important contributions).  Virtually nothing, however, is said about newly enfranchised African-Americans and the era's politics.  Did they view political action in the same way as their white peers?  Did politicians (white and black) look to bind these ""virgin voters"" (a great many of whom were well beyond the twenty-one age of majority) through similar raucous, hands on, participatory means to party?  Did African-American voters, when possible, turn out at the same rate as their white peers?  In those places where their voting rights were preserved, did electoral turnout diminish as precipitously as it did among the nation's white youth? Obviously, for many African-Americans, political identity died stillborn in the face of Jim Crow, nonetheless, this segment of the nineteenth century electorate is deserving of much greater attention in this account. </p><p>More persuasive is Grinspan's account of the demise of youth-driven politics in the United States in the waning years of the nineteenth century.  Beginning in 1888 youthful voters began to lose their zeal for politics and the number of virgin votes plummeted by fifty percent over the next thirty-six years.  Two primary factors, Grinspan argues, led to this precipitous decline.  First, the nation's moneyed elite, always uncomfortable with the messiness of a democracy often dominated by working class politicians and eager to order the United States into a well-defined and rational nation, steered young voters away from the streets and into the more restrained and structured world of ""good government"" and in so doing killed the excitement and spontaneity that had made earlier politics so appealing to young voters.  Likewise, the simultaneous emergence of ""a vital youth culture"" provided young Americans with alternative forms of entertainment and a new, more confident identity, thus leading young voters ""to value relating to their generation above struggling for maturity.""(132)  The net effect of this disentangling of youth culture and political culture, Grinspan contends, was a political alienation of American youth that has continued down to our present time, in spite of a broadening of the electorate via the 26th Amendment.  Sadly, <i>The Virgin Vote</i> warns us, upticks in youth voting, such as the one supporting Bernie Sanders in the recent presidential primary, are nothing more than fleeting glimpses of what could be and that efforts to build consistent voter turnout and affinity among the nation's young voters are bound to fail without the successful reunification of the personal need for politics and a consistent and sustained exposure to democratic political life. </p><p><i>Martin Hershock is Dean of the College of Arts, Sciences, and Letters and Professor of History at the University of Michigan-Dearborn.

6581			Look at Lincoln:  Grant Restored					"<b>Grant</b> By Chernow, Ron <b>Publisher:</b>Penguin Press  <b>Retail Price:</b> $40.00 <b>ISBN:159420487X</b> </p>    Grant Restored <p>When both academicians and the general public ache for leaders with a genuine path forward, this book appears at an apt time.  Grant, as Ron Chernow beautifully narrates, is a kind of anti-hero who evolved by taking advantage of ""the right to rise"" -- demonstrating that ordinary people sometimes perform extraordinarily.</p>  <p>Chernow's volume, along with other recent biographies by Jean Edward Smith and Ronald White, Jr., go a long way in restoring Ulysses S. Grant's luster and reputation.  Ironically, until Grant's death in 1885, he was more popular than his Commander-in-Chief, Abraham Lincoln, yet his reputation and legacy precipitately then fell for decades.  Fortunately, these three biographies now restore the man and leader.  For example, the C-SPAN survey of presidents earlier this year place Grant in the number 22 position (the middle of the pack) up from 33 in the 2000 poll.</p>   <p>In an effort at full disclosure, I was honored to have read the manuscript even before it became page proofs and came away with renewed appreciation for Grant's character and leadership, not to mention his unique personal and political skills used to command armies and lead our nation during the difficult years of Reconstruction.</p>   <p>The author makes Grant relevant in a time when partisanship is rampant and denigrated.  But this volume and Charles Calhoun's new book on the Grant presidency, demonstrate that political ruthlessness can be used to advance America's highest ideals.</p> <p>Chernow clearly shows that Grant was in sync with Lincoln, especially in insuring freedom for all.   President Grant sent his Attorney General to the South with instructions for the United States attorneys to bring charges and indict those who were thwarting the Civil War amendments to the Constitution and the Civil Rights Act of 1866 which, in part, the amendments were intended to confirm and ratify.</p> <p>This biography is chock-full of examples that demonstrate Grant's three essential qualities of leadership: courage, resiliency, and empathy.  Winston Churchill said, ""Courage is rightly esteemed "" the first of human qualities "" because it is the quality that guarantees all others.""  Unless Grant had possessed the courage to turn defeat into victory, as in the Battle of Shiloh, it remains uncertain whether the Civil War would have ended when it did with over 750,000 lives -- North and South -- lost.  Nor, would there have been gains in reconciliation and confirmation of rights during Reconstruction if Grant had lacked courage.  He possessed a confidence in his own judgment and an unyielding adherence to his own beliefs.  As Chernow shows, Grant had an obsession with his own character, but in a self-effacing way.  During the Civil War, he relentlessly questioned his duties as a general and, during his presidency, whether he was fulfilling his obligations to all Americans, white or black.</p>   <p>Grant recognized that it was his burden to act even in the face of great uncertainty and opposition, including those who sought his removal from command for binge drinking.  Chernow states that Grant was an alcoholic, something that could be treated medically today, but reviled in Grant's time.  But Grant, according to Chernow, was a functioning alcoholic who virtually shed the affliction by the time he took the presidential oath.</p>   <p>Grant faced thorny questions regarding the status of the freedman after the war.  In addition, the North was riven by racism that ran the gamut from a rabid desire to eliminate freed slaves entirely from the continent to ""merely"" disgust at the idea of blacks and whites having anything like a shared common life in postwar America.</p>   <p>He also possessed the resiliency to see through to the end what he set out to do as General and President.  The author demonstrates this was a quality that Grant possessed his entire life.  It is clear that Grant was a resilient leader who was not deflected from his essential aims by politics, opposition, losses, or interim failure.  He was able to adopt new tactics, regroup and reassess, as well as reevaluate the proper means to an end.  While overly loyal in instances, Grant understood that people were often animated more by venal self-interest than any larger consideration.  For his entire presidency, Grant would govern a country that, in many ways, continued to be ""a house divided.""</p>  <p>It is clear from this biography that Grant also possessed empathy.  President Grant recognized that over 200,000 African Americans had enlisted and their service helped swing the war toward Northern victory.  As Abraham Lincoln said to a friend, ""If they stake their lives for us, they must be promoted by the strongest motive -- even the promise of freedom.  And the promise being made, must be kept.""  Grant agreed with this and did his best to see it through.  The failure of Reconstruction resulted not from Grant's attempts at peace and reconciliation -- the President had to deal with the South's recalcitrance, his military, Congress, the courts, and an entire culture that would take more than a century to change.  Grant recognized a shared humanity between himself and African Americans.  Despite deep cultural differences, they both aspired to fundamentally the same things: earning through one's labor, enjoying the fruits from that labor, controlling one's own life, and believing in ""the right to rise.""  Ulysses S. Grant was an uncommonly good man.</p>   <p>Destined to be a classic biography, the author's details of battles in which General Grant was involved are worthy of inclusion in any military history of the Civil War.  Along with Grant's alcoholism with which he had to cope throughout the war, Chernow's description of this illness is masterful as is his comparison of General Grant and General Lee.  What is intriguing are Chernow's descriptions of every major character involved in Grant's life -- his much loved and loving wife Julia, his braggadocio father Jesse, Abraham Lincoln, Mary Lincoln,  Benjamin Butler, Chief of Staff Henry Halleck, General George P. McClellan, General Ambrose Burnside and Grant's particular friend, General William T. Sherman.  Chernow's insights are right on the mark in nearly every chapter.  This biography confirms again Ron Chernow's masterful talent.</p> <p><i>Frank J. Williams is the founding Chair of the Lincoln Forum, President of The Ulysses S.

6361			Look at Lincoln:  Original Intent: A Candid Look at the Other Thirteenth Amendment		Williams, Frank J.			"<b>Lincoln & The Politics of Slavery: The Other Thirteenth Amendment and the Struggle to Save the Union</b> By Daniel W. Crofts <b>Publisher:</b> University of North Carolina Press <b>Retail Price:</b> $35.00 <b>ISBN: 9781469627311</b> </p>    <p>On March 2, 1861, the thirty-sixth Congress of the United States adopted this join resolution to be sent to the states for ratification:</p> <blockquote> Article XIII.  No amendment shall be made to the Constitution which will authorize or give to Congress the power to abolish or interfere, within any State, with the domestic institutions thereof, including that of persons held to labor or service by the laws of said State. </blockquote>  <p>Although this proposed Thirteenth Amendment was never ratified, four years later another Thirteenth Amendment in contradiction to the original proposed Thirteenth Amendment was adopted by the House and Senate that would end slavery forever. </p>   <p>As this new book points out, the ""original"" Thirteenth Amendment intended to give comfort to slave states so they could remain in the Union.  After all, the election of Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln four months earlier had caused tumult in the South.  Seven slave states from South Carolina to Texas had already seceded and had begun to form a separate government. </p>   <p>President-Elect Lincoln endorsed the original proposed Thirteenth Amendment.  It was never ratified by more than a handful of states because the Civil War, which it was designed to prevent, began in a month and a half. </p> <p>Crofts points out that the prospective amendment of 1861 reminds us that there were no Americans on the eve of the Civil War who expected emancipation.  Even Lincoln thought ""the peculiar institution"" would last until 1900.  Republicans believed they had no authority to emancipate and had no inclination for doing it. </p>   <p>While Lincoln always hated slavery, he also believed that it was legal and constitutionally protected.  He never imagined that he would have to preside over a war to end it. </p>   <p>Crofts discusses the background story, especially the backroom politics, behind the attempt to pass this amendment.  It is fascinating to read a candid portrayal of America's most cherished president.  Crofts is clear in his refusal to accept some historians' view that the evolution of the war's aims from reunion to reunion and emancipation began before Fort Sumter.  While Lincoln did become the ""great emancipator"" it did not begin before he took the oath as the 16th president.  Only from the friction and abrasion of the Civil War did Lincoln evolve and change the war's aims from reunion to reunion and final freedom. </p> <p>Daniel Crofts deserves praise for his detailed research on how Lincoln and other political leaders made every effort to keep the slave states of the Upper South in the Union.  No other book describes the efforts made to pass the ""original"" Thirteenth Amendment.  It is fascinating to see the author's discussion of the view that once the Constitution was adopted in 1787, that an amendment such as this could never be changed.  The author also investigates the ""tension between history as it actually unfolded and history as it is remembered.""  Americans """"tend to read back into history what we'd like to find there"".""</p>   <p>Crofts performs a service in, yet again, warning against judging the past based on current ""values."" </p>  <p><i>Frank J.

6528			Look at Lincoln: More than Poor: Lincoln's Days in Indiana					"<b>Lincoln in Indiana</b> By Dirck, Brian R. <b>Publisher:</b>Southern Illinois University Press <b>Retail Price:</b> $24.95 <b>ISBN:9780809335657</b> </p>    <p>John Lock Scripps, Abraham Lincoln's 1860 presidential campaign biographer, asked Lincoln about his early life.  He responded, ""Why Scripps it is a great piece of folly to attempt to make anything out of my early life.  It can all be condensed into a single sentence"" you will find in Gray's elegy: 'The Short and Simple Annals of The Poor.'""  But Lincoln's comments to Scripps hardly tell the whole story as Brian Dirck's book shows despite the scarcity of reliable sources.</p>     <p>From their arrival to departure for Illinois, Dirck explains the Lincoln family's ancestry and migration from Massachusetts to settling near Pigeon Creek.  Farms were carved out of the wilderness, livelihoods sustained, and family communities formed.</p>   <p>Thomas Lincoln is described in full and reveals his concept of labor and life -- thus, contributing to a strained relationship with his son Abraham who, while an able laborer, could not wait to escape the drudgery of farm work.  Abraham's mother is described in detail up to the time of her death from ""the milk sick.""   Enter Sarah Bush -- the stepmother and the influence she had on her stepson.  Dirck tells us about Abraham's limited education his reading habits, and how he preferred reading over farm work.   In essence, Lincoln developed his own ""right to rise.""</p> <p>Dirck slices through the myths about Lincoln's youth and, at the same time, discusses the social, cultural, and economic issues of early 19th-Century Indiana.  Lincoln wrote a poem, much later in 1846, inspired by the wild he traveled through with his family during that time.  It read: </p> <p>When first my father settled here.</p> <p> ""Twas then the frontier line:</p> <p>The panthers' scream, filled the night with fear</p> <p>And bears preyed on the swine.</p> <p>But wo for Bruin's short lived fun,</p> <p>When rose the squealing cry;</p> <p>Now man and horse, with dog and gun,</p> <p>For vengeance and him fly""</p> <p>Lincoln lived a childhood as a genuine frontiersman.  Lincoln's father acquired property in Indiana where he built a cabin and traveled ninety miles away to make a quarter payment on the land he intended for the family home.   Carl Sandburg wrote that ""they were part of the American Frontier.""  They had moved to Indiana just as it had become a state in 1816, like many others, were moving to the state to find land, live on it, and work it as farmers.</p> <p>From the ages of seven to twenty-one, Lincoln lived in the state of Indiana.  Throughout his childhood he faced much adversity: the death of his mother and sister, cramped quarters in a small log cabin, and the hard life of manual labor.  Yet, it was in Indiana that he also learned the value of education and reading.  After the age of twelve, Lincoln was rarely seen without a book.  Lincoln's stepmother, Sarah Bush Johnston, who had married his father soon after the death of his mother, encouraged Abraham's reading and his education at blab schools -- amounting to one year, which is equivalent to a sixth grade education.</p> <p>His experiences in Indiana later helped shape the way that he viewed policy making as President.  For example, there's clearly a link between the genesis of his policy and the reason for its implementation.  In 1862 he signed into law the land grant college system, legislation for the transcontinental railroad, and the famous Homestead Act.  These legislative accomplishments stem from his fourteen years growing up in the state of Indiana.  This volume presents a vivid portrait of the young Lincoln set within the context of the American frontier.</p>  <p>Because this fine volume is ""concise"" there was no space for exploring the influence Indiana had on President Lincoln. His fourteen years in Indiana taught Lincoln perseverance which was totally essential for his duties as Chief Magistrate. His support of the Morrill Act establishing land-grant colleges, the Homestead Act opening lands for settlement, creation of the Department of Agriculture and the Pacific Railroad Act guaranteeing a transcontinental railroad can all be said to have its genesis during Lincoln's Indiana years.</p> <p>During this, its bicentennial year, Indianans can be proud of their fellow citizen -- Abraham Lincoln.</p><p><i>Frank J.

6634			Look at Lincoln: Stanton: Demythologized					"<b>Stanton: Lincoln's War Secretary</b> By Stahr, Walter <b>Publisher:</b>Simon & Schuster <b>Retail Price:</b>$35.00 <b>ISBN: 9781476739304 </b> </p>    <p>Biographies of Lincoln's cantankerous but able lawyer who served as his Secretary of War are controversial.  That's what makes Stahr -- himself a lawyer -- a promising choice for the latest biography on Edwin McMasters Stanton.</p> <p>Two years before this in-depth study, William Marvel authored <i>Lincoln's Autocrat</i>.  In contrast, Stahr's book offers a broader context for Stanton's actions during the Civil War with his many faults apparent.  Stanton was an advocate and often a cajoling manipulator.  Initially, Stanton did not like Lincoln, but he became a useful tool as the President's ""no"" man.  When Lincoln did not wish to be bothered or wanted to deny another innumerable request, he sent the seeker to Stanton who would rudely deny requests.</p>   <p>Overall, Stanton proved to be a terrific administrator who helped the North and Lincoln win the war.  He mastered the use of telegraphs and railroads to provide men and material to combat areas.</p>   <p>By the 1850s, Stanton was a self-made lawyer and disputatious advocate in court.  The author addresses legends and apocryphal stories.  While some have attributed anti-slavery credentials to Stanton's career, Stahr notes that Stanton had friends on both sides of the issue and remained loyal to the Democratic Party.  At the end of James Buchanan's presidential term, he appointed Stanton his Attorney General.  Stanton objected strenuously to sending arms to the South before the war commenced and argued against secession.</p>  <p>While Stanton was aggressive in efforts to recruit freed African Americans to the Union army and navy, supporting black suffrage quicker than most, Stahr faults him for disregard of civil liberties.  ""Mars"" as Lincoln called him, authorized an increasing number of military tribunals for civilians (over 4,200) and used powers delegated to him by the president to close disloyal newspapers, as well as arrest journalists and editors.  Yet Stahr puts these acts in the context of horrific losses and disunion.</p>   <p>Stahr quickly exonerates Stanton from involvement in conspiracy to murder Lincoln and leaders in the government that have been espoused since the 1930s by Otto Eisenschiml and most recently repeated by Bill O'Reilly.  Parenthetically, if Mr. O'Reilly had shared his manuscript with many knowledgeable people of the Lincoln assassination, he would have avoided many errors.</p>     <p>Stahr questions the legend surrounding his subject; that he disinterred his late daughter and had her remains in his parlor because there was a rumor that the cemetery would be relocated and disturb her casket; that while he may have been rude, Stahr says he had always been that way; and that he did not terminate Lincoln as local counsel in a patent infringement case that initially was to be tried in Illinois.  Regardless, Lincoln was impressed with Stanton's legal skills.</p>   <p>Stanton always sought a judicial career, especially a seat on the Supreme Court of the United States.  President Ulysses S. Grant, who had an ambivalent relationship with Stanton, finally nominated him to succeed Associate Justice Robert C. Grier who was resigning.  Though the nomination was easily confirmed by the Senate and Stanton signed his acceptance to the confirmation, he died before taking the oath.  It was a sad ending to a controversial yet productive life.</p>  <p><blockquote><i>Frank J. Williams is the founding Chair of the Lincoln Forum, President of The Ulysses S.

6472			Look at Lincoln: Lincoln's Political Reawakening					"<b>Wrestling With His Angel: The Political Life of Abraham Lincoln Vol. II, 1849-1856</b> By Sidney Blumenthal <b>Publisher:</b>Simon & Schuster <b>Retail Price:</b> $35.00 <b>ISBN:1501153781 </b> </p>     <p>Talented journalist and historian (as well as a political advisor) Sidney Blumenthal, has undertaken the challenging task of writing a multi-volume biography of America's greatest president.  <i>Wrestling with his Angel: The Political Life of Abraham Lincoln</i>, his second volume, shows the evolution of Lincoln into one of the most astute and Machiavellian politicians of his era.  It more than matches the breadth and depth of the first volume.  Lincoln returns home to his law practice rather than run for re-election to the House of Representatives.  He finally emerges from political exile after the decrepit and demonizing Kansas-Nebraska Act was passed by Congress.  It abrogated the Missouri Compromise which had kept peace -- albeit fragile -- for over 30 years.  Lincoln is incensed and fired up to battle his longtime political nemesis, Senator Stephen A. Douglas, primarily responsible for the 1854 Act.  In the process, Lincoln sees the demise of the Whig Party and helps found the Republican Party in Illinois.</p>    <p>The author provides the deep and often lurid background of the age in which Lincoln lived, operated, practiced law, raised a family, and became a political genius.  Even more than in the first volume, Blumenthal provides a contextual examination of American politics -- to understand Lincoln's ""presence in the transforming events that would eventually carry him to the presidency and their profound influence upon him.""  This was a significant period of American history with the election of ""old rough and ready"" Zachary Taylor as President who was anti-slavery, the Compromise of 1850, the odious <i>Dred Scott</i> decision and the Kansas-Nebraska Act.  It provoked Lincoln ""from his political slumber.""  The Civil War did not just happen.  We were doomed to have it for many reasons, from the first boatload of slaves in 1619, and especially during the decade prior to the beginning of the war. </p>   <p>Blumenthal provides a stunning description of how Lincoln and his like-minded fellows maneuvered to destroy the anti-immigrant party in Illinois in order to create a new Republican Party.  Lincoln writes the new party's first platform and jumps onto the national stage as the leader of that party as a result of his faceoff with Douglas in the 1858 debates.  The race ended in a pyrrhic victory for Douglas, while Lincoln's performance helped launch him to the presidency. </p>   <p>The author portrays Lincoln in this period (1849-56) searching for a purpose and place in American politics.  One question that Blumenthal attempts to answer is whether Lincoln made himself the moral agent in the 1850s.  Did his use of metaphors like the ""house divided"" in speeches and thoughts from the 1850s suggest more than to ""do no more than oppose the <i>extension</i> of slavery"""" and to preserve the Union? </p> <p>Lincoln saw bad faith with the pro-slavery invasion of Kansas, but knew that Kansas was only part of the sepsis infecting the entire country.  Douglas's Kansas-Nebraska bill was not just unprincipled and amoral, but also the product of coercion, if not bribery.   It was political in the worst sense of the word, but Lincoln believed that it was only through politics that the Act's corrosive effects could be countered.</p>   <p>A fellow Whig lawyer traveling the Eighth Judicial Circuit in Central Illinois with Lincoln recalled a long discussion with Lincoln who believed that slavery at some point in the future would become extinct.  The argument went on for a long time and early in the morning when Dickey woke up he saw Lincoln sitting up in bed.  ""Dickey,"" said Lincoln, ""I tell you this nation cannot exist half slave and half free.""   ""Oh, Lincoln,"" replied Dickey, ""go to sleep.""</p>   <p>This soon to be four-volume biography of Lincoln is the most readable to date and promises to be a modern classic in understanding Lincoln's life. </p><p><i>Frank J.

6568	9781606353288	$29.95	Reflections of a Civil War Medical Cadet, Burt Green Wilder		Wilder, Burt Green	(ed.) Reid, Richard M		"<blockquote>""February 5  About one o'clock Dr. Marsh came to say that in ward 5 Dr. Hartsuff was to amputate the leg of a man who had be shot in the knee;  the joint is shattered and discharges profusely.;  he is so weak that he will die unless relieved of the drain.  All the surgeons and cadets were present. For some reason it was decided to use the tourniquet and I was asked to control the femoral artery in the groin with my thumb.  Fortunately my nerves were steady, for it -- after the chief cut around the limb was made -- my thumb had slipped or I had felt faint, the man might have died before the artery could be secured.  All was over at 2[pm] and we went to  the dead-house to examine the limb, which is to be shown at the Army Medical Society tonight.  After dinner I went to see the   patient; he feels much more comfortable; his mother has beencaring for him and wished the operation performed.""</blockquote> Wilder's Experiences Provides a Major Contribution to Civil War Sources  <p>This remarkable passage from <i>Reflections of a Civil War Medical Cadet</i>, page 73, is almost commonplace throughout the book. Richard M. Reid, author of <i>Practicing Medicine in a Black Regiment: The Civil War Diary of Burt G. Wilder, 55th Massachusetts</i>, continues to mine the Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections of Cornell University Library for Civil War surgeon Burt Wilder's never before published manuscripts. This fascinating volume cover's Wilder's early service as a medical cadet.</p><p>During July 1862, Wilder left Boston to join Dr. Francis Brown, a surgeon working at Judiciary Square Hospital, one of the initial pavilion-style hospitals in Washington, D.C. He had neared the end of a Harvard course of study in comparative anatomy and had offered to serve as a friend's military substitute. Brown's offer of hospital duty was quite appealing to Wilder.</p><p>He left Boston on July 15 and was soon serving as a medical cadet in training. Immersed by the wounded from the Peninsula Campaign, nearly overwhelmed by the wounded of Second Manassas, and inundated by another wave arrived from Sharpsburg, Maryland, Wilder rose above the tide of their agony. He managed this in part by studying nightly for the medical cadet exam offered on October 8, which he passed.</p><p>Congress created the medical cadet position during the summer of 1861 in response to the medical crisis created by the wounded of First Manassas. Medical cadets were to act as dressers in hospitals and ambulance attendants when on campaigns. They would have the same rank and pay as the military cadets at West Point. Qualifications were males between the ages of 18 and 23 who had a liberal education as students of medicine, or who had been reading medicine for two years or had attended at least one course of lectures at a medical college. By November 1861 it became apparent that they were of great service in the fields and hospitals, quickly becoming efficient under surgeons who proctored them. Fifty more cadet positions were added to the Medical Service. Though Wilder did not have the specified requirements, he did have the appropriate recommendations from several practicing surgeons.</p><p>Soon after his arrival at the Judiciary Square Hospital, Wilder's talents caught the eye of Dr. John Brinton, a senior officer in the Medical Department. He had arrived for service just as the Medical Department began to consider the production and dissemination of medical knowledge such as writing case histories, debating unfamiliar wounds and illnesses, and providing encourage to those surgeons who wished to write and publish their observations and conclusions. The Washington, D.C. meetings of the Army Medical Society, initially open to only army surgeons and senior medical officers, began to welcome interested cadets who showed medical and surgical competencies.</p><p>When Richard M. Reid examined Wilder's nearly completed manuscript, he found that Wilder had drafted his recollections by drawing heavily upon his wartime letters to Sarah C. Nichols, whom he later married. Also, he turned to his friend and medical cadet James Adams' personal diary; they had entered military cadet service at the same time. Wilder also examined private and public records, from both of military and hospital archives or collections. He accessed the Judiciary Square Hospital ward books located in the Army Medical Museum and interviewed fellow doctors and former patients whom he located through the Pension Bureau. Furthermore, Wilder found published and private accounts of patients who passed through the Judiciary Square Hospital and doctors who practiced military medicine during the war.</p><p>Working as an historian works, Wilder researched until he could explain conflicting eyewitness testimony. There were both favorable and unfavorable recollections of the work done at the hospital. To his manuscript Wilder added 16 appendices which contained brief biographic sketches of those mentioned in the text and also explained tasks performed by surgical dressers, acting medical cadets, and the medical officer of the day. Wilder diagrammed the wards, showing the positions of the bed, stoves, nurse's room, scullery, latrines, bath rooms and water closets of the wards.</p><p>Also in the appendices, Wilder remarks on the dimensions of the hospitals, the appearance of the medical cadet shoulder strap, the creation of the war books, the cadets' struggles with medical Latin, and even his decision to obtain the brain of Daniel Webster, a Federal soldier, before Webster's father arrived and claimed his son's body. Wilder also, in an appendix, offers a rebuke to nurse and poet, Walt Whitman.</p><p>Richard M. Reid's introduction to Wilder's manuscript is exceedingly helpful. He offers insights to Wilder's research techniques and writing style, assessing the importance of Wilder's Recollections as historical source material. Reid places antebellum medical education and surgical care into an American Civil War context and offers a brief history of the army medical department and its newly created hospitals and medical staffs. He summarizes how life in the Judiciary Square Hospital reflected the medical reforms created during the war. Additionally he describes the recent scholarship found in Shauna Devine's <i>Learning from the Wounded</i>, Margaret Humphrey's <i>Marrow of Tragedy</i> and Susan-Mary Grant's essay ""Mortal in This Season.""</p><p>Overall, Reid's Reflections of a Civil War Medical Cadet, Burt Green Wilder is a superb work of editing and elucidation. It should be essential reading for anyone interested in Civil War Medicine.</p><p><i>Rea Andrew Redd, is director of the Eberly Library at Waynesburg University and is an adjunct instructor of American History there.

5439	9780674050181	$39.95	Look at Lincoln:   Lincoln and Liberalism		Burt, John			"<p> During our Abraham Lincoln spring, one cannot fail to notice the attention fixed on the 16th president who continues to preoccupy us through a wide variety of interpretations -- both popular and scholarly -- that pervade so many aspects of modern culture.  This new and weighty book by John Burt, a Professor of English at Brandeis University, examines anew the meaning of the Lincoln-Douglas Debates -- how to resolve fundamental conflict in an open society.</p><p> In June 1858, when he accepted his nomination for a seat in the United States Senate, Lincoln directly, in one of his greatest and most controversial speeches, challenged Stephen A. Douglas and the Democratic Party's beliefs.  His House-Divided speech proclaimed, ""A house divided against itself cannot stand.  I believe this government cannot endure permanently half <i>slave</i> and half<i> free</i>.""  Although Lincoln emphasized that he did not expect the House to fall or the Union to dissolve, he did expect that it would cease to be divided.  Two months later, the debate series began.</p><p> There have been other respected books written about the Lincoln-Douglas Debates during the election in Illinois.  For example, Harry V. Jaffa, Harold Holzer, Allen C. Guelzo, Rodney O. Davis and Douglas L. Wilson have each made useful contributions to one of the most important events in United States political history.  Is there anything new to add?</p><p> Burt examines the debates from the perspective of ""liberalism.""  But what is meant by this term?  Classical liberalism or modern liberalism?  Liberal democracy?  Liberal political parties?  He transforms Lincoln and Douglas into the embodiments of liberal thinkers such as John Rawls, Immanuel Kant and Alexis de Tocqueville.  The author argues that the ""hope of liberal politics is that it can establish a tradition of fair dealing among people of different interests and views.""  (10)  To him, Lincoln and Douglas, ""sought, in different ways, to work out the relationship between principle and consent in liberal politics, and neither was fully successful in enabling liberal politics to mediate the conflict over slavery.""  (15)</p><p> According to Burt, Abraham Lincoln's approach to slavery is depicted in three main themes: ""the implicitness of concepts,"" ""reverse Burkeanism,"" and ""tragic pragmatism.""  (4-5)  ""Tragic pragmatism"" is ""characteristic of Lincoln's analysis of the political conflicts of his own era.""  (5)  It is the overriding wish ""to keep the promises the Founders committed their nation to,"" but ""one always discovers that the exigencies of history unfold new demands out of these concepts, demands our generation has almost inevitably failed.""  So, this historic moral conflict and the Lincoln-Douglas confrontation about the legitimacy of slavery had a long-lasting and profound effect on Americans.</p><p> The author's balanced analysis of Stephen A. Douglas, who wound up losing, marks the book as a judicious one.  Burt insists that Douglas ""is not the villain of this book, although I hope I see his flaws, especially his virulent and passionate racism, with sufficient clarity.""  (20)  While examining Lincoln's claim against Douglas in the House-Divided Speech that the incumbent senator was part of a conspiracy to force slavery everywhere, Burt suggests it was done ""only for strategic reasons.""  (94)</p><p> Burt challenges Harry Jaffa by viewing Lincoln, and Douglas, ""within the liberal tradition, and connect(s) them with Kant, Madison and Tocqueville rather than Plato and Aristotle.""  (10)  ""[U]nlike Jaffa,"" Burt does ""not think Lincoln overpowers Douglas on every point""""  (10)</p><p> For Burt, Lincoln's reading of the Declaration of Independence as antislavery was transformative for Lincoln.  Burt believes that Abraham Lincoln understood that the Declaration was not fixed in 1776 but fluid and awaiting a move to the basic ideals of the Founders and their documents as history permits.  The core question raised here is how can a liberal (which is to say politically pluralistic) society justly engage in a non-negotiable moral position (in this case, that slavery is evil)?</p><p> Despite its bulk -- some 800 pages -- this is a worthwhile book since the Lincoln-Douglas Debates brought the issue of slavery and race to the forefront before the Civil War began and tragic pragmatism and moral conflict would shape American history.</p><p><i>Frank J.

The collection of essays assembled here present this reconstructed literary world with compelling depth and force. The core of the volume works to understand the Americas as a contiguous space. This space shared Spanish language and rapidly changing population dynamics. The authors explore Spanish-language discussion of ideas with fresh eyes and, in the process, challenge an American literary tradition that typically embraces and English-only, New England- centric bias that fetishizes author over text. <i>The Latino Nineteenth Century</i> eschews nation-state identities in favor of the connections of language and shared experience.</p>    <p>The authors examine a diverse range of literary examples in constructing and illustrating the essential argument that <i>Latino</i> used in the context of the nineteenth century is not an anachronism. Instead, <i>Latino</i> represented a thriving literary exchange outlining  a vast swathe of geographic space. From Mexican railroad fiction, to California during the gold rush, to Cuba. Even New England, taken to task for its English bias in the past and present, still emerges as a center for <i>Latino</i> dialogue if one knows how to hear the meaning. While the authors engage with the behemoth to the North, they do so without falling into the trap of allowing the text to reorient around the U.S. Instead, the authors of <i>The Latino Nineteenth Century</i> deftly navigate how Latinos absorbed English literature, as well as the forgotten prominence of Spanish language literature that is obscured in retrospect, but apparent in context.</p>   <p>It\'s also worth noting that the book is refreshingly self-conscious, resisting the New England-centric reading of the nineteenth century without jettisoning the importance of places like Philadelphia as part of the mutable ethno-geographic space of <i>Latino</i> America. Naturally, the book is rooted in reading texts, and the archive work on display in <i>The Latino Nineteenth Century</i> is exceptional and well documented. Much of the remapped literary work, while lost to English-language bias of the field, survives in a plethora of periodicals and publications with far reaching audiences. They were simply audiences who could read Spanish. In many cases these works of literature, art and other medias of expression had to be rediscovered, adding to the intrinsic value of the text as a bibliographic resource. <i>The Latino Nineteenth Century</i> gives breath to voices that had been lost to the untended memory of a thriving international and intra-national conversation.</p>  <p>Ultimately, <i>The Latino Nineteenth Century</i> is a compelling piece of scholarship with a great deal to say about the way academics draw the borders of nationality, whether intentionally or not. The book also offers a careful examination of the lingering biases crafted by the limitations and intimacies generated by language and geography. These factors filter out critical details of history well within reach, but concealed behind a veil of inexplicable ignorance in the modern field; that one can study a subject in translation. It is, after all through the intimacy of language that the authors link the intertextuality of their subjects and rediscover their forgotten sources. <i>The Latino Nineteenth Century</i> isn't just a good book, it's an important one in reorganizing the way that Latin American studies conceives of the generation and periodization of Latin American identity, as well as the genuinely massive scope of its national borders drawn irreverent of the nation-state borders found on any map. This book is required reading for Latin Americanists, and highly recommended to any reader with even a passing interest on the subject for its density and efficiency.</p>  <p><i>James Wilkey is a doctoral student at Louisiana State University, where he studies the history of Latin American Popular Culture, with a Specialty in Cuba and Cuban Diaspora.</i></p>"	Wilkey, James	Spring 2017	2017-5-1	Review			NYU Press		Military;Politics;Social_History			"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=243 alt=\""Product Cover\"" border=0 src=\""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/latinof.jpg\"">"							
6623	9781316643488	$24.95	The Weeping Time: Memory and the Largest Slave Auction in American History		Bailey, Anne C.			"<p>Anne C. Bailey's latest book, <i>The Weeping Time: Memory and the Largest Slave Auction in American History</i> adds to the historiography of the domestic slave trade by focusing on the too often neglected and inhumane practice of the slave auction. Bailey examines the largest recorded slave auction in the country's history which was held in Savannah, Georgia. On March 2 and 3 1859, buyers from across the country assembled at the Tenbroeck Racetrack where they purchased 436 men, women, and children from the Butler plantations of the Sea Islands. The reason for the sale was the reckless spending of Pierce Mease Butler, who had inherited his grandfather's, Major Pierce Butler, plantations.  By 1859, bad investments in the stock market and the fallout of the Panic of 1857 had finally caught up with Butler, forcing trustees to take control of his Sea Island property, and consequently selling most of his slaves to settle his debts. Bailey persuasively argues that the auction, known as the Weeping Time, and its accompanying history, provides historians with a prism through which to better view the connection between black and white families, who lived parallel lives, yet shared linked fates due to slavery. The Weeping Time and thousands of other slave auctions attempted to deny both the generational connections within slave families and the interconnectedness between slaves and masters.</p>  <p>With a total of nine succinct chapters, Bailey divides her book into three main themes or sections: the Breach, Linked Fates, and the Healing of the Breach.  The first section is about the auction and the devastating breach it caused in the Butler slave families. According to Bailey, slavery was first and foremost an enemy of the family.  Relying on a contemporary account of the auction written by Mortimer ""Doesticks"" Thomson, a reporter for the New York Tribune who posed as a buyer, Bailey opens the book with a vivid, heart wrenching account of the auction. With a novelist's flair for storytelling and a historian's eye for detail, Bailey brings to life the anticipation of the buyers, and the raw emotions of the men, women, and children who were poked, prodded, and then sold away to the highest bidder.  However, Bailey argues that the origins for the dissolution of the Butler slave families began at the Constitutional Convention in 1787 when Major Pierce Butler and other delegates ignored the morality of slavery in order to create the Constitution. Southern delegates were only willing to recognize the humanity of blacks when it benefited white political power: for example, their insistence that blacks be counted as equal to whites when determining representation in Congress. According to Bailey, it was this legacy of denial -- denial of black humanity and of black and white interconnectedness--that the elder Butler passed on to his grandson in addition to his estate and slaves. And this prolonged denial of black humanity would have devastating effects on the Butlers, their slaves, and the nation.</p><p>Indeed, the second theme of parallel lives and linked fates is best exemplified by a chapter on Pierce Butler's 1834 marriage to actress and abolitionist Fanny Kemble. Perhaps Pierce Butler, so smitten, chose to ignore Kemble's abolitionist views, which she did not hide while they courted in Philadelphia.  Fanny abhorred slavery, as she believed any Englishman or woman should, since slavery was illegal in England. However, in this regard, Kemble denied her own and England's connections to southern slavery. After all, as Bailey points out, it was southern cotton that fueled England's textile industry and comprised the clothing that Kemble and other Europeans desired. While visiting the Butler Island plantation for the first and only time in 1839, Kemble took special interest in the slaves, noting both their physical and moral conditions. She even agreed to educate a slave boy named Aleck despite it being against the law. After returning to Philadelphia, their marriage was on the rocks. Kemble demanded that her husband free his slaves or the marriage was over.  Over the next several years, the couple lived together sporadically, but it was at best a tumultuous relationship, with Kemble accusing Butler of infidelity and he accusing her of abandonment.  By 1849, the court granted Butler a divorce, which estranged Kemble from her two daughters throughout their childhood. Eventually, even her two daughters would divide over the issue of slavery, as the younger daughter sided with her father and the oldest daughter shared her mother's abolitionism. The Butler family's disintegration due to slavery foreshadowed the breakup of the Butler slaves' families, and the national family. In this way, Bailey continuously and seamlessly connects the lives and labor of the Butler slaves to those of their masters, both before and after the Civil War.</p>   <p>The third theme and final section of the book, the healing of the breach sees Bailey's cogent argument relying on genealogy and oral history in addition to the existing record to tell the story of the Weeping Time from the perspective of the Butler ex-slaves and their descendants.  Bailey filled the historical gaps of the former Butler slaves' lives with evidence collected from interviews with their living descendants, who had conducted their own extensive genealogical research. With the aid of the descendants' research, Bailey was able to trace the lives of fifty-nine men, women, and children of the original 436 slaves that were sold. Furthermore, Bailey's use of oral history makes the Weeping Time also about recovery and reinvention for the former Butler slaves and their descendants.  After the war, the Butler ex-slaves exercised their newfound freedom by assembling their shattered families, which was a top priority.  Many who had been sold in 1859 returned to the Butler plantation or placed advertisements in newspapers in search of family.  Also, they negotiated new patterns of work with the Butlers who expected that their former slaves would simply acquiesce to slavery work patterns.  Not so. As Bailey points out, the freedmen had their own ideas; for example, working for only six hours per day and not at all on Saturdays. The Butlers, as other former masters, became so frustrated with the freedmen's independence that they brought in Chinese laborers to work their General's Island plantation.  Furthermore, Bailey demonstrates that the freedmen, in the face of great peril, audaciously exercised their new civil rights in a variety of ways including applying for pensions from the federal government, obtaining an education, learning new job skills, and, importantly, voting.</p><p>Bailey's work is a must read for scholars of the domestic slave trade, but her arguments are also in conversation with multiple historiographies including the African Diaspora and Reconstruction.  The author's three-dimensional examination of the former Butler slaves traces the origins of their agricultural know-how, music, cuisine, and spiritual beliefs back to their West African heritage.  By recognizing this lineage, the author resurrects the humanity of the ex-Butler slaves, while simultaneously connecting their lives and labor to larger economic and social developments such as the transatlantic slave trade, the Industrial Revolution, and the pivotal Civil War.  The book is also a valuable addition to the study of the history of black families through its focus on historical memory and oral history. Although Bailey is careful to point out that there is not a straight casual line from slavery to the current state of black families, the Weeping Time and its companion history shows that blacks have continuously fought to maintain familial integrity against overwhelming, and often times, insidious outside forces, and that the black family was and remains a resilient institution.</p>  <p><i>Benjamin Fitzpatrick is an instructor of history at Morehead State University.

6578	802874827	$26.00	The Religious Life of Robert E. Lee		Cox, R. David			"<p>At a time when Confederate memorials to him are being removed from public spaces, Robert E. Lee's memory continues to be controversial. In the heated debates over statues of him, much of the myth of Lee created by the Lost Cause still resonates, including his Christianity. Every historian and biographer has made reference to the general's faith and some writers still venerate him as the quintessential Christian gentleman or even the Christ-like part of a Lost Cause ""trinity"" that also includes Stonewall Jackson and Jefferson Davis. In his 2017 book, <i>The Religious Life of Robert E. Lee</i>, R. David Cox rejects the marble man too often portrayed in popular history and memory in favor of introducing his readers to the real Lee, a man of faith whose religion did indeed shape his life and character. But rather than a stone statue of a saint or the hypocrisy of a Christian slaveholder, Cox reveals a Christian soldier who struggled with his faith as he made his spiritual journey as an evangelical Episcopalian in 19th century Virginia. In a deeply-researched book that grounds its subject in the context of the past, Cox reminds us that the measured tones and nuance of historical scholarship remain the necessary antidote to the passions of current politics and the corrective to mythology. Historically examining Lee's religious beliefs helps us understand the man and the contradictions and paradoxes of his life.</p>	<p>Cox, an Episcopal priest who served as rector at the R.E. Lee Memorial Episcopal Church in Lexington, Virginia before becoming a history professor at Southern Virginia University, looks at his subject with both a critical and contextual eye. His unique position allows him to have empathy with Lee's beliefs and struggles in the faith even as he is able to judge him historically. Basing his interpretation on deep archival research, Cox traces the roots of Lee's religion, drawing especially on personal letters. He studies the family's long practice within the Anglican tradition and shows how his subject was raised in a Christian home formed by parents that emphasized different aspects of the faith. Cox argues that Lee's Christianity shaped his character, serving as the foundation of his personal honor, his understanding of his position as a Virginia patrician, and his duties as a soldier. This leads to a generally sympathetic view of Lee, as it effectively explains the greatest paradoxes of his life. But one wonders, for example, whether or not the ethics of honor played more of a role than Cox shows. The author does not fall into the trap of avoiding Lee's slaveholding and views on race, a problem that plagued previous writers who saw him sympathetically. Instead, Cox directly takes on the issue and casts Lee's views in the context of the time, judging him in ways that allows room for both racism and paternalism, individual respect paid to people of color, and the mistreatment of slaves.</p> 	<p>Family and the home are central to Cox's interpretation of Lee's religion. Like many others in the nineteenth century, Lee understood his faith in ways that intertwined religion with family. This informed his own childhood, his marriage, and his views of slavery. The reader learns how the Christian faith, even within the same Episcopal Church, allowed different individuals to emphasize different ideas and have different experiences and understandings of spiritual matters. One example is how Lee and his wife differed in their experience, as she underwent an evangelical conversion and was more emotional while he had no such crisis moment and took a more rational approach to his beliefs. Lee was devout and regularly attended church services. But more important than his outward practice was his inward character, as he was a man shaped by his faith as it informed his understanding of family, class, race, gender, patriotism, and duty. Cox expertly shows how his paternalism mixed with Lee's Christian doctrines, creating a complex character who simultaneously held to paradoxical ideas that often seemed contradictory.</p>	<p>In addition to a full treatment of race and slavery, in which he shows that Lee's views were typical for his time, Cox focuses on two incidents that demonstrated the general's religious life. The first came when Lee, an American patriot who had served with distinction and fulfilled his duty in the U.S. Army for many long years, chose to decline command of the military forces being mustered to put down the rebellion. Instead, he resigned and joined the Confederacy, a choice that reflected both the context of loyalty to the state rather than the nation and his religious beliefs. Even though he opposed secession and loved the United States, he believed it was his duty, his calling, to stand with the state Virginia rather than with the country. The second incident came after the war, when Lee accepted the presidency of Washington College and promoted reconciliation between the North and the South. For Cox, Lee rose to the level of personal greatness in the post-war period, as he saved the college, the local church, and the South itself. Unable to overcome his personal views and context on matters of race, Lee did not lead the way toward progress in the relationship between blacks and whites. But his work as an educator, parishioner, and Confederate hero all reflected how he accepted the new reality of defeat and faced it with resignation and determination, both of which were born of his Christian faith. Although he self-servingly thought he had always tried to do the right thing, Lee tried to accept God's will in changing circumstances, even when it meant that his efforts proved to be in vain. In 1861, he believed that God called him to fight for the Confederacy. In 1865, he thought that God wanted him to lead the way toward reconciliation. Only when seen in light of Lee's faith and the context of his life do such actions make sense. Cox does a great service in clearly explaining Lee's complex Christianity and his book should be read by both scholars and general readers alike. Such insightful clarity is refreshing in a time when minds are divided by bitter debate over the often-distorted memories of a controversial figure who was later memorialized in statues and enlisted in the ranks of those fighting the culture wars and the political battles of the early twentieth and the early twenty-first centuries.</p>	<p><i>A.

6582			Civil War Treasures:  Encrypted Criticism in the 18th New York Infantry		Rasmussen, Hans			"<p>Discussion of codes and ciphers in the Civil War naturally focuses on those used by armies and governments, but the LSU Libraries Special Collections holds a personal letter in which a sergeant of the 18th New York Infantry Regiment employed a cipher to criticize the lieutenants in his company for their bad character.  Whether fearing discovery by nosey comrades, Union censors, or curious relatives, his encryption of key words concealed the most telling details of a message that lamented the low quality of camp life in the Union army at the start of the war.</p><p>George Blake (1839-1908) was born in Waterford, New York, on June 22, 1839.  He enlisted at Albany, New York, on May 7, 1861, and was mustered in as sergeant in Company H of the 18th New York Infantry Regiment ten days later.<sup>1</sup>  The regiment had been organized at Albany on May 13 for two years' service under the command of Colonel William A. Jackson.  Company H was comprised of recruits from Middletown and Albany and fell under the command of Capt. Peter Hogan, a highly respected thirty-three-year-old civil engineer and Mexican War veteran from Albany.  His first lieutenant was twenty-one-year-old Theodore Caldwell Rogers, also of the state's capital.  Rogers was the eldest child of a Presbyterian minister who had traveled widely in his youth and received an engineering degree from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York.  Well respected by his friends and his father's congregation, Rogers gave up a promising commercial career to join the regiment.  William Ellicott Carmichael of Middletown was the company's second lieutenant.<sup>2</sup></p><p>During his two years of service, George Blake sent numerous letters to his second cousin, Eliza Button (b. 1841), daughter of Lysander Button (1810-1898), a prominent inventor and manufacturer of steam fire engines in Waterford, New York.  In an early letter dated October 29, 1861, George Blake candidly yet surreptitiously conveyed his unfavorable opinion of his company's lieutenants, Theodore Rogers and William Carmichael.<sup>3</sup> Although he wrote mostly in plain (if poorly spelled) English, Blake concealed several telling words with a private cipher that he apparently had arranged to use with his cousin before his departure.  Not especially difficult to break, the code was an assortment of symbols corresponding to specific letters (e.g., A = /, D = ), I = V, N = (, O = <, U = ^ ).

Hogan, suffering from bronchitis, could not perform his duties as company commander and resigned effective November 6, 1861.  Consequently, everyone was bumped up in rank on that day: Theodore Rogers to captain, William Carmichael to first lieutenant, and George Blake to first sergeant.<sup>4</sup>  Whatever misgivings Sgt. Blake had about his new captain's courage under fire, Theodore Rogers ultimately proved himself when he was killed at the Battle of Gaines's Mill, Virginia, on June 27, 1862, deliberately putting himself in harm's way as he bravely rallied his company.  Blake himself suffered a wound to his right shoulder at Gaines's Mill.  Lieut. Carmichael stayed in the rear that day because of illness and an injury he had sustained earlier when thrown from his horse.  He resigned the following month.  Sgt. George Blake recuperated and rejoined his company, finally being mustered out of service with the rest of the 18th New York Infantry on May 28, 1863, their two years' service complete.<sup>5</sup></p><p>_________________</p><p><sup>1</sup> Ryan A.

6529			Civil War Treasures:  David F. Boyd: Eyewitness to Reconstruction		Rasmussen, Hans			"<p>Faced with the challenge of reviving the struggling, impoverished, and lately shuttered Louisiana State Seminary of Learning & Military Academy after the Civil War, David French Boyd, a former Confederate colonel and now the school's superintendent, had good reason to appreciate the volatile political situation in Louisiana during Reconstruction.  He often traveled from Baton Rouge, where the newly styled but still beleaguered Louisiana State University shared quarters with the Louisiana Institution for the Deaf, Dumb and Blind, to New Orleans, site of the Republican-controlled state government.  There he often witnessed thrilling political events and developments that he documented in two types of correspondence held in the Louisiana State University Office of the Chancellor records.  The first are two series of telegrams Boyd sent from New Orleans to university officials in Baton Rouge during two particularly chaotic occasions: the attempted impeachment of Republican governor Henry Clay Warmoth in January 1872 and the Battle of Liberty Place in September 1874.  Joining these anxious messages is a pair of letters David Boyd wrote to General William Tecumseh Sherman, whom he had befriended before the war, offering his commentary on the political situation in Louisiana following two contentious gubernatorial elections in 1872 and 1876.</p><p>The quarrel between loyalists of Governor Warmoth and the rival Custom House faction of the Republican Party finally came to a head in January 1872 when the latter bloc followed Republican Speaker of the House George W. Carter into an alliance with the Democrats for an ultimately unsuccessful conspiracy to impeach the governor.  Fifteen handwritten telegrams sent to Baton Rouge from New Orleans, first by James W. Crawford, a benefactor of the university from Baton Rouge,<sup>1</sup> then by David Boyd, conveyed the palpable tension of the times.  The witnesses described a frantic atmosphere of the governor facing arrest, partisan legislatures vying for legitimacy, federal troops coming to Warmoth's aid, the balance of power apparently shifting here and there, riots feared to be imminent (but never materializing), and the university suffering without support from a legislature with no mind to do anything constructive.  Boyd found the matter largely at an end by January 23: ""Legislative matters quieting down considerably.  Carter's party will I think fall to pieces & the Legislature will no doubt be earnestly at work tomorrow, but as the fight is political not real, no one knows what a day may bring.""<sup>2</sup></p><p>Near the end of that same year, Boyd wrote to William Tecumseh Sherman, then Commanding General of the US Army in Washington, giving an extensive commentary on the political situation in Louisiana.  Boyd had known Sherman before the war when he joined the inaugural faculty of the Louisiana State Seminary of Learning & Military Academy in Pineville, where Sherman served as the first superintendent between 1859 and 1861.  They had maintained contact both during and after the war, so on December 27, 1872, Boyd did not hesitate to convey a vivid report expressing his thorough disgust over the recent disputed gubernatorial election.  In his fantastic account, he described the outrageous political machinations of both sides, including purposefully deceptive ballots and blatantly partisan returning boards.  Curiously, Boyd admitted a newfound sympathy for the roundly vilified Governor Warmoth, who had broken with the Grant administration to join with the Liberal Republican Party, suggesting a faint hope for Louisiana's Democrats: ""Many Democrats at once recognized <u>in him and in his Republican influence</u> their only chance, they thought, for freeing our State from Carpet-bag and negro rule.  I was one of them, and was in that minority of Democrats that wished to run him for Governor, and finally put him in the U.S. Senate.""  Nonetheless, too many Democrats opposed a possible fusion ticket, which kept Warmoth off the ballot and ultimately led to the state's present abysmal situation ""placing a vile, ignorant negro in the Governor's chair "" and giving us for a Legislature the most degraded and depraved set of men (almost without any exception) of the same number that can be found, even in the State Penitentiary.""<sup>3</sup></p><p>David Boyd had the misfortune to be in New Orleans trying to rescue the university's precarious finances two years later when the White League defeated the Metropolitan Police and the state militia in the famous Battle of Liberty Place on September 14, 1874, briefly removing Governor William Pitt Kellogg in favor of the Democratic claimant, John McEnery.  Already on September 10, Boyd sensed trouble brewing, writing William Van Pelt, the university's clerk, ""I telegraphed you again to-day there is plenty of money here; but with the whole population likely at any moment to get at each other by the ears, you may judge how hard it is to get (borrow) it.""  On September 14, everything blew up, sending a political crisis reverberating across the state and setting off a flurry of frantic telegrams between Boyd and Van Pelt:</p><p>September 14, 1874, Boyd to Van Pelt: ""Can do nothing today.  Much excitement.  Trouble expected.  Kellogg asked to resign and refuses.  Tell Garig our situation.""<sup>4</sup></p><p>September 15, 1874, Boyd to Van Pelt: ""All business suspended.  State House Arsenal and Public Offices in charge of Citizens.  Kellogg's Resignation rumored.""</p><p>September 16, 1874, Boyd to Van Pelt: ""Did you receive my dispatch of Monday in time to stop payment?  Answer.  Penn fully in Power today but I fear Federal interference.""<sup>5</sup></p><p>September 18, 1874, Van Pelt to Boyd: ""The citizens have directed Major Bird of McEnery's Militia to remove our guns today to a more secure place.""</p><p>September 18, 1874, Boyd to Van Pelt: ""Presume the Citizens have acted for the best by all means do not let my Guns fall into the hands of the negrows [sic].  Say to Maj. Bird to use my Guns if ne[ce]ssary to repel any attack by negrows [sic] in Baton Rouge.""<sup>6</sup></p><p>The restoration of Kellogg to power by federal authorities on September 18 put the affair to an end, but the animosities of Reconstruction continued to seethe for nearly three more years.  On January 24, 1877, as the nation grappled with the dilemma of deciding the Hayes-Tilden dispute and Louisiana faced her own predicament with two claimants to the governorship -- the Republican Stephen B. Packard and the Democrat Francis T. Nicholls -- David Boyd once again wrote to General Sherman to apprise him of the political situation in the Bayou State.  He recently had visited New Orleans for a meeting of the Board of Supervisors where he took advantage of opportunities to take the pulse of the city, which he offered as a starkly frank conclusion.  Boyd's letter revolved around a single observation: ""Whether Genl. Nicholls is allowed to be Governor or not, the people of La. will <u>not</u> permit <u>Mr. Packard</u> to be <u>Governor</u>; nor will they allow <u>his</u> government to be organized.""  He conveyed the popular frustration that had built over years of Republican rule in the state specifically, but hesitated to speculate very much on the national presidential contest.  Instead, Boyd chose to emphasize local disinterest in the brewing national compromise, remarking, ""Yes, the thinki[ng] is that the presidency seems to hinge, in a great measure, on the electoral vote of <u>La.</u> -- about which <u>our people of La.</u> care comparatively nothing.  They w[oul]d prefer Tilden, but will cheerfully accept Mr. Hayes, if he be president.  But let me tell you that <u>the people of La. will not accept Mr. Packard as their Governor, nor submit to him at all, as such, under any circumstances</u>!""<sup>7</sup></p><p>In the end, David Boyd was right about the political situation in Louisiana, not that it took much acumen to read it.  White Democratic resentment over Warmoth, Pinchback, Kellogg, Packard, and the rest always was plain to see and the fever pitch of resentment that Boyd observed in 1877 was undeniable.  Regardless, his knack for being in New Orleans for Reconstruction's more consequential moments has blessed us with a fascinating archive of documents among Louisiana State University's other official records with which to appreciate that pivotal era.</p><p><a href=http://www.louisianadigitallibrary.org/cdm/singleitem/collection/LSU_UAP/id/2454/rec/225>David F.

6362			Civil War Treasures:  The Efficacy of Confederate Relics in the Poetry and Short Fiction of One Southern Family		Rasmussen, Hans C.			"<p>In an interview with a Baton Rouge radio station in 1968, John Hazard Wildman, an author and English professor at Louisiana State University, explained his inspiration for ""The Sword,"" a short story that soon would appear in LSU's esteemed literary journal, <i>The Southern Review</i>.  He recalled his great aunt, the younger sister of a Confederate officer who had died in the war, whom he had known when still a boy in Mobile.  Wildman credited her as the model for the story's protagonist, casually revealing, ""Actually, the story is about her.  She suggested it to me.  Her personality -- her pugnacious personality -- and genteel poverty and all sorts of things like that.  Now, actually, the story itself is purely fictitious.  It has nothing much to do with fact, but the pugnacious nature of the lady in it is definitely my great aunt Fannie.""<sup>1</sup>  While Wildman incorporated his great aunt's stoic and sternly dignified personality into the story -- as well as indirect references to his great uncle -- his family also contributed a more critical inspiration for the tale: a piece of poetry copied, perhaps by one of his great aunts, that expressed a precarious faith in the Confederate past and its relics that his own story would repudiate. </p><p>John Boylston Hazard was born on June 6, 1841, in Mobile, Alabama, the only son of Charles Courtlandt Hazard and Cornelia Livingston Hazard.  He served as a captain in the 24th Alabama Infantry Regiment, Company I during the Civil War, and his service and other wartime experiences are documented in a series of letters preserved among his grandnephew's papers.<sup>2</sup>  His correspondents included his parents and siblings Camilla (""Cam""), Cornelia (""Neeny""), Frances (""Fanny""), Mary Whitaker (""Mane""), and brother-in-law, Benjamin Andrews Whitaker (""Ben"").  Hazard was captured at the Battle of Missionary Ridge on November 25, 1863, and transferred to Johnson's Island Prison, a prisoner-of-war camp for Confederate officers on an island in Lake Erie across the bay from Sandusky, Ohio, on December 7.  Suffering from cold and without adequately warm clothing, he took ill and died of diphtheria on December 31, 1863.<sup>3</sup> </p><p>Before he passed away, Captain Hazard entrusted his effects to his first lieutenant, James T. Bell, with the request that he bring his uniform home to his mother.<sup>4</sup>  Whether he did or did not is unknown, but a manuscript poem copied by a member of his family suggests Bell may have succeeded in his pledge.</p> ""The Jacket of Gray"" by Caroline Augusta Ball, first published in 1866, was a sentimental ballad of heartfelt loss that became tremendously popular across the South after the war.<sup>5</sup>  Although the poem expressed devotion to the southern cause, it was far more of an elegy mourning a dead soldier, replete with images of a mother giving up her son to fight and the family grieving bitterly at his death.  Understandably, the poem would have been appreciated by the surviving women of the Hazard family, enough to motivate one of them to make a copy, as a few stanzas demonstrate. </p><blockquote>His young comrades found him, and tenderly bore The cold lifeless form to his home on the shore; Oh, dark were our hearts on that terrible day, When we saw our dead boy in the jacket of gray. </blockquote><blockquote>Ah! spotted and tattered, and stained now with gore, Was the garment which once so he so proudly wore; We bitterly wept as we took it away, And replaced with death's white robes the jacket of gray. </blockquote><blockquote>We laid him to rest in his cold narrow bed, And graved on the marble we placed o'er his head As the proudest tribute our sad hearts could pay --  ""He never disgraced it, the jacket of gray."" </blockquote><p> ""The Jacket of Gray"" was published immediately after the war when memorialization of the Confederate cause focused entirely on mourning the dead, as the better known martial celebration of the Lost Cause awaited a post-Reconstruction future.  Nonetheless, the poem (especially its opening and closing stanzas) revealed an early interest in honoring relics from the war and drawing comfort from their presence. </p><blockquote>Fold it up carefully, lay it aside; Tenderly touch it, look on it with pride; For dear to our hearts must it be evermore, The jacket of gray our loved soldier-boy wore. </blockquote><p>This postwar faith in Confederate relics was a theme that Captain Hazard's grandnephew would treat in his own story a century later, only with a trust less sure. </p><p>The year before his interview, Wildman introduced the inaugural issue of <i>The New South Quarterly</i>, an independent literary journal published by current and former LSU students, with a call for renewal in southern literature.  ""But particularly the South needs this not in any narrow, sectional, parochial, professional sense.  The Stars and Bars have a slashingly bright design and a splendid connotation, but they are worse for literature than an iced-tea glass of cheap gin.""<sup>6</sup>  Regretting how Lost Cause devotion failed to improve southern letters, Wildman decided to undermine this civil religion and its faith in questionable relics. </p><p> ""The Sword"" tells of Emma Garth Markson, an aged southern spinster who lives poor and alone in a rickety old house accompanied only by a cat, nurturing her garden and a fierce sense of familial pride.  She reveres her late uncle's Confederate officer's sword that she had purchased from an unappreciative, ne'er-do-well relative.  It becomes for her a totem to vicariously escape her poverty and celebrate her uncle's ""splendid cause (about whose nature Miss Emma was dogmatically, happily, bigotedly vague).""  She is crestfallen when a predatory antique dealer tells her the sword is not Confederate, but rather a cheap Union sabre.  Another more sympathetic broker reveals the apparently well-known story of how her relative had sold her uncle's sword to a collector in Philadelphia, replacing it with a cheaper federal one she bought in a pawn shop in that city.  The revelations are crushing, compelling her to throw the sword in the garbage and embrace her devastating loss of everything she had held dear.  Instead, she finds solace in a picture of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the kindness of neighbors and relatives before her death.<sup>7</sup> </p><p>Wildman patterned the Confederate uncle after his own great uncle through details of his youth, his officer rank, and his death of disease while a prisoner of war.  The fictional Austen Ullathorne Markson ""was young and quite handsome.  He had had his picture taken in the uniform of a Confederate officer.  Shortly afterwards, he had gone off to war and within a relatively brief time he had been captured.  He had died of smallpox in a Northern prison.""  But unlike the poetic (and perhaps literal) gray jacket in which his ancestors found solace, the false Confederate sword in his short story cannot provide comfort.  Instead, Emma Markson, a devout Catholic, must turn to Christ to cope with her loss. </p><blockquote>"""" She took the picture down and put it on the wall where the sword had hung.In a few days, she found herself unable to do anything, even to loosen the black, natively rich earth around the few larkspur that had survived in a spot half shaded from the fierce sun.  She took to her bed in a spirit of simple inevitability and spent her time partly napping, partly watching the picture, partly in a strange state in which she either held conversations with the picture or was one with it.  ""I've lost everything,"" she once told it; and it answered, ""So did I.  That's the way you find everything."" </blockquote><p>Wildman's dim value of Confederate relics and the traditions that had empowered them, and his corresponding commendation of Christian faith to take their place, undoubtedly arose from his own conversion to Catholicism in 1945.  His assessment was likewise reminiscent of Walker Percy's trenchant evaluation of the inadequacy of southern values that he had expressed in his noted 1956 essay, ""Stoicism in the South.""  Percy, also an Alabama native who similarly had converted to Catholicism in 1947, observed, ""We in the South can no longer afford the luxury of maintaining the Stoa beside the Christian edifice.  In the past we managed the remarkable feat of keeping both, one for living in, the other for dying in. "" The white Southerner, Catholic and Protestant, has been invited either to go inside the [Christian] edifice he has built or to consider what he is doing on the porch at all.""<sup>8</sup>  For Wildman, traditional southern stoicism grimly maintained in genteel poverty was no way to live and false relics possessed no power to redeem; rather, the South needed to embrace its Christian tradition as a more joyful philosophy both to live in and to die in. </p><p>______________________</p><p><sup>1</sup> Audio interview with Orene Muse (1968), John Hazard Wildman Papers, Mss. 1966, 1967, 2010, 2095, 2169, 2237, 2249, 2371, 2437, Louisiana and Lower Mississippi Valley Collections, LSU Libraries, Baton Rouge, La., box 15.</p><p><sup>2</sup> John Hazard Wildman Papers, box 3.</p><p><sup>3</sup> James T.

6632			Alabama's Class Politics through the Civil War Crisis -- and its Echoes		Fitzgerald, Michael W.			"<p>In an overview of the role of ""poor whites"" in Alabama's political development, and of the non-slaveholding majority of whites specifically, one cannot define a simple pattern.  But two broad factors structured Alabama's antebellum evolution.  The first is the commitment to racial supremacy across all classes within the white population.   The other is the strength of an intermingled regional and class resentment in the areas least dominated by slavery, commerce, and cotton production.  Both concerns were strong in Alabama, but they interacted in complex ways, with a sharp disjuncture in the Civil War era.  Both aspects fueled Alabama's central role in the later civil rights confrontations, and the state's subsequent emergence as a conservative Republican stronghold.  Most recently, the state's ""populistic"" heritage encouraged the favorable response to candidate and President Donald Trump.</p>      <p>The state's geography largely determined these patterns.  In the antebellum era, there were two main regions characterized by cotton production and slavery.  The major one was the south central ""black belt"" which stretched across the state, from Selma to Montgomery and beyond, a region dominated by plantations.  A secondary and older plantation region was in the extreme north of the state, in the Tennessee valley surrounding Huntsville.   The rest of the state, particularly the mountain and piedmont areas of the north central region, and the sparsely settled ""wiregrass"" counties of the southeast, were numerically-dominated by white small farmers.  (See appendix one.)  The shorthand version was of an aristocratic cotton belt counterpoised against the democratic inclinations of the hill country, and of north Alabama in general.  Wealth was strikingly concentrated in the central plantation belt, the bulk of the large slaveholdings being located there, while the whites in the non-plantation regions numerically predominated.  The consequence was that the large plantation owners and urban elites couldn't control the electorate, which generated recurrent outbreaks of small-P populism.   These features are perhaps the distinctive aspects of Alabama's development, combined with a defiance of outside sensibilities encouraged by the defense of slavery and racial hierarchy.</p>  <p>At statehood in 1819, a cluster of well-connected large planters in the Tennessee Valley became the state's founding fathers.  Their initial dominance, and their favoritism toward the Planters' and Merchants' Bank of Huntsville, generated widespread resentment of the ""Royal"" faction.  The beneficiary of this sentiment was governor and land speculator Israel Pickens, the improbable first tribune of the masses of the state's later-settled areas.  In the 1820s, Pickens established a state bank to compete with the private banks, a policy which proved wildly profitable.  For several years, the state bank and its paper money funded Alabama's governmental operations, buoying the economy and providing a utopian interlude of public spending with few taxes.  It was nice while it lasted, and it contributed to the overwhelming popularity of the emergent Democratic majority -- in 1828, Andrew Jackson won 90% of the state's presidential vote, he having personally wrested much of Alabama from the Creeks.  But the panic of 1837 bankrupted the bank and absorbed the state's large Federal educational endowment with it.  The responsibility for this disaster was mixed, and the debates over the government's role in banking sustained a lopsided two-party system for decades.</p>  <p>After Native American removal, as white settlement proceeded, the geographic pattern of the state's politics stabilized.  The anti-Jackson Whig party became the vehicle of the rich black belt and Alabama's few cities.  Whigs favored activist government to promote economic growth, and they warily resonated with the national currents of Protestant reform.  They favored promoting banks, protective tariffs, and internal improvements, along with public education and the university.  As J. Mills Thornton argued, they were vigorously opposed by the small farmers of the hill country, who disliked taxes and government schemes to benefit well-connected elites.  Farmers widely resented the social pretentions of the slaveholding rich; they rallied to Jackson's war on the banks and monopolies, and to his unlettered and unbridled personal style.  This proved a winning political formula, given the mal-distribution of wealth that slavery encouraged.  Class and regional disparities fueled Democratic majorities as the party of negative government, of localism and states' rights.  Democrats controlled the state, carrying every statewide contest before the Civil War.  This let them impose tax policies that targeted slave property and favored small farmers.  Alabama's privileged planters and merchants, at least the Whigs among them, thus experienced the odd reality of being locked out of formal power.</p>   <p>Undergirding this political configuration was the state's unity on issues of race, both towards Native Americans and toward African-Americas.  Indian removal opened vast tracts to both white settlement.  Slavery opened avenues of upward mobility for some poorer whites, like overseers, who sometimes entered the planter class.  Also, the emphasis on serving black belt areas in transportation and banking meant widespread property ownership of less productive land elsewhere.  Alabama's limited antebellum industrial development also insured that few whites worked for one another.  Land remained cheap in the hills, with grain for local use and livestock production predominating.  Older values of study independence long remained viable in this setting.  Both parties defended racial slavery as the basis of white liberty, and so long as the external threat looked manageable, citizens could divide on class-related issues.  But the growing salience of slavery expansion after the Mexican War undermined the Whig emphasis on economic development and its support for an active Federal government.  The Whigs went into decline in the 1850s, especially as their former northern allies were drawn into an antislavery Republican party.  But the Democrats' drift toward sectional extremism and secessionism eroded the political system.  They provided opponents occasional opportunities as ""conservative"" friends of the Union.</p>  <p>Even as Civil War approached, economic policy issues and the symbolism surrounding them remained important in state politics.  The collapse of the Whigs, and the cotton boom of the 1850s, encouraged some Democrats to embrace economic modernization, and to favor public education and government subsidies for railroad construction.  This provoked a backwoods backlash in the form of the ""veto-governor"" John Winston.  He vetoed some thirty-odd railroad and pro-development bills, reinvigorating the Democratic crusade against monopolies and the rich.  At decade's end, modernizers again passed a statewide general railroad aid bill, but the secession crisis prevented implementation.  Here too, we see the prevailing pattern of the antebellum era, planter elites and urban modernizers could not impose an activist vision of government upon the state.  In Governor Winston's electoral success, we again see Democratic leadership mobilizing a popular following against the elites, with the external threat to the racial order encouraging supercharged rhetoric on other issues.</p>  <p>Only the earthquake of secession could shake the partisan alignments that insured a Democratic popular majority.  Anti-elite rhetoric remained powerful, but the crisis propelled that sentiment in diverse directions.  In the crucial 1860 presidential elections, the disunited ""conservative"" following maintained some strength, with the Whiggish moderate John Bell doing well in the black belt and cities.  The national Democrat Steven Douglas also gained 15% of the vote, carrying several Tennessee Valley counties in a protest against the Democratic drift toward disunion.  Resistance to states' rights extremism remained a significant force, but the southern rights faction of Democrats backing John C. Breckinridge won the state with 54% of the vote.  They carried most of the party's northern Alabama strongholds, based on traditional loyalties, but the vote's immediate aftermath shook these patterns to the core.</p><p>The national election outcome shocked white Alabamians.  Abraham Lincoln's victory as an antislavery Republican prompted alarm, with South Carolina's secession forcing a crisis.  Most whites probably favored secession in some form, but the issue opened divisions over tactics.  In the December 1860 election to call a secession convention, the geographic patterns of decades dissolved.  South Alabama united behind immediate secession.  That is to say, the plantation areas long prone to Whiggish sectional moderation now went for disunion.  In north Alabama, though, the electorate instead backed a ""cooperationist"" course, either cooperative secession or some ill-defined Union-saving alternative.  (See appendix two).  In the most isolated reaches of the hill country, cooperationist candidates won by large margins, indicating an outright rejection of secession.  Alabama's subsequent secession, and the outbreak of war, reconciled many former skeptics to the Confederate government.  Other anti-secessionists lapsed into sullen noncooperation with the new regime.</p> <p>During this crisis, one can still find little evidence of antislavery sentiment, still less of antiracism, but dramatic events can push people in unpredictable ways.  The sense that poorer men were being railroaded by into a war by secessionist fanatics was widespread, at least in northern Alabama.  The longstanding class grievances, and the localism of the hills, encouraged defeatism or outright Unionism.  Margaret Storey estimates that fifteen per cent of white Alabamians backed the Union strongly.  Belief or local situation trumped class, per se, in determining individuals' wartime loyalties, but Unionism was strongest in the poorest reaches of northern Alabama. The geography of the conflict heightened these sentiments, especially as the war dragged on and demands by the Confederate government grew.  The far northern section was occupied early by Union forces, commencing years of raids and destruction.  This meant that the region least enthusiastic about secession experienced devastation, while the plantation belt long went nearly untouched.  Furthermore, draft evaders and deserters concentrated in the mountains, where capture was difficult and local sentiment often provided protection and food.  Confederate measures to apprehend them drove many into outright Unionism, with some three thousand white men joining the Federal army, and still others resorted to brigandage.  Outright Unionists' reliance on outside aid pushed them toward the Lincoln administration and its emancipation policy -- that is to say, toward apostasy on race and Federal supremacy.  They numerically dominated few counties, so when the southern soldiers finally returned home, open anti-Confederates would be converted into an imperiled minority overnight.  Thus the ""unconditional Unionists,"" and their vulnerability to retaliation, made many into Reconstruction ""scalawags.""  They sought a drastic restructuring of the polity at Republican hands.</p>  <p>By war's end, the outright Unionists were not alone.  A large minority of whites had abandoned an unpopular Confederate cause, and northern Alabama was littered with self-proclaimed Unionists, with minute distinctions in the secession crisis looming large.  Even in the black belt, Whiggish ""conservative"" sentiment reasserted itself as defeat became likely, with a faction seeking a negotiated separate peace for Alabama.  All these groups favored postwar policies designed to keep the state's Democratic and secessionist majority at bay, and to keep the authors of a ruinous war from office.   The hope was that Federal power would encourage restraint, but as President Andrew Johnson's Reconstruction policies handed power into the hands of ex-Confederates, many of these disparate dissidents looked to the Republican Congress and the army for protection.  As Congressional sentiment shifted toward enfranchising southern freedmen as a solution, unconditional Unionists generally backed restoring the state under the terms of the Military Reconstruction acts of 1867.  (See appendix three, for the pattern of white votes for Reconstruction).  So too did some former Whigs and conservatives who saw an opportunity to use the transition to advantage, like Governor Robert M. Patton, who resurrected the long-stalled railroad subsidy measures by collaborating with Congressional Reconstruction.  His hope was that swift restoration of the state to the Union would restore the state's credit, and thus enable subsidy measures.  And so it proved, with fiscally disastrous results.  Here, then, is the class-drenched genesis of Radical Reconstruction, and of its violent overthrow: a counterrevolution that would influence the state's racial politics through the civil rights movement and beyond.</p><p>Examining that process would take us too far afield here.  We might simply say that as the Civil War's resentments cooled, white opinion reunified in opposition to black demands for equality and Federal protection.   They also solidified against the Reconstruction government's activist railroad policies, and the state bankruptcy they engendered.  The result was a fundamentalist Democratic surge after the 1873 depression hit, under White Line slogans of racial resentment.  Redemption gave the reunited Democratic masses what they desired, small government, low taxes, and white supremacy.  The additional consequence was that the Constitution of 1875 provided cotton belt elites a reservoir of captive black votes and resulting legislative overrepresentation.  These were deployed thereafter as circumstances dictated, mostly to beat back agrarian demands.</p><p>The ironic outcome was that restive farmers got what they wanted in Redemption, but not what they needed.  In an industrializing Alabama, with the railroad infrastructure finally built and the Birmingham district booming, negative government and low taxes served black belt planters and urban elites better than it did white farmers.  This fueled Greenbacker and Populist revolts in the subsequent years.  The resulting threat of insurgent, opportunistic biracial electoral coalitions was only eliminated by constitutional disfranchisement in 1901.  After that, for half a century and more, the political settlement insured that lively white class politics occurred within the confines of a one-party state.</p>  <p>The relevance of Alabama's early political development to this outcome seems clear.  From statehood on, interlocking patterns of class and region-based white dissent motivated an anti-elite style of public discourse.  The Civil War disrupted the partisan expression of that sentiment, but not the inclination itself.  It kept returning in such apparently inconsistent forms as the Ku Klux Klan of the 1920s and support for the New Deal in the subsequent decade.  And so, to jump to our time, the recent Senatorial special election results, and the strength of Judge Roy Moore in the small towns and rural areas of northern Alabama, has ample precedent.  Moore may have lost, but President Trump himself benefitted from this tradition of popular defiance of polite sentiment -- even if now often directed at the Establishment of his own Republican party.</p><p><i>Michael W.

6363			Editorial:  Wider Worlds and Historical Legacies		Barber, Tom			"<p>It is a great honor for me to be able to formally introduce myself to our readers. I have been lucky to take over the <i>Civil War Book Review</i> with the support of the staff at LSU Special Collections, and with the journal having been handed off to me in such excellent shape by our previous editor, Zach Isenhower. I look forward to continuing the journal's commitment to providing thoughtful reviews for the latest scholarship on the Civil War and Reconstruction eras. </p><p>Now let's talk about our great Fall 2016 issue. This issue highlights two concepts: place and legacy. </p><p>Claude Clegg reviews Randy J. Sparks <i>Africans in the Old South</i>, which follows the lives of Americans not only of African descent, but also of geographical origin. By doing so, Sparks exposes the cultural, personal, and intellectual networks whose reference points included inland Sierra Leone, South Carolina, Jamaica, and a host of other regions that organized the mental and physical worlds of Africans living in the Old South. </p> <p>Place also shaped American music in important ways. Laurent Dubois's <i>The Banjo: America's African Instrument</i>, reviewed here by Scott Gac, chronicles how the instrument gained notoriety, and later acceptance within the United States. According to Gac, the banjo attained national acceptance only after the cultural processes of ""cooperation, appropriation, and transformation,"" a set of transformations that involved enslaved Africans in the sixteenth century, white consumers in the nineteenth century, and Civil Rights activists in the twentieth century. </p> <p>Reconstruction's legacies form the issue's second theme. Elaine Frantz Parsons' <i>Ku-Klux: The Birth of the Klan During Reconstruction</i> examines how the terrorist group became part of the United States' national imagination. Joshua Hodges points out in his review of <i>Ku-Klux</i>, that the nineteenth-century Klan owed its prolonged notoriety to partisan national papers throughout the North, which used the group's violent tactics, to justify or condemn political reconstruction to the nation at large. </p> <p>James P. Byrd reviews <i>Between Fetters and Freedom: African American Baptists since Emancipation</i>, a collection of essays that interrogates the dual legacies of Emancipation and Reconstruction. Byrd's review suggests that the period between Emancipation and Reconstruction left a mixed legacy in terms of religious freedom. In some instances, Emancipation enabled African American Baptists to embrace new theological concepts. At other times, white backlash to Reconstruction convinced many black Baptists to remain in churches controlled by white officials. </p> <p>Place and legacy also appear in this issue's author interview and featured column. Interviewed this month is Matthew Clavin, author of <i>Aiming for Pensacola: Fugitive Slaves on the Atlantic and Southern Frontiers</i>.

6527			The Uncertain Progress of White Male Democracy: Intimidation and Disenfranchisement before the Civil War		Olsen, Christopher			"<p>Since the contested presidential election in 2000 Americans have become more aware of conflicts over voter eligibility, disputed ballots, and simply access to the polls. More and more states require state-issued identification in order to vote, efforts that have accelerated in the past few years. State legislation and actions by local officials and party operatives have trained the spotlight on what sometimes seem like unfair, or uneven enforcement of, suffrage laws. Those voters most affected tend to be poorer, African American, immigrants or migrants, not fluent in English, or some combination of the above. Certain groups of people, in short, tend to be disenfranchised more often than others. These issues are hardly new, of course. Throughout much of the nineteenth century, before passage of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments and, in particular, before the use of uniform, secret ballots, many voters struggled to assert their legal right to vote or exercise freedom of choice.</p>  <p>Among antebellum historians, one of the most frequently told stories has been the expansion of white male democracy. This proceeded on two major fronts: revisions to the suffrage that made it possible for the vast majority of adult white men to vote by the early 1830s; and (less emphasized) a dramatic increase in the number of offices elected rather than appointed. Historians have often presented these changes as part of a fairly linear progression from less to more democracy in the history of the United States, a narrative running from the colonial period to the late twentieth century. Of course there is much truth in that story, and in recent years it's been well-told again, in broad strokes, by Alexander Keyssar, Sean Wilentz, and others. In turn, historians of antebellum politics have spent a great deal of time writing and arguing about how many people voted, for whom they voted, and either explicitly or implicitly why they voted. The last question tends to rely on the assumption, or inference, that voters made choices based on their understanding of issues or their affiliation to party organizations. People weighed the issues or reacted to partisan imagery, and historians tend to reach conclusions like ""Democrats believed . . ."" and ""Whigs thought . . .""</p> <p>Looking more closely at the action on election day, at the polls, reveals a messier picture of influence and disenfranchisement that disproportionately affected poorer white men. These images complicate broad conclusions about white male democracy and the bases of voting behavior. Antebellum political culture seems best characterized by an ebb and flow of democratic tendencies, and by the appearance of white male democracy as much as the reality. And from the perspective of how voting worked, antebellum elections seem much less ideological or partisan than a narrative that's derived from the writing of politicians or the content of national and state party newspapers.</p>  <p>Studies that consider the mechanics of election day and the polling place tend to include three broad themes: the generalized chaos of the whole thing; a lack of secrecy due to stubborn persistence of <i>viva voce</i> voting and easily identifiable paper ballots; and the relative ease with which poorer men could be disenfranchised. Each of these--and particularly the last--emerge clearly in the testimony from contested elections; when the result was close enough to provoke a challenge both sides targeted poor voters.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>The unruly nature of many polls, especially in heavily populated urban precincts, was frequently mentioned by contemporaries. One voter remembered his own experience in 1859 Virginia. ""I do not know exactly how the vote was taken at said precinct [by voice or ballot]. Some of the votes were taken by ticket -- I could not say how many. They may have nearly all voted in that way -- I do not know. There was considerable [trouble] and disputing around the polls and around where the voting was going on -- so much so that I could not tell how it was conducted."" Other voters often complained of ""pushing and shoving,"" and of course sporadic violence that erupted between partisans or immigrants and Natives. The familiar paintings by George Caleb Bingham capture the polling places described by contemporaries. These scenes cast doubt on the credibility of the process, generally, and call attention to the difficulty of assigning motives to the voters' actions and choices.</p><p><a href=https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=5632371> George Caleb Bingham's The County Election</a></p> <p>The methods of voting underscore more specifically the opportunities for intimidation, influence, and corruption. Voting simply wasn't secret in the vast majority of settings across antebellum America. By the 1830s, most states required paper ballots, but some still practiced <i>viva voce</i> voting. In fact, the transition from voting by voice to paper ballot was incomplete until after the Civil War, as men in Missouri (1863), Virginia (1867), Oregon (1872), and Kentucky (1891) still voted without ballots (and in many local and municipal elections elsewhere). Customarily each voter walked toward the judges and, as one Virginian recalled, called out his name ""in a loud voice. The judges inquired . . . 'for whom do you vote?' [and] He replied by proclaiming the name of his favorite."" Or as one Missouri voter remembered. ""I voted with a ticket which was handed into the crier & it had Wm. Ellis's name upon it & I head the crier call the vote for Ellis.""</p> <p>Public voting opened the whole process to pressure from employers, landlords, and creditors, as well as more ""benign"" sources such as family and neighbors. The list of ""vulnerable"" voters was long and probably obvious: poor farmers who relied on seasonal help from wealthier neighbors; tenants; journeymen dependent on masters or shop owners; factory workers; and so forth. Most states ended oral voting between the Revolution and the dramatic expansion of white male suffrage in the early nineteenth century--when so many of these poorer folks became voters: Vermont in 1797; Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Maryland in 1799; Delaware in 1811; New Jersey in 1821, New York the following year; and so forth. New states admitted in the nineteenth century generally provided for ballots on their admission to the Union--Ohio, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, and Wisconsin, among others. Others held out longer: Maine and Vermont moved to ballots in the 1830s; Connecticut and Arkansas not until the 1840s. Still others moved back and forth from <i>viva voce</i> to paper ballots. Illinois, for instance, entered the Union with oral voting, went to paper the following year (1819), back to <i>viva voce</i> in 1821, paper in 1823, and <i>viva voce</i> from 1829 to 1848.</p> <p>Paper ballots hardly solved the problem of independence since they weren't uniform in size, shape, or color, making them easily identifiable. Many of the earliest ballots were simply torn scraps of paper with the candidate's name scrawled on them. As paper ballots expanded, parties and individuals printed them in different colors and shapes, sometimes with wild and colorful markings or graphic imagery. Early critics recognized the problems that these ballots created: ""The moment their votes are by any marks, or color of paper, of any other distinguishing mode, to be known, you destroy this sacred right [of independent voting],"" wrote one local leader after an 1816 South Carolina election, and make elections ""the product of fear and prejudice."" At the recent contest that worried him, he charged that ""the novel, atrocious and unwarranted mode was resorted to, of voting upon green, blue, red, yellow, and a variety of colored tickets, or ballots"" with men stationed to watch voters.</p> <p>Antebellum provisions for the form of ballots were typically vague. In New York, for instance, the 1821 constitution provided only that ""All elections by the citizens shall be by ballot, except for such town officers as may by law be directed to be otherwise chosen."" In Tennessee a ballot was ""a ticket or scroll of paper, purporting to express the voter's choice, given by the voter to the officer or person holding an election, to be put into the ballot box."" Voters made many of the earliest ballots simply by tearing scraps of paper and writing out the name(s) of the candidate(s) and office(s) for which he was running. In some single-office elections and even a few more complex, multi-office elections this practice continued throughout the antebellum period. But by the middle of the antebellum period most ballots were ordered by candidates or parties, printed in partisan newspapers and then cut out by voters. This was necessitated by the increasing length of ballots due to the greater number of elective offices. It was simply becoming too difficult and time-consuming to write all the offices and one's choices on a piece of paper. But this change also opened the door for candidates and parties to print ballots that included <u>only</u> the names of friends or nominees--that, in itself, narrowed the options for many voters and reduced the their independence at the ballot box. It narrowed their options when they took pre-printed tickets <u>or</u> it made them either dependent on friends/relatives/election clerks to fill in the names they wanted. Parties used symbols, both to help identify the voter's choice as he deposited it in the box and also to help illiterate voters be sure they had the ""correct"" ballot.</p><p><a href=http://americanhistory.si.edu/vote/paperballots.html> Constitutional Union Party ticket, Virginia, 1860</a></p> <p>Party leaders tried to control the printing of ballots as much as possible, but were only partly successful. Many ballots remained ""open"" or ""hybrid,"" mixing some party nominees, usually for state offices, with county and local elections that remained nonpartisan or more fluid. These ballots often were headed with nominees for national or state offices and then just listed the office (""For County Commissioner,"" for instance) with a blank space beneath it. Each voter then had to write in the names of candidates for whom he wanted to vote, or get someone to do it for him. Many ""party"" ballots also seem to have been altered to accommodate a local candidate from another party. For instance, a Wisconsin voter in 1853 testified that ""I looked at my friends' tickets through and found they had Whig votes. I told them I thought it would be better to vote for Squire Holmes [a Democrat] as he lived in our Village . . . Most all of them said they thought the same, and gave me their tickets to scratch Adams's name out and put in Holmes's name in the place. Some times I put in given name of Squire Holmes, some times I did not. I think it was about six or eight times that I did not put in the J. E. After that we did."" Another voter remembered: ""He asked me for a Whig ticket. I told him I had one with two names stricken out, told him who they were. He said he would vote it, but did not tell me that he voted the ticket I gave him."" Most ballots were so easily identifiable that, during testimony taken in disputed elections, men routinely stated that they knew for whom others voted. As one Wisconsin voter concluded: ""I was sitting by the side of the judges when his vote was taken. I saw him give it to one of the judges, a ticket for Waugh, Williams, & Sheek, and it was put in the box.""</p><p><a href=http://cdm.bostonathenaeum.org/cdm/landingpage/collection/p16057coll29> Democratic Ticket</a></p> <p>Others seem to have taken the ballot easiest to get so they could get home. ""Mr. Nichols grabbed a ballot from one of the men standing near the polls as he hurried up, he seemed in a hurry to get it done and get home. I was not sure if he knew what ticket he grabbed."" And one Indiana voter in 1857 stated that ""I voted the printed Republican ticket; but I do not now know for whom I voted. The ticket was given to me by Mr. Pugh, who was a Republican."" He remembered that this allowed him to get home as quickly as possible, which was why he chose it. Party leaders and other supporters of particular candidates also had men on hand at the polls to hand out ballots--known as ""peddling."" One Missouri voter recalled: ""Edward McShane was distributing tickets with Chappell's name on and gave this voter about twenty such tickets and asked [me] to peddle them. McShane and I solicited voters to vote tickets with Chappell's name on them."" The pressure could be so great that voters struggled to get privacy from poll watchers. A Missouri man in 1844 testified about one voter's disputed ballot: ""When I first noticed him he was preparing a ticket to vote. Some person or persons I do not recollect who offered their assistance in making out the ticket. He refused to receive any assistance from them and remarked that he could make out his own ticket and do his own voting . . . He then moved to another position somewhere off to avoid those who were interfering with his voting and then I think finished his ticket. He wrote his ticket himself and I considered that he handed in his ticket himself.""</p> <p>Hand-written ballots and printed ballots that were altered also caused confusion and generated a lot of disputes, and yet another chance for men to manipulate the vote. They often had to be interpreted due to poor, or just indifferent spelling. These ballots gave judges great power to make a determination whether or not to count ballots spelled in different ways. One judge described this as the ""ear test,"" in which ballots were read aloud and then judges determined if they should count it--the ""intent of the voter"" was the critical factor (as in 2000). In South Carolina, in 1844, one investigating committee concluded: ""a number of the ballots were badly written and the names of the respective candidates incorrectly spelled; for instance, some of the votes for Alexander B. Stephens were spelled Elexander B. Stephens, some Elleck Stephens . . . [managers acted as best they could and] that they meted out the same measure to all the candidates; and when, from the sound or spelling of the name, they could come to the conclusion for whom the vote was given, they counted it for the individual."" So many were misspelled, in fact, ""than an investigation as to the spelling of the names upon the ballots, one half of which, perhaps were incorrectly spelled, would, if practicable, lead to no certain conclusion."" In the same case another member of the investigating committee concluded: ""The managers counted for A. B. Stephens several votes which were written E. Stevens, E. C. Stevens, E. Stephens, E. C. Stephens, R. Stevens, and H. Stevens."" (This one made worse by the presence of another candidate named Stevens (not Stephens), known in the neighborhood as ""J."") <p>Finally, the voting process also made it likely that poor men could be disenfranchised pretty easily. Election-day officials--drawn overwhelmingly from the local elite--exercised great latitude in conferring or denying the right to vote. Voters might be challenged by election judges, party operatives, agents of one or more candidates, or simply interested bystanders, on grounds of residency, wealth, age, citizenship, or race. In Tennessee, for instance, state law empowered inspectors to ask any question that they ""think material to ascertain the qualifications of the person offering to vote,"" and ""swear any by-stander as to the right and qualification of such person to vote."" These challenges were most common in close elections that hinged on a few votes. It's impossible to know with certainty how often voters were challenged or disenfranchised; we can only estimate based on surviving evid
nce collected in elections when the overall result was officially challenged. Many voters may have chosen to stay home, of course, rather than risk being called out in public--having to defend one's status as a legal voter would have been uncomfortable in front of one's neighbors.</p>  <p>Single men and those who lived with their parents often had difficulty proving their eligibility, particularly in those states that maintained property qualifications. Virginia's David Banton, in 1849, claimed to vote on land that his mother inherited, but had to defend himself as head of household. He asserted that his mother did not ""consider herself the head of the family"" and ""takes no control over with [sic] the land or crops."" More typical of disenfranchised poor white men were those who lived or worked on the margins of the community: occupations that required frequent travel such as stage drivers, peddlers, circuit riders, and teachers; itinerant farm hands; canal and ditch diggers, and railroad workers and seamen. In 1847, Alabama's Gabriel Norton, a stage driver who operated between Talladega and Benton Counties, had his vote denied because he spent several nights per week in each county. His supporters argued that he ""had his washing and mending done"" in one county (laundry was often important evidence in these cases) and ""that he kept his trunk there & spent his rest [non-working] days there. This is all the home an unmarried stage driver can have.""</p>  <p>The process revealed in these bits of testimony certainly undermines the notion of a relatively ""pure"" democracy developing in nineteenth-century America. Instead, it suggests a system made for intimidation, elite pressure, and conflicted motives for, and influences on, voting. Rather than most voters making rational choices based on party identification or policy platforms, a more plausible narrative would seem to be large numbers of voters with personal, even idiosyncratic reasons for making their political choices--when, in fact, they were allowed to make them at all, or to make them freely. The expansion of suffrage in antebellum America certainly moved the country toward greater democracy for white men. But that story was less evident or definitive than it might have been because voting wasn't secret and local elites stayed firmly in control of the process, denying or shaping the votes of poorer voters. This picture of election day also speaks to questions of partisanship and voter choice in local communities, suggesting a political culture driven much less by ideology or issues than by other factors.</p>  <p>Variable state laws and local enforcement of suffrage rights led, not surprisingly, to the intimidation, coercion, and disenfranchisement of many poor voters. In 2017, while we have removed the most obvious opportunities for intimidation and coercion because of secret ballots, a new round of state laws has revived the class discriminations so prevalent in the nineteenth century.</p><p><i>Dr. Christopher J.

6635			Civil War Treasures: Three Correspondents on the New York City Draft Riots of 1863		Rasmussen, Hans	Skaggs, Nicholas		"<p>The infamous New York City draft riots of July 13-16, 1863, remain the worst urban riots in American history.  Fomented mostly by working-class Irish immigrants and laborers of Irish descent, the insurgents were incensed over the prospect of being drafted to fight at the behest of upper-class Anglo-Protestants for the freedom of black slaves.  Resenting the exploitation and condescension of the former, and fearful the latter would compete for their unskilled jobs as freedmen, the rioters directed their rage at federal officials, Republican institutions, the affluent, and individual African Americans across Lower Manhattan over four days.  The George H. Suydam Correspondence, which recently was cataloged for the LSU Libraries Special Collections, includes three accounts of the riots.  Chiefly comprised of personal correspondence received by George H. Suydam before, during, and after his service in the US Army during the Civil War, Suydam received letters mostly from family members and friends.  While these letters chiefly concern the typical home front news of everyone's comings and goings, correspondents occasionally included news of the war, including the war on the streets of New York City.<sup>1</sup></p>  <p>George Henry Suydam (1842-1914) was born in New York City to Henry Suydam Jr. (1806-1858) and Almira (<i>née</i> Van Nostrand) Suydam (died 1868). He grew up in Newark, New Jersey, with his eight siblings, but was living and working as a clerk in Brooklyn on the eve of the Civil War.  He enlisted in Company C of the 174th New York Infantry Regiment on October 16, 1862, and was commissioned a second lieutenant.  The regiment was sent to Louisiana in December 1862, where it participated in the Siege of Port Hudson in July 1863.  George Suydam was commissioned a first lieutenant after the completion of the siege and soon after traveled to Donaldsonville as part of the relief effort at Fort Butler, where he also fought in the Battle of Kock's (or Cox's) Plantation in mid-July 1863.  The 174th New York Infantry was consolidated with the 162nd New York Infantry on February 17, 1864.  That year, Suydam's new regiment fought in the Red River Campaign, including the Battle of Sabine Cross Roads and the Battle of Pleasant Hill in April.  After retreating to Morganza in May and moving to New Orleans, the regiment then was sent to Fortress Monroe, Virginia, in July 1864.  Suydam was commissioned a captain the following August.  The regiment then participated in Philip Sheridan's Shenandoah Valley Campaign in the autumn of 1864.  The regiment had duty in Washington, D.C., from April to June 1865.  Near the end of his service, he spent time in Hawkinsville, Georgia, and then Savannah, where he was finally mustered out of service with the rest of his regiment on October 12, 1865.</p><p></p><p>The first news of the riots appeared in a letter from his sister, Mary L. Mathu, written from Brooklyn over two days on Monday and Tuesday, July 13 & 14.  Squeezed in among the usual family news, descriptions of the contents of promised care packages, and worried concern for her brother's safety, is a brief notice of the inception of the riots.  She was particularly grateful no disorder had yet erupted in Brooklyn, ""although there has been great apprehension that some disturbance would occur tonight, beginning probably at Mr. Beecher's church -- he himself you know sailed several weeks since for Europe, and I think his friends must be heartily thankful for his absence.""<sup>2</sup></p><p>George Suydam's brother, James Van Nostrand Suydam, wrote his brother from New York on July 14 and immediately launched into a vivid account of two days' disturbance.  He related stories of how rioters broke into buildings, set fires, and prevented firemen from extinguishing them.  He told how they fired and marched on ill-prepared police and soldiers, the latter being no more than ineffective, rundown invalids just returned from the war.  He complained that female rioters encouraged their men to violence and described how a soldier was beaten and stoned by the mob.  James Suydam told of how some quick thinking hotel guests on Fifth Avenue fooled the rioters by cheering them so they would move on and not attack the hotel.  He noted how Republican newspapers were in especial danger, as when the ground floor of Horace Greeley's <i>Tribune</i> was destroyed, but he took pains to describe how the office of the <i>Times</i> was protected by a Gatling gun and water-soaked paper filling the lower part of the building to retard flames.  He also wrote of brazen thefts on the street, severed telegraph wires, and broken railroad lines.  James Suydam closed with two gruesome tales, one of an unoffending black man beaten, hung from a lamppost, and his clothes set on fire, the other of Colonel Henry O'Brien ambushed and beaten at his home after fighting the mob in the streets.<sup>3</sup></p><p></p>         <p>George Suydam's sister, Adeline Suydam, writing on July 15 & 16, best conveyed the palpable fear felt in the city with a terrifying picture of the chaos on the streets.</p><blockquote>Sarah and Will Armstrong & John Franklin came out here last night.  She and Will came in his light wagon bringing their silver with them.  Neither cars nor stages were running, the stores were all shut up, and the streets filled with ugly rough looking men, and as she looked down the cross streets she could see nothing but a perfect sea of heads.  The men look each so scowlingly at them and occasionally there would be a cry of ""How are you, three hundreds?""<sup>4</sup> It is a general uprising of the poor or rather the roman catholic [sic] poor against the rich.  Last night we were better prepared for them, and to-night I hope we will be able to rake Broadway from one end to the other, if that is the only way to get rid of them.</blockquote><p>Even in her own home she worried for her safety, admitting, ""We all stayed up till about half past twelve, when Mary and I laid on the outside of her bed, until half past four when I went to my room.  This was all done secretly so that the servants who are all Roman Catholics and sympathizers with the rioters should not know it.""  Her heart went out especially to the African American victims of the mob, whose abuse riled her most furiously, declaring, ""I must say that their scandalous treatment of the negroes has made me feel as if I should like to see them fairly mowed down with grape shot.""<sup>5</sup></p> <p>In the end, Adeline Suydam got her wish.  Reinforcements from the army did indeed put down the mob with all due force, such that most of the 120 or so dead over the four stormy days were rioters.</p><p>_______________</p><p><sup>1</sup> George H.

6471	9781606352700/9780813166940	$34.95/$50.00	Southern Manhood at the Margins		Beilein, Joseph M., Jr.	Lussana, Sergio A		"<p>The study of southern masculinity is robust, with historians examining diverse groups of men beyond the planter class that jumpstarted the field. These two works feature men at the South's physical and cultural margins. Joseph M. Beilein Jr.'s work on Missouri guerillas depicts men who, although the sons of the planter class and adherents to gentry standards of white southern manhood, operated on the edges of conventional warfare and in the liminal landscape of the brush. Sergio A. Lussana, meanwhile, investigates friendship among enslaved men, a group officially denied the prerogatives of household mastery, a prerequisite of white southern manhood. Yet enslaved men created their own masculinity on the periphery, in exclusively male physical and cultural spaces outside the ken of white southerners. That both groups still drew from overarching norms of southern manhood underscores the malleability of that concept and raises questions about the historical utility of encompassing notions of southern masculinity.</p> <p><b>Guerilla Manhood</b></p> <p>Guerillas need not be inaccessible or ahistorical evildoers, contends Joseph M. Beilein Jr. In <i>Bushwhackers: Guerilla Warfare, Manhood, and the Household in Civil War Missouri</i>, Beilein makes guerillas understandable as southern men by recreating how they understood themselves as southern men. Beilein situates these men in the familiar southern plantation household, which, in his analysis, was both a physical space and cultural construct. Guerillas' wartime actions grew out of their household roles. Enmeshed in this domestic context, Missouri's guerillas become historically fathomable, even as their conception of their household duties countenanced atrocities in the irregular world of the brush.</p> 	<p>Placing guerillas within the patriarchal household imbues their actions with meaning. Even in the brush, unmoored from the physical household, guerillas were performing responsibilities conditioned by the household's dependent relationships and mutual obligations. These men were the sons of the Missouri gentry. Unlike many conventional soldiers, they became guerillas because their physical households were invaded, their patriarchs dethroned. These patriarchs-in-waiting thus approached the Civil War as a ""household war,"" in which the battlefield was the household and the enemy were other heads-of-household. They fought not for Confederate nationalism, but for kin and the domestic hierarchies that structured their prewar lives. The immediacy of the war in Missouri, with its violent incursions into the home, grew out of this perception that the household order was under siege.</p>	<p>The household functions in sophisticated ways in this book, as both a physical site <i>and</i> a cultural construct transferrable to the brush. To uncover its physical dimension and prove that Missouri's Civil War was literally a war among households, Beilein uses demographic data to spatially map the kinship networks and household locations that comprised guerilla bands. These bands utilized households as physical sites of resistance and logistical support, and Beilein provides statistics on households' productive capacities and ability to wage war. Kinship anchored guerilla bands such as the Fristoe and Holtzclaw networks, which could include fictive kin, such as notorious guerilla leader William Quantrill. Women, moreover, played a crucial role in the logistical networks of household production and deserve the guerilla designation.</p>	<p>Yet male guerillas spent much of their time away from women and their homes, engaging in irregular warfare in the brush. Here, Beilein focuses on the household as a cultural construct which guerillas carried with them, imbuing the brush and its violence with meaning. Beilein relies on guerillas' own words and creative readings of their material culture to explain how they envisaged the brush as an extension of the household. These men were not atomized agents in a male homosocial space. Women were always present, because men entered the brush to preserve the domestic relationships which defined their manhood. They also regularly returned to homes that doubled as supply depots. The familiar southern household, long treated by historians as an ideology or aspiration in addition to a physical entity, becomes more elastic in this work, accounting for guerillas' seamless movement between their homes and the brush.</p><p>Beilein's work sparkles in its cultural analysis. He interprets guerilla material culture, including their dress and trophies, such as scalps, as expressive of their relational, masculine identities. Through rich description, Beilein grounds abstract masculine ideals in physical artifacts and the guerilla body, underscoring that guerilla manhood was performative. Thematic chapters on guerilla foodways, horses, and weaponry are innovative and engrossing. The chapter on ""rebel style"" is rigorous in its presentation of the guerilla shirt -- colorful, individualized garments made by guerilla women. Wearing these shirts, guerillas carried their households into the brush and embodied the patriarchal domestic order for which they fought. A strength of the work is the synthesis of cultural with military history. Horses and pistols may have conveyed guerilla identity, but they were also tactically and strategically sound. The guerilla style was more than flourish -- it was militarily effective.</p> <p>Beilein colorfully portrays guerilla culture and bases it in a physical world of household production, slaveholding, and violence. With rigorous statistics and appendices, Beilein tells us who the guerillas were as individuals and families. He then uses memoirs and his own careful reading of their bodies, objects, and actions to tell us how they understood themselves. The combination of the material foundations of guerilla warfare with an appreciation of the guerilla aesthetic makes for a compelling and holistic account of men who otherwise defy classification. Beilein ultimately explains how these men, differing from most other Confederates, still went to war to defend their antebellum households. By adapting antebellum culture to the exigencies of war, ""they created a paradigm of masculinity that worked for them"" (166). Where readers might wonder why more of the South's young gentry did not end up scalping enemies, Beilein answers that Missouri's intimate household war prompted these men, although like other Confederates in their commitment to the antebellum racial and gender order, to take white southern manhood in a frightening new direction.</p> <p><b>Enslaved Manhood</b></p></br> <p>Where Beilein positions the household as central to guerilla manhood, Sergio A. Lussana explores masculinity's development in homosocial settings. In <i>My Brother Slaves: Friendship, Masculinity, and Resistance in the Antebellum South</i>, Lussana recounts how enslaved southerners cultivated manhood before audiences of fellow men. Enslaved men were formally barred from household mastery and were regarded by white southerners as domestic dependents. For Lussana, their identities as men derived from their relationships with other men, not from their roles as husbands and fathers. Men formed homosocial bonds at the physical and cultural margins of plantation life. With each other's support, they reinterpreted plantation space, moved transgressively through southern landscapes, and laid claim to their bodies, all of which constituted acts of enslaved politics and everyday resistance.</p><p>Lussana predicates his discussion of enslaved male culture on sex-segregated spaces and labor regimes. Enslaved men generally worked with other men, whether in male work gangs or in all-male locales, such as camps in North Carolina's pine forests. After mapping out sex-segregated labor practices across economic sectors, much of Lussana's subsequent analysis prioritizes plantation laborers, inviting other scholars to investigate enslaved male subcultures in urban areas and industries like mining. In addition to sex-segregated labor regimes, moreover, many men married off-plantation. The physical separation of men and women, husbands and wives, gave rise to separate cultural spaces in which a man's gender identity coalesced, not through interaction with women, but among other men. Lussana prioritizes men's homosocial bonds over their roles as domestic protectors and providers as determinants of their masculinity.</p> <p>The plantation offered cultural in addition to physical space in which men solidified friendships and ratified each other's manhood. Men assessed each other through public performance and leisure. Many of these activities, like their labor, were exclusively male. They drank, gambled, wrestled, practiced craft skills, evaded slave patrols, and hunted. The estimation of peers sanctioned hierarchies and leadership among them. Like Missouri's white guerillas, enslaved men nurtured their masculinity in marginal spaces. They gathered as friends in the woods, often nocturnally, and flouted slaveholders' spatial and temporal strictures together on forays to other plantations, transmitting information and stolen goods. Surreptitious movement through ""illicit space"" (71) and control over their own bodies were key components of masculinity. Mobility was gendered male among slaves. Lussana relies on enslaved testimony such as slave narratives and WPA interviews to uncover how men understood their bonds with one another. In addition, he carefully makes use of white-authored sources, especially court records and plantation rules, as inverse evidence of transgressive slave activities. White complaints of black criminality were a recognition of black political agency facilitated by male social bonds.</p> 	<p>Enslaved men cultivated political agency in addition to masculine identity in these spaces. Marginal spaces were politicized, and the ""masculine body"" became a ""a site of direct resistance to white oppression"" (63). Building on scholarship that locates enslaved resistance in performance, the body, material culture, and fashion, Lussana employs an expansive definition of politics. Cross-plantation networks of masculine solidarity served as the springboard for overt politics. Friendships fostered communication networks like the grapevine telegraph to disseminate political news, men helped each other along the Underground Railroad, and male artisanal culture provided the physical and ideological space for plotting insurrection and escape. But friendly bouts of drinking and wrestling also qualified as resistance. The bodily control connoted by such acts was a means of asserting self-ownership and flouting the chattel principle. Resistance was also the everyday interactions among men.</p> 	<p>Enslaved men pulled from multiple sources to construct their manhood. Lussana cites folklore and anthropological studies of West African friendship as evidence of the influence of African heritage. Enslaved men's intense bonds, furthermore, were akin to the romantic friendships characteristic of antebellum American culture more broadly. Gambling, drinking, hunting, and physical self-assertion were also distinctly southern tenets of manhood, common to white and black men. Enslaved men, like southern white men, were expected to exhibit honor and let the community scrutinize their manhood. The intriguing argument in favor of a hybrid manhood derived from West African and white southern traditions should spur further study.</p> <p><b>""Southern"" Manhood</b></p><p>These works, considered together, can be taken to suggest the existence of an overarching paradigm of southern manhood, to which all men, black and white, free and enslaved, subscribed, even as they repurposed it for their own ends. Both Beilein and Lussana note that southern men were expected to publicly perform the rituals of honor culture and prove themselves through undertakings like hunting and feats of physical strength. Is there more to southern manhood? Some historians point to household mastery alongside honor. Beilein's work testifies to the household's resonance among guerillas. Lussana, however, challenges the plantation household's historiographical hold by showing that enslaved manhood matured in homosocial spaces. Scholarship has long held that the patriarchal household became an aspiration for freedmen after emancipation, with African American men legally marrying, regulating the labor of household dependents, and physically removing families beyond white supervision. Lussana's account undermines the antebellum foundations of postbellum black patriarchy. His study of black men complements scholarship which finds that formerly enslaved women did not submit to white models of patriarchal domesticity and instead envisioned a variety of domestic arrangements as they reconstituted families sundered by slavery and war.</p> <p>Even if black men did not covet household mastery as a signifier of manhood, Lussana still contends that they borrowed from a shared southern culture by drinking, hunting, and wrestling. What are the implications of African American men working within the white South's conception of masculinity, when white southern manhood was predicated on racial mastery? Lussana emphasizes that enslaved men simultaneously hearkened back to their West African heritage, resulting in a composite manhood, but the problem of ""southern manhood"" serving as a basis for enslaved resistance remains. The fraught applicability of southern manhood to both black and white men is only one example of how these works can prompt historians to challenge the utility of any gender ideology generalizable enough to shape the identities and actions of all southern men.</p> <p>A related question concerns men and women's ability to articulate alternatives to culturally determined gender roles. Although men on the South's physical and cultural peripheries constructed their own masculinity, prevailing notions of ""southern manhood"" still seem deterministic at times. Beilein argues that guerillas crafted unique identities, concluding, ""the ghosts of the guerillas remind us that we have the ability to choose what kind of men and women we will become"" (194). Beilein's guerillas, nonetheless, occasionally abdicated their agency in adherence to cultural scripts. They gunned down African American soldiers because, ""in their minds, the guerillas had no other option"" (181). Similarly, scalping appears as a logical, albeit ghastly, outgrowth of antebellum hunting culture.</p> <p>As historians examine more diverse subsets of southern men, they can ask whether they worked within a regional consensus regarding what made a southern man or whether they looked elsewhere to reinforce their masculinity. While calling into question a hegemonic southern manhood, these works also recommend ways of defining manhood without recourse to the historiographical stalwarts of honor and mastery. Guerillas and enslaved men performed their gender, doing so by controlling their landscape, their mobility, and their bodies. Both groups of men retreated to the margins, with guerillas operating in the brush and African Americans moving outside the gaze of white southerners and the plantation household. These men also mastered their own bodies, establishing their physical selves as politicized sites of resistance. Beilein, for instance, draws on queer theory to tantalize readers with the observation that reconnoitering guerillas wore blue to ""pass"" as Union soldiers and even cross-dressed. Both authors thereby provide criteria for manhood in the South beyond overdetermined honor rituals or household mastery in their attention to manly control over space, mobility, and bodies. But is this basis for manhood distinctly southern?</p><p><i>Joshua A.

6473			Civil War Treasures:  The Civil War and Reconstruction in a Shakespearean Idiom		Rasmussen, Hans			"<p>The works and words of William Shakespeare were a common cultural presence in both Great Britain and the United States throughout the nineteenth century, providing a means for both nations to comprehend a variety of national issues.  His influence crossed all social classes through theater performances both refined and burlesque, more readily available editions of his works, art and music inspired by his plays, myriad literary allusions, the required reading of formal schooling, political discourse, and other common cultural references.  English political caricatures and cartoons began employing Shakespearean themes in the eighteenth century as the Bard became firmly established as an unassailable national institution in Britain, and he would persist as a familiar subject in periodicals both highbrow and lower-class during the subsequent century.  As Kathryn Prince has observed, ""The periodicals of the nineteenth century initiated and propagated the habit of using Shakespeare to frame current events and thus to shape understanding.""<sup>1</sup></p>    <p>This installment of Civil War Treasures considers a sampling of political cartoons from both sides of the Atlantic that looked to William Shakespeare's plays to explain issues in the American Civil War and Reconstruction.  <i>Punch, or the London Charivari</i>, the famous British weekly satirical magazine established in 1841, had become a truly national institution by the time the American Civil War began and sometimes published cartoons on the war to join the many Shakespeare-themed contributions in its pages. <sup>2</sup>  <i>Harper's Weekly: A Journal of Civilization</i> is undoubtedly familiar and endearing to Civil War and Reconstruction historians both for its extensive coverage of the war and the ingenious cartooning of Thomas Nast, who drew for the periodical between 1862 and 1886.  The LSU Libraries Special Collections holds original issues of both <i>Punch</i> and <i>Harper's Weekly</i> for the years of the Civil War and Reconstruction.</p>   <p>A cartoon published early in the war on April 5, 1862, illustrated the general North-South dispute over slavery through the quarrel of Oberon and Titania from <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i>.  In act 2, scene 1, Titania rebuffs Oberon's demand for possession of her Indian changeling boy, the son of her deceased votaress.  Here Abraham Lincoln (portrayed as Oberon) and Titania (representing the state of Virginia), both with wings colored in their national flags, deliver slightly modified lines.  The American Oberon asks, ""I do but beg a little <b>nigger</b> boy, to be my henchman,"" only to be sternly refused by the Confederate Titania firmly clutching the hand of her child slave, ""Set your heart at rest, the <b>northern</b> land buys not the child of me.""<sup>3</sup></p><p><i>Punch</i> had included images of slaves in cartoons inspired by <i>Othello</i> and <i>The Tempest</i>, but the dilemma of determining the role of freedmen in the United States was the subject of an August 15, 1863, cartoon based on the famous scene of the apparition of Caesar's ghost in act 4, scene 3 of <i>Julius Caesar</i>.  Set in Brutus' tent the night before the Battle of Philippi, Brutus reads a book while his attendant Lucius plays music for him.  All are drowsy, so Lucius, Varro, and Claudius fall asleep, leaving only Brutus awake to see Caesar's ghost tell him he will see Brutus again when he perishes at Philippi.  In the cartoon, Lucius is portrayed as a young, naïve black minstrel fast asleep with his banjo beside him, while the ghost of a stern-faced freedman reminds President Lincoln in exaggerated negro dialect, ""I am dy ebil genus, massa LINKING.  Dis child am awful Inimpressional.""  Lincoln is pictured reading a copy of <i>Joe Miller's Jests</i>, a popular joke book first published in 1739 and reprinted in numerous editions -- a jab at Lincoln's famous sense of humor that will do him no good when deciding how to deal with this new class of Americans whom he has created by proclamation.<sup>4</sup>  Incidentally, Lincoln's humor was subjected to ridicule again in another Shakespearean cartoon published during the 1864 election that portrayed George McClellan as Hamlet holding the president's head in the place of Yorick's skull, reciting from act 4, scene 1: ""I knew him, Horatio; a fellow of infinite jest . . . where be your gibes now?""</p><p>The postwar <i>Alabama</i> claims inspired a pair of dueling political cartoons between <i>Punch</i> and <i>Harper's Weekly</i> in the late spring of 1869.  The English took the first shot on May 29 with a cartoon drawing on an exchange between Jack Falstaff and Prince Hal in the Boar's Head Tavern in act 3, scene 3 of <i>Henry IV Part 1</i>, where Falstaff bemoans his impecunious state and finds his rash words come back to haunt him: </p>  <p><b>PRINCE HENRY</b>: Thou sayest true, hostess; and he slanders thee most grossly.</p>  <p><b>MISTRESS QUICKLY</b>: So he doth you, my lord; and said this other day you ought him a thousand pound.</p>  <p><b>PRINCE HENRY</b>: Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?</p>  <p><b>FALSTAFF</b>: A thousand pound, Ha! a million: thy love is worth a million: thou owest me thy love.</p>    Here the American ""Sir Jonathan Falstaff"" raises the sum to four hundred million, an outrageous amount demanded of the English for their role in abetting Confederate depredations on the high seas.  Thomas Nast struck back a month later with a parodying <a href=http://staging.thomasnast.com/asp/ViewArticleText.asp?url=content%3A%2F%2Fharpweek%2Ftitle%5BHW%5D%2Fvolume%5B1869%5D%2Fissue%5B0626%5D%23%2FTEI%2E2%5B1%5D%2Ftext%5B1%5D%2Fbody%5B1%5D%2Fdiv1%5B29%5D%2Fp%5B4%5D%2Ffigure%5B2%5D&pageIDs=%7CHW%2D1869%2D06%2D26%2D0413%7C&title=&returnUrl=%2E%2E%2FActivities%2FNastandShakespeare%2FHubPages%2FCommentaryPage%2Easp%3FCommentary%3D03Indexes%2D01Play&returnTitle=Index+by+Play> cartoon</a> published alongside the reprinted <i>Punch</i> creation.  He quoted directly another tavern exchange between the two from act 2, scene 4: ""Here comes lean Jack, here comes bare-bone.  How now, my sweet creature of bombast!  How long is't ago, Jack, since thou sawest thine own knee?""  Now a huge-bellied ""Sir John Bull Falstaff"" is featured with ""fair play"" and ""honest neutrality"" written on his knees, concepts he seems unable to see with his eyes or observe in his actions.  A copy of ""Sumner speech"" is mashed angrily in his hand, an allusion to the April 13, 1869, speech by Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, demanding $2 billion in damages, or alternatively, the ceding of Canada to the United States. <sup>5</sup></p>   <p>Nast loved to use Shakespearean allusions in his political cartoons, including those supporting Republican aims on Reconstruction.  One amusing example borrowed from <i>Othello</i> to imagine the humiliation of Jefferson Davis.  Nast's <a href=http://staging.thomasnast.com/asp/ViewArticleText.asp?url=content%3A%2F%2Fharpweek%2Ftitle%5BHW%5D%2Fvolume%5B1870%5D%2Fissue%5B0409%5D%23%2FTEI%2E2%5B1%5D%2Ftext%5B1%5D%2Fbody%5B1%5D%2Fdiv1%5B21%5D%2Fdiv2%5B1%5D%2Fp%5B1%5D%2Ffigure%5B1%5D&pageIDs=%7CHW%2D1870%2D04%2D09%2D0232%7C&title=&returnUrl=%2E%2E%2FActivities%2FNastandShakespeare%2FHubPages%2FCommentaryPage%2Easp%3FCommentary%3D03Indexes%2D01Play&returnTitle=Index+by+Play> April 9, 1870, cartoon</a> for <i>Harper's Weekly</i> portrays Davis as a seething Iago casting a bitter backwards glance at Hiram Revels, who in 1870 became the first African American to serve in Congress, ironically by taking the same Senate seat for Mississippi that Davis had resigned in 1861.

6636			Editorial: Winter 2018		Barber, Tom			<p>This issue military history, its tactics and its combatants, organizes our featured reviews. Benjamin F. Cooling reviews Gordon Rhea's <i>On to Petersburg: Grant and Lee, June 4-15, 1864</i>. Cooling finds Rhea's book important for highlighting how Grant adapted to warfare on the Union's eastern front. Covering the same period, but with different aims is Steven E. Sodergren's <i>The Army of the Potomac in the Overland and Petersburg Campaigns: Union Soldiers and Trench Warfare, 1864-1865</i> reviewed by Charles Bowery. Here Sodergren examines how trench warfare impacted the morale of Union forces in the east.  Turning from east to west is Thomas W. Cutrer's <i>Theater of a Separate War: The Civil War West of the Mississippi River, 1861-1865</i>. Reviewers John T. Becker and Robert Welch consider Cutrer's work an important survey of the western theater, but also a flawed book for its uneven coverage and editorial oversights. Our final review focuses on the conflict's deaf participants. Sarah Handley-Cousins recommends Harry G. Lang's <i>Fighting in the Shadows: Untold Stories of Deaf People in the Civil War</i> for its expansive survey of how deafness shaped individual outlooks, reform movements, military struggles, and national policies.</p><p>In our author interview Jimmy L. Bryan Jr. discusses his latest book <i>The American Elsewhere: Adventure and Manliness in the Age of Expansion</i>. In the interview we discuss how literature about lands west of the Mississippi imprinted race and masculinity on the politics of territorial expansion.</p><p>Frank Williams returns with his quarterly column: Look at Lincoln. This issue he reviews Walter Stahr's <i>Stanton: Lincoln's War Secretary</i>. Williams considers the book a useful corrective to the conventional wisdom that regularly deprives Stanton's actions of their original context in order to caricaturize him as an autocrat.</p> <p>Finishing out our ongoing series about the poor, white electorate before and after the Civil War is an essay from Michael Fitzgerald, author of <i>Reconstruction in Alabama</i> (reviewed recently by the CWBR here.</p><p>Civil War Treasures returns this issue with eyewitness descriptions of New York's 1863 draft riots. LSU Special Collections librarians Han Rasmussen and Nickolas Skaggs describe the correspondence of George H. Suydam, a second lieutenant stationed in New Orleans, who received several accounts of the riots from family living in New York.</p><p>This issue also introduces Civil War Obscura, a new column by writer Meg Groeling. In this column Meg focuses on popular, but lesser known books of the Civil War era. No printed text is off limits; fiction, non-fiction, personal memoirs, and virtually all other printed materials are all welcome here. She begins this project with a look at Henry Villard's <i>Lincoln on the Eve of '61</i>. The purpose of this column, we hope, is to introduce both lay readers, independent scholars, and academics to historical voices beyond their usual interests or specializations. In doing so, we hope to create and encourage more conversation between these communities.</p><p>Finally, the <i>CWBR</i> is a communal project sustained through generous donations of time and energy.

6422			Editorial: Expanding the Frame of Reference		Barber, Tom			"<p>Welcome to our Winter 2017 issue of the <i>CWBR</i>. This issue's feature content includes a diverse offering that ranges from the lives of women in antebellum of Natchez, Mississippi to military engineering. Though diverse, this issue's offerings challenge the reader to look beyond the conventional frames of historical reference by closely examining the lives of non-elite women, the culture behind military logistics, the global exchange of ideas, and the morality of nineteenth-century decisions makers.</p>   <p>Mark Smith's review of Thomas F. Army Jr.'s <i>Engineering Victory: How Technology Won the Civil War</i> praises the book for its examination of a ""culture of improvisation"" that saturated the North. The antebellum North's commitment to common school reforms and embrace of the lyceum movement, Army argues, made the Union army amiable to a system of ""bottom-up technical innovations,"" which proved essential to the Union's victory.</p>  <p>In Joyce Broussard's <i>Stepping Lively in Place: The Not-Married, Free Women of Civil-War-Era Natchez, Mississippi</i> our issue turns from the cultural concerns to social considerations. As reviewer Jean Baker points out, society expected Natchez's unmarried, free women to be dutiful wives above all else. These expectations meant that unmarried women, black or white, needed to operate ""with amazing dexterity"" if they intended to remain unmarried property holders before and after the Civil War.</p>  <p>Our Civil War Treasures column considers the rich documentary sources left by one antebellum family from Clinton, Louisiana. The Wall Family Papers, as LSU special collection librarians Hans Rasmussen and Meghann Wollitz explain, feature vivid commentary by a southeast Louisiana family who experienced heavy wartime losses, imprisonment, and maintained familial responsibilities under military occupation.</p>  <p>Further expanding the boundaries of historical convention is Vitor Izechkson's <i>Slavery and War in the Americas: Race, Citizenship, and State Building in the United States and Brazil, 1861-1870</i>. Though a number of scholars have previously examined connections between the U.S. and Brazil, reviewer Enrico Dal Lago notes, Izechkson's analysis is path breaking for its chronological emphasis. Few scholars have devoted book length studies to the western hemisphere's dominant slave powers. In closely comparing these slaveholding powers in wartime, Izechson turns conventional wisdom on its head by recognizing that the American Civil War wrought incredible social change through emancipation and the Confederacy's defeat. Brazil's War of the Triple Alliance, however, brought no such changes for that country's enslaved. These conclusions, Dal Lago points out, enable to Izechson to convincingly paint the American Civil War as a total war because of the social changes it wrought.</p>    <p>Brazil, slavery, and war all appear in Matthew Karp's <i>This Vast Slaveholding Empire: Slaveholders at the Helm of American Foreign Policy</i>. In my interview with Dr. Karp we discuss how U.S. slaveholders secured their interests in human property through their long command over U.S. foreign policy.  Threatened by Britain's anti-slavery policy, U.S. slaveholders looked beyond their nation's border to secure and justify slavery. American slaveholders found scholarly and political justifications for slavery through close engagement with Europe's intellectuals and that continent's growing use of colonial labor. As Dr. William J. Cooper, who reviews <i>This Vast Southern Empire</i> this issue, finds that one of the book's most important features is its convincing portrait of slaveholders as cosmopolitan, but conservative men who preferred foreign policy to filibustering.</p>   <p>Our resident Lincoln expert, Frank J. Williams, tackles Thomas L. Carson's <i>Lincoln's Ethics</i>. As Mr. Williams makes clear, Carson's background as a philosopher and expert on moral relativism is the book's cardinal virtue. Carson's professional background infuses familiar debates about Lincoln's thoughts on slavery and race with new energy.</p>  <p>Inspired by a panel (titled: The Perennial Problem of Poor Whites during the Civil War Era) at the 2016 Southern Historical Association's conference, and the lively discussion that followed, this issue begins a new, and hopefully ongoing series, about poor southern whites in the generations before and after the Civil War. Gary Edwards begins this series with an essay about the political identity of poor whites during Reconstruction.</p>"		Winter 2017	2017-2-1	Editorial					Front_Center			"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=79 alt=\""Product Cover\"" border=0 src=\""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/BCivilWar.jpg\"">"							
6530			Editorial: Summer 2017		Barber, Tom			<p>Welcome to the <i>Civil War Book Review</i>'s Summer 2017 issue.</p><p>With its bright colors and neat lines, George Caleb Bingham's <i>Election Series</i> paintings (<i>Verdict of the People</i>, 1854, pictured above) reminds its viewers that American democracy before the Civil War was both vibrant, and chaotic. Taking its cue from Bingham, this issue's featured content considers books that demonstrate history's idiosyncratic nature by broad reappraisal of now familiar topics, such as the memory of Reconstruction and public censorship.</p> <p>Gaines Foster reviews <i>Remembering Reconstruction: Struggles Over the Meaning of America's Most Turbulent Era</i>, a collection of essays edited by Carole Emberton and Bruce E. Baker. Foster finds the collection valuable for its attempt to understand both how Americans remembered Reconstruction and why they let its memory languish today.</p>  <p>Anne Marshall reviews Catherine Clinton's <i>Step-Daughters of History: Southern Women and the American Civil War</i>. Originally produced for Louisiana State University's Walter L. Fleming lecture series in 2012, the book's essays assess how women's lives became central to understanding of the Civil War era by looking at the actions of women who flouted the period's cultural norms, conformed to its values, or became its most infamous stereotypes.</p><p>Reassessment of the familiar continues in Mark E. Neely's <i>Lincoln and the Democrats: The Politics of Opposition</i>. Reviewer Barry Alfonso considers Neely's book important because it challenges our perceptions of northern Democrats by examining how they aided the Union war effort, rather than focusing on their vocal disagreements with Lincoln and the Republicans.</p> <p>Last, but certainly not least, Jeffery Hobson reviews the second edition of Dewey Grantham's important work <i>Southern Progressivism: The Reconciliation of Progress and Tradition</i>. More than a review of a familiar text, Hobson contextualizes <i>Southern Progressivism</i> beside the research inspired by the original.

6583			Editorial: Fall 2017		Barber, Tom			"<p>Welcome to the <i>CWBR</i>'s Fall 2017 issue. This issue covers a range of topics that include family in antebellum America, U.S. Grant's life, and slavery. Though these subjects receive regular attention in some capacity, many of the works reviewed highlight often neglected aspects of  familiar topics.</p> <p>Two of our feature reviews examine the people and institutions that perpetuated slavery before the Civil War. Charles B. Dew finds Hank Trent's <i>The Secret Life of Bacon Tait, a White Slave Trader Married to a Free Woman of Color</i> an especially valuable contribution for its ground-level analysis of Richmond, Virginia's slave-trading enterprises. Born in 1796, Taint participated in, and profited from,  slavery's expansion; a growth that Trent suggests led to Tait's informal marriage to Courtney Fountain, a freed woman of color living near the slave trader in Richmond.</p> <p>Moving beyond individual lives, Katherine Mooney reviews Jennifer Oast's <i>Institutional Slavery: Slaveholding Churches, Schools, Colleges, and Businesses in Virginia, 1680-1860</i>. Oast's work yields fresh insights into how Virginia's leaders tethered educational philanthropy to enslaved labor. In doing so, Mooney commends the book for its convincing portrayal of how ""slavery dictated relationships of every degree of power and intimacy.""</p> <p>Our third and fourth featured reviews also confront neglected, but essential, subjects. Catherine Jones praises Dawn Peterson's <i>Indians in the Family: Adoption and the Politics of Antebellum Expansion</i> for its seamless integration of household organization and the history of empire. As an act that reconfigured households, adoption enabled indigenous leaders and parents to adapt to white encroachment through kinship ties, while white leaders such as Andrew Jackson used adoption to soften his personal and political image.</p> <p>Mark A. Neels' review of Stephen Engle's <i>Gathering to Save a Nation: Lincoln & the Union's War Governors</i> turns our attention from understudied private households to neglected aspects of Union leadership during national crisis. Looking closely at efforts to mobilize the nation's resources, Engle argues that the dynamic between Lincoln and the Union Governors reflected collaborative relationship, not top-down leadership. As the first comprehensive study of the Union's wartime governors relationship with Lincoln in almost seventy years, Neels considers the book a much needed update.</p> <p>For our feature column, Daniel W. Crofts reviews Edward L. Ayers' latest work <i>The Thin Light of Freedom: Civil War and Emancipation in the Heart of America</i>, a follow-up of Ayers' 2004 book <i>In the Presence of Mine Enemies: The Civil War in the Heart of America, 1859-1864</i>. In addition to being well-crafted, Crofts' essay deserves a special attention because his essay acts as part refresher and part review, an important element for those of us who missed <i>In the Presence of Mine Enemies</i>.</p><p>This issue I interview Matthew Stanley about his new book <i>The Loyal West: Civil War and Reunion in Middle America</i>. By carefully following the region's political culture from the antebellum era to the early twentieth century, this work enriches our understanding of how Middle America's postwar commemorative ceremonies anticipated, and influenced, national reconciliation efforts.</p>  <p>Putting all things Lincoln aside for a moment, Frank Williams reviews Ron Chernow's <i>Grant</i>. Fusing historical nuance with lively prose, Williams considers Chernow's work a welcome and much needed addition to the historical literature about Grant.</p>    <p>Finally, do not miss the latest edition of Civil War Treasures, our regular column dedicated to exploring Hill Memorial Library's collection of Civil War and Reconstruction era archival materials. In this issue, Hans Rasmussen shares an encrypted letter from George Blake, a disgruntled sergeant in Company H of the 18th New York Infantry Regiment.</p> <p>As always, I'd like to thank all of our contributors who donated their time to craft the thoughtful reviews and essays that fill this issue's digital pages.</p>   <p>Tom Barber, Editor</p>"		Fall 2017	2017-11-1	Editorial					Front_Center			"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=210 alt=\""Product Cover\"" border=0 src=\""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/grantbig.jpg\"">"							
6474			Editorial: Spring 2017		Barber, Tom			"<p>Welcome to the CWBR's Spring 2017 issue. This issue's feature reviews cover a wide range of topics that include the Atlantic slave trade, New England Brahmins, prison escapes, and popular memory.</p> <p>William Wagner reviews Kanisorn Wongsrichanalai's <i>Northern Character: College-Educated New Englanders, Honor, Nationalism, and Leadership in the Civil War Era</i>. Wagner praises the book for its detailed description of honor among the young New Englanders who joined the Union Army. Steeped in notions of self-control, self-sacrifice, and independent thought, New Englanders joined the war effort to secure a worldview that valued free labor and social distinction, an ideology that could be both politically radical, but socially conservative. An explanation that Wagner highlights as a reason why formally educated New Englanders joined as officers, fought against slavery, but later lost interest in the project of Reconstruction.</p><p>Lorien Foote's <i>Yankee Plague: Escaped Union Prisoners and the Collapse of the Confederacy</i> follows the exploits of the Union soldiers who flooded the Confederate backcountry in the war's waning months. Union escapees did not cause the Confederacy's collapse, Foote argues. Instead escapees functioned as heralds of the Confederacy\'s downfall. In following these stories, reviewer James Marten views Foote's work as essential because the book demonstrates just how the Confederacy unraveled in its last months.</p><p>Peter Wood reviews Sowande' M. Mustakeem's <i>Slavery at Sea: Terror, Sex, and Sickness in the Middle Passage</i>. Wood asserts that Mustakeem's work recovers not only the grim details of the middle passage, but also convincingly demonstrates how the ""massive prevalence of death"" affected the actions and thinking of those who survived the passage. In doing so, Wood concludes, the book adds to a growing historical literature that refuses to define the Atlantic slave trade by national boundaries.</p><p>Bradley Keefer reviews Matthew C. Hulbert's <i>The Ghosts of Guerilla Memory: How Civil War Bushwhackers Became Gunslingers in the American West</i>. Hulbert argues that the memory of Confederate guerillas remained influential long after their battles on the Confederacy's geographical margins. Confederate apologists, northern critics, and Hollywood writers, as Keefer notes, appropriated guerilla memory to expand the Lost Cause, chastise the South, and later as context for the outlaw heroes that defined American westerns in the 1940s. </p><p>Our feature column hosts a double review of Joseph M. Beilein Jr.'s <i>Bushwhackers: Guerilla Warfare, Manhood, and the Household in the Civil War Missouri</i> and Sergio A. Lussana's <i>My Brother Slaves: Friendship, Masculinity, and Resistance in the Antebellum South</i> by Joshua Lynn. Freedom and enslavement, created two very different foundations for masculinity. For Beilein, the Missouri guerillas' war time actions grew out of their roles as household patriarchs, and the social hierarchies that made southern plantation household possible. Denied traditional markers of nineteenth-century manhood often associated with property holding, and often segregated by sex, masculinity for enslaved black men occurred in same sex social environments. Friendships among enslaved men developed in the context of labor and resistance to plantation rules. In spite of these differences, however, Lynn suggests that important continuities existed. Black and white southern men acknowledged manhood in public displays that ranged from hunting to feats of strength. </p> <p>Drawing on the Civil War Era's most popular magazines (<i>Punch</i> and <i>Harper's Weekly</i>), LSU Special Collections librarian Hans Rasmussen explains how Shakespearian idiom framed the Civil War and Reconstruction. </p> <p>In this issue's Look at Lincoln, Frank Williams reviews Sidney Blumenthal's, <i>Wrestling with his Angel: The Political Life of Abraham Lincoln, Volume 2, 1849-1856</i>. Williams finds Blumenthal's second volume a worthy investigation of how Lincoln's moral beliefs led to his break from the Whig Party and convinced him to join the Republican Party. </p> <p>This issue's interview features Douglas Egerton, author of the prize winning <i>Thunder at the Gates: The Black Civil War Regiments that Redeemed America</i>. In the interview, Professor Egerton explains how the performance of these individuals units reshaped the Union's war effort through individual valor, personal hardship, and political activism.</p>  <p>Thank you for reading and contributing.

6421			Civil War Treasures:  The Civil War Saga of the Wall Family of Clinton, Louisiana		Rasmussen, Hans C.	Wollitz, Meghann		"<p>While it might be peculiar to describe a collection of antebellum, Civil War, and postbellum letters as ""new,"" such an odd characterization would not be unreasonable for the Wall Family Papers in the LSU Libraries Special Collections.  Acquired at auction last October, the papers are comprised of 54 letters exchanged among the members of the family of Isaac and Mary Wall of Clinton, Louisiana, between 1829 and 1921.  They have been cataloged only recently and are now available to researchers for the first time.  Among other family events spread over nearly a century, they vividly document the woes of a woman in southeast Louisiana who gave a brother and four sons to the Confederate army, ultimately losing three of the five.</p>  <p>Mary Susannah Winans Wall (1816-1897), originally of Wilkinson County, Mississippi, was the daughter of Martha DuBose and William Winans, a bishop in the Methodist Episcopal Church and founder of one of the earliest such congregations in Louisiana.  She married Isaac Wall (1798-1872) on January 15, 1834.  Isaac was educated in his home state of New Jersey before moving to Mississippi and then Louisiana, where he worked as a carpenter and architect. He helped design the auditorium of Centenary College in Jackson, Louisiana, in the 1840s, as well as portions of the East Feliciana Parish Courthouse and Lawyers' Row in Clinton, now a National Historic Landmark District.  He also served as a preacher in the Methodist Episcopal Church, South.  Mary Wall worked as an educator, serving as principal at the Clinton Female Seminary, which was incorporated on March 18, 1861, and also served for several years as a public school for local children.</p><p>Mary and Isaac Wall had nine children: six boys and three girls.  Their two eldest sons, Lieut. William Winans Wall (1837-1862?) and Sgt. Benjamin Drake Wall (1840-1864), both served in Louisiana's Crescent Regiment and died during the Civil War, the former of illness and the latter killed at the Battle of Mansfield in April 1864.  The two middle sons, Lieut. Ira Bowman Wall (1843-1928) and Wesley Winans Wall (1846-1922), served with their maternal uncle, Col. Wesley P. Winans, in Company G of the 19th Louisiana Infantry Regiment.  Although their uncle was killed at the Battle of Missionary Ridge in November 1863, the two brothers survived the war.  Ira (called Bow) married Lizzie Embree in 1866 with whom he would have at least four children, and worked as a planter on his in-laws' land in Clinton, called ""Embree Vale.""  Wesley was captured on September 20, 1863, at the Battle of Chickamauga and was held as a prisoner of war at Camp Douglas in Chicago, Illinois, through April 1865.  After the war, he worked in a variety of jobs, including as a telegraph operator and hotel keeper, in cities throughout Mississippi and Louisiana, such as Biloxi, Lafayette, and Cheneyville.  He married Rebecca Burr in 1877 and they had at least two children.  Wesley Wall died in Cheneyville, Louisiana.  Isaac and Mary Wall's two youngest sons were only children during the Civil War.<p>Most of the letters were written either to or by Mary Winans Wall or her son, Wesley.  The earliest letters were written to Mary Wall by friends and family and discuss personal news, mutual friends, and daily life.  These include a letter from William Hezekiah Nathaniel Magruder on September 1, 1833, while he was a student at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut.  Magruder, who would go on to found the Magruder Collegiate Institute in Baton Rouge, describes attending prayer services with ""Doctor Fisk,"" presumed to be Wilbur Fisk, the first president of Wesleyan.</p> <p>Much of the correspondence relates to the Wall family's experiences during the Civil War, including the deaths of three family members and the long imprisonment of Wesley Wall at Camp Douglas.  A November 18, 1860, letter from Benjamin Wall to his younger brother, Wesley, addresses the outcome of the 1860 presidential election and possible actions that the southern states might take as a result, including secession, forming a confederacy, refusing to sell cotton to the North (which he doubts would succeed), and encouraging trade with Europe.  A May 9, 1862, telegram reports on the state of three family members after the 19th Louisiana Infantry Regiment was engaged at the Battle of Farmington, Mississippi: ""Ben slightly wounded; Major Winans not heard from; Bouman not in fight.""  Mary Wall wrote to General Philip Cooke, Union commander in occupied Baton Rouge, in December 1863, seeking permission to cross Union lines to visit her still-living son Benjamin, her widowed sister-in-law in Shreveport, and her widowed daughter-in-law in Franklin, as she simply refused to travel by taking the oath of allegiance to the United States.</p><p>Other correspondence from the Civil War period consists of seventeen letters written to Wesley by his mother, Mary, while he was imprisoned at Camp Douglas between October 23, 1863, and April 15, 1865.  In many of these letters, Mary implores her son to pray, read the Bible, practice his ""careless"" handwriting, and always strive to improve himself and others.  She also shares news of the family, including the deaths of his brother and uncle.  Only one letter from Wesley Wall from this time has survived.  In his October 5, 1864, letter, he indicates that he has been writing to his mother every three weeks, and that his letters must not be getting through to the family.  Mary also wrote to the commander at Camp Douglas on February 14, 1864, asking that her son be paroled and released to the care of two uncles living in the North: ""I have lost two sons in this war, and this boy has been in prison a long time, for one so young.  Please do what you can for me.""  In her May 1, 1864, letter to her imprisoned son, Mary describes the bizarre spectacle of a ring tournament held in wartime: ""Clinton is very gay now, quite too much so, for these sad times.  People seem to think it is no use grieving, and praying any longer, and have parties, picnics, balls, tourneys, &c.  Lizzie Embree was chosen queen, at the tournament near Clinton, by George Bell, who was the victor knight.""   She also mentions in a September 13, 1864, letter about receiving kind treatment from Union soldiers in town, which she attributes to her earlier care for their wounded men brought to Clinton from Baton Rouge.</p><p>Later letters written between 1870 and 1921 typically discuss family matters, including a September 21, 1882, letter from Isaac Dickson Wall (the family's fifth son) to his brother-in-law, Judge William Kernan, in which he asks for counsel on leaving the Methodist ministry, saying that he disagrees with some of its teachings.  Nonetheless, the memory of the Civil War endured through the end of the letters when Ira Bowman Wall, in a November 6, 1912, letter to his brother Wesley, describes attending a Louisiana Confederate veterans' reunion in Baton Rouge, gives news of the death of a former officer in their regiment, and muses on the passage of time since the war: ""You and I are all that are left of Co. G. Caddo Tenth, 19th La. Regt. Inf. Vols, C.S.A. that we know of, and we too I guess, will soon pass away."" </p>"		Winter 2017	2017-2-1	Classics					Front_Center			"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=100 alt=\""Product Cover\"" border=0 src=\""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/May962.jpg\"">"	"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=200 height=124 alt=\""Product Cover\"" border=0 src=\""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/Feb64letter.jpg\"">"	"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=500 height=314 alt=\""Product Cover\"" border=0 src=\""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/May962.jpg\""> "				"<a href=\""http://www.lib.lsu.edu/sites/default/files/sc/findaid/5243.pdf\"">Wall Family Papers</a>"	
6464	9780806154060	$24.95	Black Cowboys in the American West: On the Range, On the Stage, Behind the Badge		Glasrud, Bruce A.	Searles, Michael N		"""Wait a minute.  Blacks Helped Pioneer the West."" -- Herb Jeffries<p>Herb Jeffries, a Detroit jazz singer, was dismayed the first time he saw black audiences in the South lining up outside segregated theaters to watch all white casts in the popular cowboy films of the 1930s.  He was inspired to create films that showed that black cowboys helped win the West, too.  His story is one of many found in Bruce A. Glasrud and Michael N. Searles's broad and fascinating collection of essays on African Americans' experiences in the American West titled <i>Black Cowboys in the American West: On the Range, On the Stage, Behind the Badge</i>.  The editors organize thirteen brief scholarly articles into three categories: ""Cowboys on the Range,"" ""Performing Cowboys,"" and ""Outriders of the Black Cowboys.""  Glasrud introduces the essays; Searles provides a ""concluding overview"" of many of the issues raised in the essays at the end. In this collection, those with interests in the American West and African American history generally will find much that is new and compelling.</p><p>The first section on ""Cowboys on the Range"" begins with a brief, general essay by Deborah M. Liles on the history of African Americans and cattle raising before the Civil War in the American South.  This is an important foundational piece for the rest of the book, as it establishes the long history of African American work in the livestock industry.  In other words, the post-Civil War black cowboys discussed in other essays in the book learned to ride and break horses, care for cattle, and other skills in the era of slavery.  The other four essays in this first section are each devoted to a particular black pioneer in the nineteenth-century West, with chapters on Mathew ""Bones"" Hooks, Johana July, Daniel Webster ""80 John"" Wallace, and Nat Love (a.k.a Deadwood Dick).  Each story provides insight into how African Americans negotiated the perils of Reconstruction and the Jim Crow era in the West.  One theme found in many of the essays is that because black cowboys had specialized skills that whites needed and respected, they sometimes could escape the racial discrimination that other African Americans were forced to endure in that period.  Douglas Hales writes in his piece on Daniel Webster ""80 John"" Wallace, ""Because of the often harsh and dangerous conditions on cattle drives and on the open range, cowhands understood that it was essential to cooperate with each other.  Therefore, black cowboys were often exempted from the severe anti-black attitudes exhibited through much of American society in the post-Civil War era"" (77).  This is very much a continuation of the practice of whites privileging highly skilled slaves that many scholars of slavery have identified, such as in the cases of enslaved iron-workers and sailors.  Women did not often receive the same consideration, which is evident from Cecelia Gutierrez Venable's essay on Johana July, a cowboy of both African American and Native American ancestry.  July's story, based on her WPA interview from the 1930s, reveals much about black, Native, and white relations in the American West, as well as diverse expectations for women in these different cultures.</p><p>The second section of the book, ""Performing Cowboys,"" turns from the experiences of those who worked with cattle in the nineteenth-century West to those of rodeo stars, actors, and singers who evoke the culture of that earlier generation of cowboys in their performances.  Two the articles examine the black rodeo circuits of Texas and Oklahoma in the twentieth century and up to the present day.  The authors, Demetrius W. Pearson on Texas, and Roger D. Hardaway on Oklahoma, reveal that there is a separate circuit of black rodeos -- a ""soul circuit"" -- that mirrors the better known and better funded white rodeo in those states (102).  The segregation of rodeos stretches back to the Jim Crow era, but continues informally today for several reasons.  One of the chief of these is that black rodeo stars do not often receive the sponsorships that white stars do, so they have to work day jobs and cannot participate as often in the white-dominated rodeo circuits.  A third essay in the section, Mary A. Dempsey's ""The Bronze Buckaroo Rides Again: Herb Jeffries is Still Keepin' On"" examines the rise of Hollywood's black cowboy movies in the 1930s, based on the author's interviews with Herb Jeffries before his death.  This very brief piece asserts that Jeffries, a jazz singer, promoted the concept of black cowboy movies to Hollywood producers and ended up being cast as the hero of several films, nicknamed the ""Bronze Buckaroo.""  These films were hardly more realistic than the white-dominated Western films of the time, and were made on scanty budgets that resulted in low-quality productions overall.  However, it is fascinating to learn that in the 1930s, black audiences (these films mainly played in African American theaters) could enjoy films such as Harlem on the Prairie.  The one drawback to Dempsey's essay is its lack of source citations beyond her interview with Jeffries.  The final essay in this section, Alan Govenar's ""Musical Traditions of Twentieth-Century Cowboys"" makes the argument that African American cowboys had different musical traditions than white cowboys; they were more likely to sing blues or church songs than their white counterparts were.  From an organizational point of view, I would have expected Jim Chilcote's ""Charley Willis: a Singing Cowboy"" to be placed in this section so that it would be read in tandem with Govenar's piece, rather than in the final section of the book.</p><p>That last section, ""Outriders of the Black Cowboys,"" is devoted to the experiences of African Americans in the West who were not cowboys but lived on the fringes of cattle country.  Therefore, these essays return to the individuals who lived in the second half of the nineteenth century.  Perhaps the most compelling essay in the entire book is Miantae Metcalf McConnell's ""Mary Field's Road to Freedom.""  Fields, who settled in Montana in the 1880s, was the first African American woman hired as a star route mail carrier by the United States Postal Service -- but she accomplished so much more.  She moved to Montana to help establish a Catholic mission school in the wilderness, carrying out all the manual labor jobs for years with no pay besides room and board to aid her friends among the Ursuline nuns.  Then, with little warning or justification, the first Catholic bishop of Montana demanded that she leave the service of the school.  She then became the only black resident of Cascade, where she opened a café and laundry service.  In her sixties, she applied for and received her Post Office commission to carry the mail long distance over rough, unsettled terrain, and she continued in that position for eight years, carrying that mail incredible distances --once traveling 34 miles on snowshoes to get the mail through!  This is an excellent analysis of a woman's life of service and accomplishment despite awful limitations based on her gender and race.  The remaining essays in this section examine African American life in nineteenth-century Dodge City, Kansas, and the history of Bass Reeves, a U.S. Marshall for thirty-two years in Arkansas.  The first essay, C. Robert Haywood's ""'No Less a Man': Blacks in Cow Town Dodge City, 1876-1886"" complements the earliest ones in this volume by emphasizing that while black cowboys did sometimes receive preferential treatment by whites because of their specialized skills, other African Americans in the West faced the full brunt of discrimination and abuse. Haywood writes, ""The concessions made by white residents to the black cowboy were not necessarily extended to other members of the race"" (184).  He relates that there was a great deal of turnover in the black population over that ten-year period, and while there were some successful exceptions, such as restaurateur Sallie Frasier, African Americans in Dodge City generally had few economic opportunities and were mocked and criticized in the local newspaper and by the town's white population.  The final essay, Art T. Burton's Bass Reeves: a Legendary Lawman of the Western Frontier,"" briefly reviews Bass Reeve's heroic career as an ""invincible"" Deputy U.S. Marshal -- perhaps the first African American to serve in that role west of the Mississippi River.  While Burton's piece is primarily narrative in nature, it is easy to connect his success and fame to that of a select few black cowboys of the same period; impressive abilities outweighed his race among most whites, exempting him from the limitations enforced upon most African Americans of his day.  His imposing frame, fearlessness, exemplary shooting and riding skills, and unimpeachable integrity (he once led a manhunt against his own son, who ran from justice after killing his wife) all made him a legend in early Arkansas.</p>   <p>In short, <i>Black Cowboys in the American West</i> has much to offer both fans and scholars of the West and of African American history.  Many of its engaging essays would work well in an undergraduate classroom, while the issues that emerge regarding the black experience in the West are sure to inspire further thought and research by historians.</p><p><i>Jennifer Oast is an Associate Professor of History at Bloomsburg University and is the author of </i>Institutional Slavery: Slaveholding Churches, Schools, Colleges, and Businesses in Virginia, 1680 -1860<i> (Cambridge, 2016).</i></p>"	Oast, Jennifer	Spring 2017	2017-5-1	Review			University of Oklahoma Press		Politics;Reconstruction;Social_History			"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=243 alt=\""Product Cover\"" border=0 src=\""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/blackcowboysf.jpg\"">"							
6566	1613737971	$26.99	Lincoln's Pathfinder: John C. Fremont and the Violent Election of 1856		Bicknell, John			"1856: Moment of Change<p>The famed historian David Potter once wrote that if John Calhoun had been alive to witness the election of 1856, he might have observed ""a further snapping of the cords of the Union."" ""The Whig cord had snapped between 1852 and 1856,"" he argued ""and the Democratic cord was drawn very taut by the sectional distortion of the party's geographical equilibrium."" According to Potter, the Republican party ""claimed to be the only one that asserted national principles, but it was totally sectional in its constituency, with no pretense to bi-sectionalism, and it could not be regarded as a cord of the Union at all.""<sup>1</sup> He was right on all accounts, and John Bicknell captures the essence of this dramatic political contest that epitomized the struggle of a nation divided over slavery.</p><p>To be sure, the election of 1856 marked a turning point in the republic's political culture, if for no other reason than it signaled significant change on the democratic horizon. It had been more than two decades since the last time the word Republican had been used in a political contest, and the character of the party had fundamentally changed. In this new work, Bicknell offers a narrative history that helps explain how politics took center stage amid the sectional strife of the 1850s, and how it intensified the political struggle to maintain the Union. By the mid-1850s, slavery, and the threat of disunion posed by it, was escalating beyond repair. Although some contemporaries hailed the Compromise of 1850 as a victory that prevented civil war, settlers moving into the new territory in Kansas and Nebraska came to test the permeability of those resolutions. Congress continued to wrestle with slavery's future within an ever-expanding Union, and change would need to come from the ballot box. </p><p>Amid the backdrop of the ""Bleeding Kansas"" violence resulting from the Kansas-Nebraska Act, the sack of Lawrence, and the retaliation by John Brown's band at Pottawatomie Creek, as well as the beating of abolitionist Charles Sumner at the hands of pro-slavery South Carolina congressman Preston Brooks, political canvassing took place for the 1856 election. The Whigs and Democrats, already divided by the Compromise of 1850 into pro-and anti-slavery factions, contended with Republicans, a new party, and John C. Frémont, the charismatic path-finding leader whose wife Jessie helped him blaze a path to the nomination. Bicknell explores how previously scattered abolitionist and anti-slavery factions managed to achieve a degree of unity in the formation of the new party that offered the first serious challenge to the status quo that had allowed slavery to expand westward with the unfolding republic. He examines how anti-slavery politicians such as New Yorkers Thurlow Weed and William Seward, Missouri's Francis Preston Blair, and Ohioans Salmon P. Chase and John McLean played a role in the creation of the new political party. Members of the Democratic Party tried to keep the union together by compromise and by seeking to appease the slaveholding interests. Franklin Pierce the ""doughface"" president who presided over these turbulent years, gave way to a colorful and determined group of political party leaders including James Buchanan, Stephen Douglas, Howell Cobb and Alexander Stephens, Millard Fillmore, and Thomas Hart Benton determined to carry on the prominence of the slave power. The end result was a three-way contest between American party candidate Millard Fillmore and Pennsylvania doughface Buchanan in the South, and Buchanan and Frémont in the North. Democrats had the advantage of a sizeable campaign chest and organization, and managed a comfortable victory in the Electoral College. Yet, the Republicans could see victory in the future in the defeat of 1856, and it frightened Democrats.</p><p>In the end, the election of 1856 reflected the precarious nature of the times, and Bicknell aptly chronicles how Frémont epitomized the romance of the unique campaign and its evangelical nature that heightened the underlying principle of the Free-Soil movement. In doing so, he has given us another illuminating account of the man and the hour who in losing the election of 1856 helped propel the anti-expansion of slavery movement forward.</p><p><i>Stephen D.

Rossino plants the seeds for the distance in their relationship as early as '62. The military triumvirate of Lee, Longstreet, and Jackson guide a large part of this dialogue. All three men were, by this time, accomplished at leading men and completing missions. Yet they were also caught unaware by the Union response at South Mountain. No one pointed fingers . . . yet. The way the author handles this is skillfully done, weaving just enough pride into each man without creating a scapegoat.</p> <p>Henry Kyd Douglas, Porter Alexander, and ""Jeb"" Stuart are examples of characters about whom much information is available, but Gilbert Farney, Billy Dennis, and Pat Cannon, although based on real members of the 6th Alabama Infantry, Company D are different. Their characters are created from the reading of countless letters from private soldiers in the Confederate Army. Every person is believable, from the citizens of Sharpsburg to the top commanders. Publisher Ted Savas adds, ""I also thought the 'fog of war' technique was brilliantly done. You only know what Lee and the main characters knew at the time of the events. And because we know what happened in real life, the decisions they make and how they make them is all the more exciting. "" </p><p>Additionally, there are three maps drawn by Gene Tharpe. One presents the entire Maryland Campaign, September 2-20 1862; another shows the Battle of South Mountain on September 14, 1862; the third details the Battle of Antietam on September 17 1862. </p><p>It is impossible to read this book without making a mental comparison with another ""novel of the Civil War, "" <i>Killer Angels</i>. When asked about this, author Rossino replied, ""When considering writing the book I thought Sharpsburg/Antietam deserved treatment in a novel like Mike Shaara gave Gettysburg in his book. My choice of following the 6th Alabama Infantry Regiment was in part a tip of the hat to Shaara as the 6th fought on the far left of the Confederate line at South Mountain like the 20th Maine fought on the far left of the Union line at Gettysburg. Things turned out differently for the 6th, though. ""</p> <p>Personally, I would love to see a movie made out of this novel. It is a terrifically entertaining, knowledgeable read with realistic dialogue, and the movie sort of plays itself in one's mind anyway. As to reviewing a work of fiction in these pages, I would like to remind each of us that more often than not, a work of fiction--be it a movie or a book--is what got many of us here in the first place. <i>Six Days in September</i> is definitely not one's average Civil War novel.</p><p><i>Meg Groeling received her MA in Military History, with a Civil War emphasis, in 2016, from American Public University.

6336	9780807161968	$48.00	Abolitionizing Missouri: German Immigrants and Racial Ideology in Nineteenth-Century America		Anderson, Kristen Layne			"A Divided Coalition: The Politics of German Missouri<p>Missouri has long been a state whose diversity is all-too-often unrecognized or misunderstood by outsiders. There East merges with West and North overlaps with South; it is part Rust Belt, part Farm Belt, and part Ozark hill country. Over the past two centuries it has also been a common destination for numerous immigrant groups hoping to make a better life for themselves in the United States. In <i>Abolitionizing Missouri: German Immigrants and Racial Ideology in Nineteenth Century Missouri</i>, Kristen Layne Anderson describes the crucial contributions that one of these groups -- German Missourians -- made to the early political history of the state. Her narrative spans roughly from 1848 to 1870, encompassing the crucial years of political turmoil leading up to the Civil War, the war itself, and the immediate post-war period during which Missourians struggled to define a place in their society, not only for African Americans, but for other marginalized or disenfranchised groups like immigrants, women, and ex-Confederates. </p> <p>Drawing on an impressive array of secondary and primary sources -- including archival collections, government documents, and both English and German-Language newspapers -- Anderson argues persuasively for discarding the traditional view that German Missourians operated as an almost monolithic political bloc that opposed slavery expansion before the Civil War, championed emancipation during the war, and fought valiantly for black suffrage and citizenship rights after the war. Instead she advocates what may be called for a ""spectrum"" model that recognizes the diversity of opinions that existed <i>within</i> the German community in Missouri over issues like slavery expansion, emancipation, and black rights, while also emphasizing the steady political evolution that took place among Missouri Germans over these issues. </p><p>For much of the antebellum period, for example, most German Missourians preferred to keep the issue of slavery at arm's length. Germans seldom owned slaves, but just as rarely did they openly challenge or critique the institution, accepting that ""slavery was a legal part of Missouri society"" that they could not change. (p. 19) This reluctance to address slavery openly stemmed in part from a fear of provoking a nativist backlash against themselves as a ""foreign"" element trying to undermine the laws and customs of their adopted state. German passivity on the slavery issue came to an end, however, after the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854, which marked a ""key turning point in German American attitudes toward slavery."" (p. 43) After Kansas-Nebraska, German Missourians became increasingly worried that the spread of slavery would hinder their own access to new land in the western territories, and so many of them drifted steadily toward the anti-slavery or ""free soil"" camps. A few even openly discussed emancipating Missouri's slave population, talk that provoked alarm among Missouri nativists who accused them of ""trying to remake America in a European image. (p. 74) </p><p>During the Civil War, the evolution of German attitudes toward slavery accelerated. As ardent supporters of the Union -- an astounding 80 percent of Union volunteers in the three-month regiments created in 1861 were German (p. 88) -- Missouri Germans increasingly embraced emancipation, first as a war measure and then as a positive goal in itself. They formed emancipation societies, supported General John C. Frémont's ""confiscation policy,"" criticized Lincoln for being too slow in attacking slavery, and even helped defeat St. Louis's Republican congressman Frank P. Blair in the 1862 election because they considered him too soft on the issue. During this period the German community, particularly in St. Louis, fractured into ""radical"" and ""conservative"" camps, both competing with one another for political influence at the municipal and state levels of government. Both generally supported emancipation, but they clashed over issues like black suffrage, the presence of ""contraband"" (or ""fugitive"") slaves in St. Louis, or whether the government should recruit black soldiers. Two flashpoints of conflict between these groups occurred during the St. Louis mayoral race of 1864, and the political battle over Missouri's 1863 emancipation ordinance. Most conservative Germans supported the ordinance, while the radicals assailed it as being too gradual because it would not have freed <b><i>all</i></b> slaves in Missouri until 1876. </p><p>As long as the war continued, radical Germans tended to hold the upper hand, at least within the German community. After the war, Missouri Germans continued their political evolution. During the immediate post-war period the dominant political concern became deciding what place Missouri's newly freed black population would hold in their society, and on this issue as well Germans took a variety of positions. Many radical Germans aggressively championed legal and constitutional reforms that would guarantee the right of black Missourians to acquire an education, access public transportation and accommodations, worship freely, and conduct their own economic lives, not to mention securing the right to vote for black males. On these and other issues, conservative Germans tended to take a more cautious, sometimes skeptical approach. Some Germans, for example, applauded President Johnson's veto of the 1866 Civil Rights Bill, while others opposed the integration of segregated spaces like St. Louis streetcars, hotels, ballrooms, and other public facilities. </p> <p>No issue proved more divisive, however, than black suffrage, to which Anderson devotes the final chapter of her book. German conservatives tended to oppose black suffrage. During the 1865 constitutional convention, for example, organs of the conservative German press like the <i>Neue Anzeiger des Westens</i> criticized an amendment offered by German radical delegate Arnold Krekel that would have extended suffrage <i>both</i> to white immigrants and the freedmen, arguing that ""the two questions fundamentally have nothing to do with each other."" (p. 176) On this question, at least, German conservatives tended to hold the upper hand, both within their own community and in the state at large. The 1865 convention ultimately rejected black suffrage, which was defeated again in 1868 by a referendum on a constitutional amendment that would have gradually extended the voting franchise to black males. At that referendum, even the heavily German wards in St. Louis voted overwhelmingly <b><i>against</i></b> black suffrage. Consequently, black Missourians would not receive the vote until the ratification of the 15th Amendment in 1870, the same year (ironically) that Missouri repealed its disenfranchisement measures against ex-confederates. </p><p>There is much to like about this book: the author has clearly synthesized a huge amount of research to produce a concise, carefully argued monograph that fills an obvious void in previous scholarship related to this period in Missouri's history. I find little to argue with in her major conclusions. That being said, a few minor defects in this book bear mentioning. One concerns Anderson's style and organization. Although for the most part her prose is crisp and clear, she can occasionally become somewhat repetitive, and the over-use of section headings within her chapters can be a bit distracting. Additionally, at several points in her narrative Anderson mentions the ""forty-eighters"" -- Germans who immigrated to the United States after the political upheavals of 1848 in their home country. She views them as a key determinant of German political radicalism in Missouri, but does not elaborate on the source of their radicalism. Although Anderson does cite historians like Bruce Levine and Mischa Honeck who have written about the politics of the ""forty-eighters"" in greater detail, she herself does not explain how the events of 1848 in Germany could have so decisively shifted these people in the direction of radical politics in Missouri. It might have edified her readers if she did. Likewise, since many of her subjects were as yet un-naturalized immigrants, it might have benefited her readers to include a brief explanation of the naturalization process at that time. </p><p>These reservations should not, however, obscure the greater merits of Anderson's work. She has produced what will likely become a go-to reference work on the political history of German Missourians from the late antebellum period through the tumultuous years of the Civil War and Reconstruction. That is no small accomplishment, and I recommend that all students of Missouri history -- whether professional historians or lay persons -- add it to their libraries. </p> <p><i>Dr. Matthew J.

6508	9780809334520	$34.50	The Tennessee Campaign of 1864		Ed. Woodworth, Steven	Ed. Grear, Charles D		"A Doomed Dream: The Tennessee Campaign of 1864<p>Until the late 1960s, Civil War historians and enthusiasts focused their attention on the war in the east, that bloody 100-mile stretch between Richmond, Virginia and Washington D.C.  The slaughters at Antietam and Gettysburg have also consumed scholar's attention.</p><p>In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the late Thomas Connelly directed historians' interests to the area west of the Appalachian Mountains.  The 'Western Theater,"" considered the heartland of the Confederacy, stretched from the Appalachians to the banks of the Mississippi.  It was here that Professor Connelly stressed that the war was won and lost.</p><p>Editors Steven E. Woodworth, a professor of history at Texas Christian University, and Charles D. Grear, professor of history at Central Texas College, have filled in the scholarly gaps in this area with an excellent collection of essays in <i>The Tennessee Campaign of 1864</i>.</p><p>The majority of the essays make the point that after the fall of Atlanta to Sherman's army on September 1, 1864, the Southern Confederacy was a doomed dream.  The following campaign in north Georgia and Middle Tennessee only prolonged the agony.  The first chapter is ""The Long Lost Diary of Major General Patrick R. Cleburne,"" edited by William Lee White, historian and park ranger at the Chickamauga Battlefield.  Major General Cleburne, known as the ""Stonewall of the West,"" was the best combat commander the Army of the Tennessee had; his division was the best trained and prepared.  Cleburne was known to have kept a diary, but it has never surfaced and little of his personal writings exist.  White was fortunate enough to stumble across excerpts published in an 1894 newspaper from a diary Cleburne started prior to his final campaign. White says the diary reveals nothing really new about Cleburne, but confirms a number of assumptions.  In a biographical sketch, White states that Cleburne enjoyed reading poetry and scientific articles.  His diary entries reveal an excellent writer, strict attention to detail, and a very sensitive nature that appreciated natural beauty.</p><p>Chapter Two, by Stewart Bennett, chair of social and behavioral sciences and instructor of history at Blue Mountain College in Blue Mountain, Mississippi, is entitled ""The Storm Broke in all its Fury: The Struggle for Allatoona Pass.""  The battle of Allatoona Pass in northwest Georgia was a struggle that epitomized the bad luck and tragedy of the Army of Tennessee in the campaign of 1864.  This bloody confrontation resulted from Hoods' plan to force the Federals to evacuate Atlanta.  At first the plan began well; Hood then sent orders to Major General Stewart to send his division commander, General Samuel D. French, to Allatoona Pass.  French was to assume control of the pass, fortify the position and destroy the bridge over the nearby Etowah River, all before Sherman could react.  French had been warned by locals that the Federals had fortified, garrisoned and established a supply depot there.</p>  Sherman had realized the importance of the position, as it could be easily defended from either direction.  As a result, Allatoona became an important supply depot for the Federals, protecting about one million rations and nine thousand head of cattle.  But inexplicably, Hood was uninformed that the pass would be heavily fortified and that the terrain would make the Federal position very difficult to take.</p><p>Dr. Bennett's detailed account of the ensuing struggle for Allatoona Pass highlights the difficulties under the best conditions of a military campaign in the mountains of northwest Georgia. Lack of knowledge of the terrain, bad roads impassable in inclement weather, conflicting orders, and at times a total lack of communication guaranteed the disastrous outcome for French's small division; one of the tragedies that lay in store for the Army of Tennessee.</p><p>In Chapter Three, ""Errant Moves on the Chessboard of War: The Battle of Spring Hill, November 29, 1864,"" John R. Lundberg, professor of history at Tarrant County College, Texas, points out that many historians view Spring Hill as a lost opportunity for the South to change the course of the war.  Hood did lose a chance to defeat the Union Army under General John Schofield, but the importance of Spring Hill has been overstated for two reasons: Southerners have woven the battle of Spring Hill into the myth of the Lost Cause in the misguided belief that the Confederacy still had a chance to win.  Second, Spring Hill is viewed as a prelude to the disasters at Franklin and Nashville.  These beliefs stress that the Confederacy could have avoided these defeats by winning at Spring Hill.  Professor Lundberg thoroughly invalidates these assumptions. Moreover, he also points out that Hood's subordinates bear much of the responsibility.  A good example is the escape of Schofield's army directly through the arms of the Confederates to safety at Franklin.  This incident alone remains the great enigma of the Tennessee Campaign of 1864.</p>  <p>Chapter Four is by Andrew S. Bledsoe, assistant professor of history at Lee University, Cleveland Tennessee.  Professor Lee stresses that the Battle of Franklin was a senseless slaughter.  Sixty-eight Confederate field officers were killed, wounded or captured.  The culture of the Army of Tennessee called for their commanders to lead from the front, lest morale be destroyed and result in a failure of command.  The disembowelment of the officer corps did destroy the army's morale and command structure and was harsh even by Civil War standards.  Professor Bledsoe's interesting essay concludes that Hood's recklessness was responsible for destroying the cream of his officer corps at Franklin.</p><p>Chapter Five, ""Killing at Franklin: Anatomy of Slaughter,"" by Jonathan M. Steplyk, Ph.D., contrasts the battle of Franklin with Pickett's final advance at Gettysburg.  He delves in to the emotional and psychological aspects of killing in the Civil War, using examples from the Battle of Franklin.  Dr. Steplyk says that the subject of the psychology of killing in combat has gained interest among military historians.  To kill in combat requires the suppression of natural and cultural inhibitions; many factors, however, influence how and to what extent this affects the soldier's mind.  This is a very interesting and thought-provoking essay on a subject that until recently has not drawn much attention.</p><p>Brooks D. Simpson, professor of history at Arizona State University, presents a fascinating discussion on the relationship between Grant and George H. Thomas prior to the Battle of Nashville.  He meticulously examines Grant's attitudes and concerns toward Thomas' ostensible reluctance to attack Hood's battered army.  Continuing the discussion of Thomas' military ability, Professor Paul L. Schmelzer, military history instructor at Fort Carson, Colorado, challenges those historians who claim George Thomas was a military genius.  Using Carl von Clausewitz's definition of a military genius, Thomas falls short.  In brief, Clausewitz suggests that those who look for military genius should look past battlefield tactics and consider the success or failure of the political objectives.  Schmelzer concludes that while Thomas was an excellent tactician, he failed to grasp Grant's overall strategy for winning the war.</p><p>D. L. Turner, independent author, historian and instructor, and Scott L. Stabler, professor of history at Grand Valley State University, Michigan, gives us an informative discussion of the significant role that black troops played in the Battle of Nashville.  Out of about 50,000 African Americans that fought for the Union, 13,000 of these soldiers fought with Thomas at Nashville.</p><p>Editor Steven E. Woodworth provides an entertaining discussion of A.J. Smith's detachment at the Battle of Nashville.  The author contends that Major General Andrew Jackson Smith's three divisions played the most important role in George Thomas' victory over Hood at Nashville.  Among other reasons, Woodworth gives three major factors that contributed to this success -- excellent leadership, skilled use of artillery, and the aggressive character of Smith's command.</p><p>The tenth essay is contributed by Dr. John J. Gaines, professor of history at American Public University.  The study of civilian participants in the Civil War is somewhat of a neglected topic.  Dr. Gaines points out that just as officers and enlisted men bore witness to the terrible effects of combat, so did civilians in the vicinity of Franklin and Nashville.  Despite the horrors, civilians took on many supportive roles during and after the battle.</p><p>Editor Charles D. Grear examines not only the performance but the attitudes of Texans in the Tennessee Campaign of 1864.  Since Texans were on the western flank of the Confederacy, they enjoyed more choices of areas in which to serve.  Consequently they served in all theaters of conflict and in more states and territories than any other state, Confederate or Union.</p><p>The final two essays are contributed by Timothy B. Smith, professor of history at the University of Tennessee, Martin and Jennifer M. Murray, assistant professor of history at University of Virginia, Wise.  Dr. Smith gives us a detailed overview of the successful efforts to preserve the Franklin Battlefield while Dr. Murray gives the same treatment to the less successful attempts to save the battlefield of Nashville.</p><p><i>The Tennessee Campaign of 1864</i> is a splendid compilation which should not only appeal to scholars in the field, but any Civil War enthusiast.</p><p><i>Dr. Wallace Cross specializes in Tudor and Stuart England and British Empire at Austin Peay State University, Tennessee with an interest in the American Civil War.

6616	9781131178097	$10.00	Civil War Obscura: Lincoln On the Eve of '61		Villard, Henry			"A Journalist's View of Lincoln	<p>For those of us who enjoy searching for, and reading, out-of-print books about the Civil War era, look no further. This column, Civil War Obscura, focuses on popular, but lesser known books of the period. No printed text is off limits; fiction, non-fiction, personal memoirs, and virtually all other printed materials are all welcome here. The goal here is to introduce both lay readers, independent scholars, and academics to historical voices beyond their usual interests or specializations. I hope Civil War Obscura is well received. Please feel inspired to add suggestions of your own!</p>	<p>The first book in this project is <i>Lincoln on the Eve of '61: A Journalist's Story</i> by Henry Villard. Best known as a successful nineteenth-century railroad promoter and financier, German-born Henry Villard (1835--1900) was also among the most conscientious and able journalists of the 1860s. Villard filed stories from the Illinois capital almost daily to the New York <i>Herald</i>, slightly less often to the Cincinnati <i>Commercial</i>, and occasionally to the San Francisco <i>Bulletin</i>. He was twenty-five and had only been in the United States for seven years when he was given the job of reporting on President-elect Lincoln from the time of his election in November 1860 to his arrival in Washington in February 1861.</p>	<p>It is only 105 pages long, but packed with personal observations and slim slices of Lincoln's life. It was published in 1940 by the Curtis Publishing Company and edited by Harold and Oswald Villard, sons of Henry Villard and Fanny Garrison Villard. Fanny was the daughter of abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison. I suspect the Villards were truly a ""power couple"" of their time.</p>	<p>During the time Villard was with Lincoln, he sent scores of dispatches from Springfield, Illinois describing the president-elect's doings, quoting or paraphrasing his statements, chronicling events in the Illinois capital, and analyzing the city's mood. This sort of journalism makes Lincoln and his entourage seem much more human, at least to me, and the dispatches gathered in this volume constitute the most intensive--nay, intimate--journalistic coverage that Lincoln ever received.</p> 	 <p>Lincoln welcomed Villard and encouraged him to ask questions, as he was the only full-time correspondent for out-of-town papers. Villard spoke with inside sources, such as Lincoln's private secretaries John G. Nicolay and John Hay, devoted friends like Jesse K. Dubois and Stephen T. Logan, political leaders like Governor Richard Yates, and journalists like William M. Springer and Robert R. Hitt. All too often these men are overlooked. They were not generals, and they often get lost in the fog of war, yet they were President Lincoln's support group, and they firmly connected him to his Illinois roots, even when Washington politics appeared to overwhelm everything.</p> 	<p>This small book filled with examples of Henry Villard's terrifically wry sense of humor, making the writing very readable.  For instance, he boasted that he did Lincoln a service by scaring off would-be office seekers who, fearing to see their names published in newspapers, gave up plans to visit the Illinois capital to badger the president-elect. Villard may have done an even greater service by publicizing Lincoln's views on the secession crisis. After all, many only knew Lincoln from what they read in the newspapers. It was the reporting of the Cooper Union speech that first made him a man of interest outside of his native Illinois. It was Villard who approached president-elect Lincoln on the Inaugural Express train after it had left Springfield on February 10, 1861. He requested a copy of Lincoln's ""farewell address, "" just given minutes before the train departed. Lincoln wrote it out and Villard telegraphed it to the New York <i>Herald</i> along with this report: ""The cheers are always for Lincoln and the Constitution. The President-elect continues reserved and thoughtful, and sits most of the time alone in the private saloon prepared for his special use. ""</p>	<p>Not only informative but also highly readable, Villard's vivid descriptions of Lincoln's appearance, daily routine, and visitors, combined with fresh information about Springfield, state political leaders, and the capital, constitute an invaluable resource. The ""Prologue"" provides an excellent background of Villard's friendship with Lincoln, and the ""Epilogue"" contains Villard's account of Lincoln's 1860 inauguration.</p>	<p>After all the books that have made Abraham Lincoln into an American icon, it is pure pleasure to read one in which annoyance with the Lincoln children is a recurrent theme. The small volume is not hard to get; it is available at amazon.com for about $10.00. It is also available at books.google.com, but not as a PDF file. It shows up on eBay occasionally as well. This little treasure is worth the effort to obtain, and I highly recommend adding it to your personal collection.</p>	<p><i>Meg Groeling received her MA in Military History, with a Civil War emphasis, in 2016, from American Public University.

6353	9780871404688	$49.95	Picturing Frederick Douglass:An Illustrated Biography of the Nineteenth Century\'s Most Photographed American		Stauffer, John; Trodd, Zoe	Bernier, Celeste-Marie		"A Life in Images: The Many Faces of Frederick Douglass<p>Black abolitionist Frederick Douglass sat for a portrait nearly every year of his life from 1841 until his death in 1895. Although this frequency does not necessarily prove the headline-ready subtitle of <i>Picturing Frederick Douglass: An Illustrated Biography of the Nineteenth Century's Most Photographed American</i>, it grants such a claim credence. By combing archives throughout the United States, finding 160 distinct images and evidence of the existence of others, editors John Stauffer, Zoe Trodd, and Celeste-Marie Bernier demonstrate Douglass's enduring fascination with the photographic reproduction of the human form. In this volume, they have included not only a catalog of all of these photographs, but Douglass's four speeches on photography, a scholarly introduction, two photo essays of artwork based on Douglass portraits, an Afterword by Henry Louis Gates, and an Epilogue by Douglass descendant Kenneth Morris, Jr. </p><p>In our era of Facebook, Instagram, and Photoshop, viewers expect manipulation and have become cynical about images in all senses of the word. In the nineteenth century, however, photography offered a shocking, lifelike glimpse into the faces of distant family, celebrities, and one's own self. Given other modes of representation at the time, photography seemed to be the most trustworthy. Indeed, the first photographic process, the daguerreotype, can still astonish with its fine reproduction of texture and dimension, giving the impression that the subject sits just beyond the glass. The method became widely available when studios began opening throughout the United States in 1839, only a year after Douglass had escaped from slavery, and photography flourished in parallel to and as part of Douglass's career as an activist. </p> <p>Douglass had criticized his earliest abolitionist allies for using his body and biography as the text for their exegesis, resenting their desire to interpret his experience. Like later scholars, he understood image as text and the power of image to influence thought. For that reason, he detested non-photographic renderings of himself, and fought endlessly with his publishers over his frontispiece portraits and the illustrations included in his final autobiography, <i>Life and Times of Frederick Douglass</i> (1882). He resisted well-meaning but still prejudiced efforts to Anglicize his features or soften his expressions.  Some of these depictions appear in ""Part II:  Contemporary Artwork,"" and they suggest that the earlier artists had a difficult time creating an accurate portrait while those creating racist caricatures had possibly never seen him. Later cartoons and illustrations testify to the widespread distribution of his photos in their resemblance, but do not possess the same drama that the photos themselves convey. </p><p>Photography, like autobiography, allowed Douglass a modicum of control in the depiction of his person and, by extension, the bodies of all African Americans. The most beautiful, important, and widely circulated of these appear in ""Part I: The Photographs,"" the centerpiece of <i>Picturing Frederick Douglass</i>.  These exquisitely rendered plates collectively act as a flipbook animating the abolitionist as he ages from a haunted youth through his middle years as a fiery activist to his disappointed and then contented twilight years and, finally, on his deathbed. Some of the earliest, in which he does not address the camera, suggest that he saw himself as the object of observation, holding himself as an exemplar of refined and intelligent manhood. As the 1850s progressed, however, he returned to his initial instinct to fix his gaze on his audience, meeting them as equals. Later, he tended toward a three-quarters pose, always wearing an expression as if looking to the future with determination. Even when he does not stare down his audience, his intent visage admits few other responses than the respect he commands. The editors also point to features that indicate he consulted advice books on posing, such as holding his hand in a fist, and argue that he collaborated with photographers to produce the most compelling results. Readers can evaluate the editors' analysis in ""Part V: <i>Catalogue Raisonn""</i>,"" which includes all of the 160 images of Douglass, single portraits as well as groups and what later generations would call snapshots. Some of the photos in this section lack the immediacy of those in the first and support the editors' assertions that he worked with the photographers to find the best representation. </p> <p>The editors' shortcomings, however, lie in the limits of the context that they provide for these portraits. An introduction should prepare the readers for the images that follow, offering information not readily observable or knowable from what readers see on the page. While the editors do well when addressing Douglass's essays and the history of the craft of photography, their interpretation of the images themselves lacks historical nuance. They make many features seem unique to Douglass, such as the absence of props or backdrops and his clothing and fashion choice, and they do not address the other work of photographers when available nor specific popular depictions of African Americans to which Douglass responds. The portraits of black Congressmen and senators during Reconstruction, for instance, resemble those of Douglass in the same period, indicating either that he influenced those men in their self-representation or more likely, that they fit into the style of the studio they visited.  If Douglass collaborated with photographers to create a particular image or style, then investigation into the other work of those photographers, where available, might offer more evidence for the editors' assertions. Furthermore, Douglass was hardly unique in dressing well for the camera, as the editors leave their audience to infer, and their description of him as a fashion trend-setter not only lacks citation but also does not engage with scholarship on African American clothing and such issues as the charged subject of hair. What, too, to make of later shots of Douglass from behind, when he otherwise seemed so intent on presenting his visage to the public? As a result, Douglass seems to exist in isolation when, as the editors themselves point out, he actually engaged in a visual conversation with popular culture, artists, political ideologies, and scientific theories. </p> <p>In the latter category, the editors miss their greatest opportunity to explore the political import of Douglass's portraits. While Henry Louis Gates, Jr.'s Epilogue addresses some of the introduction's flaws in describing popular caricatures of African Americans, the editors miss important visual points that Douglass made and that reinforce the words of his essays, especially in their failure to address the contemporary fields of science. Theories emerging from phrenology, physiognomy, and ethnology gave intellectual gravity to racist ideologies, which Douglass himself countered in his writings on photography and elsewhere. Louis Agassiz's 1850 series of daguerreotypes of slave and the illustrations from Josiah Nott and George Robins Gibbons' 1854 <i>The Types of Mankind</i>, both appeared at a time when Douglass had begun to frequent photography studios. His presentation of himself as well-dressed and aggressively confronting the viewer, particularly in a daguerreotype made around 1850, stands in stark opposition to Agassiz's naked and coerced African subjects. Two profile portraits, taken sometime between 1850 and 1855, refute the ape-like drawings of Africans in the work of Nott and Gibbons.  A later profile in a fur hat seems to address Elizabeth Cady Stanton's depiction of him, written during their clash over the wording of the 15th Amendment, as the wolfish villain of a fairy tale. Thus, while the editors argue much about Douglass and photographs, they do not make the historical connections that would illuminate Douglass's ideas and their own assertions. </p> <p>The most complex interpretation, in fact, comes from the one contributor to the volume who is neither a historian nor literary scholar. The editors have included ""Part III: The Photographic Legacy"" to testify to the endurance of Douglass's image, but it pales in comparison to the personal story of Kenneth Morris, Jr., the descendant of Douglass through his son and grandson, Charles and Joseph Douglass. The image of so famous an ancestor hung over Douglass's descendants both figuratively and literally, contributing to the suicide of Morris's grandfather but also leading Morris to work against modern-day slavery. His essay testifies to the success of Douglass's photographic venture. While the editors have fallen short in key points of historical interpretation, in assembling this volume they have offered both an extensive archive and allowed Douglass to fix his gaze across time and challenge his viewers to continue the ongoing process of liberation. </p><p><i>Leigh Fought is an Assistant Professor of History at Le Moyne College, Syracuse, New York.

"A Life Saving Friendship: Abraham Lincoln and Joshua Speed	<p>In this interesting book, Charles B. Strozier, who is both an academic historian and a practicing psychotherapist, shares his thoughts about the important dynamics of the friendship between Abraham Lincoln and Joshua Speed, who became acquainted in 1837, when Lincoln first settled in Springfield, Illinois.</p>	<p>The most significant fact about the friendship, in Strozier's view, was that it saved Lincoln's life  --  beyond a doubt, and in terms that must be taken quite literally.  Lincoln experienced two episodes of clinical depression in his early adulthood, the first in 1835 and the second in 1841.  In both episodes, he was intermittently suicidal, and Strozier argues convincingly that Speed played a crucial role in helping Lincoln to regain his emotional equilibrium in the second episode.</p>	<p>The profundity of the distinction between what Strozier calls ""garden-variety depression"" and clinical depression is hammered home right away by the author, who, as a medical practitioner, explains that ""clinical depression takes one into a dark hole where creativity languishes along with the self.  Nothing hopeful can emerge from such an experience.  It is toxic.""  Anyone who has experienced this state will recognize the truth of Strozier's description, and the challenge of emerging from this dark and bottomless hole was enormous in the days before the existence of the medications that are now miraculously available.</p>	<p>One of the emotional triggers for Lincoln in these early days was without a doubt early trauma regarding the death of certain loved ones, including his mother, his sister, and, perhaps most of importantly of all, his young sweetheart Ann Rutledge. Lincoln's legendary love for this woman was dismissed for generations by scholars as a legend in the pejorative sense of that term, i.e., as a legend in the sense of a myth.  In the past thirty years, however, careful scholarship by several historians has turned that conventional wisdom on its head, and it can no longer be doubted that Lincoln was ardently in love with Ann Rutledge, whose death drove him nearly insane.</p>	<p>Issues concerning Lincoln's love life were also integral to his second attack of clinical depression in 1841. Strozier tells the story of how ""in his experience of a successful quest for love and intimacy indirectly through his friend Speed in early 1842, Lincoln found his emotional compass . . . . He was never again suicidal.""</p>	<p>One of the salient points of this book is its vigorous argument against the recent notion that Lincoln might have been bisexual in light of the fact that he slept in the same bed with Speed . . . and with other men as well.  Strozier argues against this idea in two ways.  First, he contends that a huge cultural difference separates the norms of the early nineteenth century from contemporary practices in matters of masculine friendship as well as in various matters of sexuality.  ""It takes a leap of the imagination,"" he writes, to conceive of a time ""when young men could be, indeed were assumed to be, close, bonded, and intimate, even sleeping together, <i>without</i> being sexual partners,"" but such, he argues, was the situation that was often the norm in young Lincoln's America.  Second, he stresses the fact that in the frontier conditions in which Lincoln grew up, ""there was never any measure of private space.""  Lincoln and his family lived in cramped log cabins where ""everyone dressed  --  and undressed  --  in the common space.""  Bodily privacy in such surroundings was an afterthought at best  --  if that.</p>	<p>This is a useful, timely, and thought-provoking book for Lincoln scholars and for general readers.  Strozier is to be commended for producing it.</p><p><i>Richard Striner is a professor of History at Washington College.

6354	9781479826940	$35.00	Clean and White: A History of Environmental Racism in the United States		Zimring, Carl A.			"A Long View of Environmental Racism in the United States<p>From the nation's founding in the eighteenth century to the present, white stereotypes of black bodies as dirty and diseased have formed the ideological basis for all manner of racist policies and practices -- from jobs to housing to public accommodations and more.  Thus argues Carl A. Zimring in <i>Clean and White</i>, a sweeping cultural history of environmental racism in America.   Zimring uses the ""lens of dirt"" (3) to explore the origins and evolution of racist thought and constructions of whiteness in America, and to make the case that environmental factors have played an instrumental role in shaping ideas about race. </p><p>This book joins a growing body of scholarship on the history of environmental racism, which includes important works by Andrew Hurley, Julie Sze, Ellen Griffith Spears, Dorceta E. Taylor, and Robert Bullard, among others.  But unlike previous works, which have tended to adopt a case study approach and focused mainly on pollution and public health, Zimring's book spans the 240-plus years of American history and explores how white people (and people aspiring to become white) came to see black people as a source (rather than a victim) of environmental pollution, and how those racist beliefs became self-fulfilling through discriminatory policies and practices that forced African Americans to live and work in dirty and disease-prone environments. </p><p>Zimring locates the origins of environmental racism in the age of Enlightenment.  He contrasts Thomas Jefferson's idealization of agrarian life with his disparagement of industrializing cities.  An emergent discourse linking hygiene to morality, Zimring argues, became the language through which white Americans formulated ideas about racial difference.  Fears of disease and of black people, he argues, grew more pronounced in the immediate aftermath of the Civil War, a conflict in which disease claimed far more victims on both sides than the battlefield.  White Americans came to view social disorder as equivalent to an infectious disease, one which freedmen and women carried and spread.  As Zimring puts it, ""American concerns about race in the years after the Civil War became enmeshed with ever-growing concerns about waste"" (47). </p> <p>These fears about race and waste, and the threat persons of color posed to the health of the nation, only grew more pronounced in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, as cities struggled to address the unsanitary conditions that high-density populations and polluting industries produced.  The Progressive reforms that emerged, Zimring argues, further linked cleanliness to whiteness, and made racial purity a standard by which European immigrants strove to attain.  The notion that white people were cleaner and purer than persons of color, he argues, made whiteness the ideal European immigrants aspired to and made blackness the contrast by which they gauged their assimilation into American culture.  It served to stigmatize persons of color and justify their relegation to dirty jobs and disease-prone areas of cities.  The pervasiveness of this racialized discourse on cleanliness and filth becomes most evident in early to mid-twentieth century advertising, which deployed racist imagery to sell soap and other cleaning products. </p><p>African American leaders at the time could not escape the pervasive association of black bodies with dirt and disease.  This, Zimring argues, explains the obsession of black educational institutions such as Booker T. Washington's Tuskegee Institute with teaching students proper cleaning and personal grooming habits.  The stakes were, by Zimring's account, high.  These stereotypes formed the basis for discriminatory practices in labor and housing markets.  ""The racial construction of waste,"" Zimring argues, ""informed what work particular Americans performed, where particular Americans lived, and the proximity of waste materials to those work and residential patterns"" (106). </p><p>Perhaps.  The main problem with Zimring's book is that it too often confuses correlation with causation, and assumes that racist ideas about black bodies as dirty and diseased formed the basis for discriminatory hiring practices and segregated housing markets, as opposed to simply providing a rationale for policies and practices that were fundamentally rooted in material interests.  At times the book reads like two parallel histories -- one of anti-black racist ideologies, the other of the struggle to manage urban waste and mitigate the spread of infectious disease -- that are only tangentially related.  Too often, the author fails to convincingly demonstrate the relation between the two. </p><p>That said, the book does provide a wealth of insights into racist ideological formation and its deleterious effects on African Americans' lives and struggle for equality.  This comes through most powerfully in the book's final chapter, on the Memphis sanitation workers' strike that brought Martin Luther King to the city in the spring of 1968.  What began as strike for better pay and improved working conditions, Zimring shows, grew into a larger struggle for the dignity of labor and the rights of all workers to be treated with respect, as captured by the signs marching strikers carried that read: ""I AM A MAN.""  While the Memphis sanitation strike will always be remembered as King's final campaign, it also, Zimring argues, established ""an important precedent for the ways in which environmental racism would be addressed"" in the decades that followed (212).  In the book's final pages, Zimring summarizes the key issues and pivotal moments that have shaped the modern movement for environmental justice, and points the way for future scholars to begin the work of documenting and giving voice to the civil rights struggles of our time. </p><p><i>Andrew W.

6390	9780813935850	$45.00	Slavery and War in the Americas: Race, Citizenship, and State Building in the United States and Brazil, 1861-1870		Izecksohn, Vitor			"A Novel Comparative Perspective on the American Civil War	<p>Placing the American Civil War in its international dimension has now become common in courses, papers, and conferences, thanks to an increasingly larger body of scholarship -- epitomized by Don Doyle, <i>The Cause of All Nations</i> (2015) -- which has emphasized trasnational links and connections between the nineteenth-century U.S.A. and other regions of the world, starting from Europe. Yet, despite the opening of possibilities for the implementation of wider approaches that this important scholarship clearly represents, studies that look at the American Civil War not only transnationally, but also, or especially, through a comparative lens, are still very few, as Peter Kolchin had noted in his seminal <i>A Sphinx on the American Land</i>  (2003). Indeed, aside from articles and chapters by David Potter, Thomas Bender, Carl Degler, and a few other scholars, there is only a handful of examples of comparative histories of the United States in the Civil War Era with other countries in either contemporaneous or different periods. Among the older and more recent studies, particularly worthy of mention are Stig Forster's and Joerg Nagler's edited <i>On the Road to Total War</i>  (1997) on the American Civil War and the Wars for German National Unification, and Paul Escott's <i>Uncommonly Savage</i>  (2014) on the memory and legacy of the American Civil War and of the Spanish Civil War. </p> 	<p>Now, with <i>Slavery and War in the Americas</i>, Vitor Izecksohn has written the first comparative monograph of the United States in the Civil War (1861-65) with another country roughly at the same time, specifically Brazil at the time of the War of the Triple Alliance (1864-70). Izecksohn starts his book by contextualizing his specific study as a comparison of challenges to ""national unity"" and ""internal political cohesion"" faced by the ""Western Hemisphere's two largest countries"" (p. 1), which, in 1860, were also the two largest slaveholding nations: Brazil and the United States. For the sake of consistency, however, we might note that this particular comparison would be reinforced if we considered the American Civil War not as an internecine struggle, but rather as a war between the two nation-states of the Union and the Confederacy, similarly to the War of the Triple Alliance, which was a war between the empire of Brazil and its allies against the republic of Paraguay. Izecksohn never makes this point explicitly, but it is implicit in his treatment, which focuses exclusively on the Union and its policies in comparison with the Brazilian Empire. In the Introduction to the book, in providing the necessary background to those policies in comparative perspective, Izecksohn highlights especially the difference in the approaches to military service -- with its connection to the rights and duties of citizenship in the United States in contrast to its negative and oppressive connotations in Brazil -- and the equally important differences in relation to race and recruitment -- with the high number of free blacks in the Brazilian army in stark contrast with the highly segregated Union army. Despite these clear differences, though, Izecksohn points out, perceptively, that, in both the United States and Brazil, strong traditions of local power were similarly responsible for suspicious attitudes towards any attempt at increasing centralization carried out by the national governments. </p>	<p>Izecksohn, then, provides the core of his analysis in four consecutive chapters, in which the treatment of two specific issues alternate between a chapter on Brazil and a chapter on the United States in an exercise in juxtaposition, more than sustained comparison. The first half of the book includes two chapters that focus on the relationship between the nation-state and the civilian population in the United States and Brazil at the time of the major crisis brought by the American Civil War and the War of the Triple Alliance, specifically through the lens of conscription, which in both cases followed a brief initial phase of enthusiastic voluntary enlistment for the national army. As a result, on one hand, a similar experience of military mobilization forced two decentralized state systems, as both the United States and Brazil were at the start of the two wars, to increase the pace of their centralization. On the other hand, these two parallel processes affected the lives of millions of people in comparable ways, as, both in the Union and in Brazil, resistance to conscription became widespread very rapidly and took several different forms, but, ultimately, ""waging war placed enormous burdens on the poor and unprotected in both countries"" (p. 59). </p> 	<p>Yet, if this is the subject of the comparison drawn in the first half of the book, the subject of the comparison drawn in the second half of the book is even more compelling as a justification for this comparative study. In fact, the following two chapters focus on the crucial issue of how the war necessities led in both cases to a mass recruitment of people of African descent in the nation-state's armed forces, i.e., of both free and enslaved blacks in the Union army and in the Brazilian army. In the Union, the recruitment of African Americans was part of a legislation designed to end slavery, and many of the almost 185,000 black soldiers in the Union army were runaway slaves and freedmen recruited after the 1863 <i>Emancipation Proclamation</i>. Conversely, in Brazil, where already a relatively large number of free blacks were enlisted in the imperial army, slaves were recruited only in times of crisis as during the War of the Triple Alliance; yet, even though the government was willing to free its slaves  to recruit them in the imperial troops, most slaveholders were unwilling to do the same, and the number of recruits remained relatively small, only 4,000. </p> 	<p>Most of all, the effects of these parallel and comparable policies were very different in the two case-studies, especially in terms of the institution of slavery and ongoing perceptions of race and citizenship. Here, to a certain extent at least, Izecksohn follows in the footsteps of illustrious scholars such as Carl Degler, who, in <i>Neither Black Nor White</i> (1971), was the first to compare systematically the historical record on race in the United States and Brazil. However, the fact that Izecksohn focuses exclusively on the Civil War Era United States, rather than providing a long-term perspective, necessarily leads him to opposite conclusions from Degler, according to whom Brazil's looser racial barriers provided more opportunities for social inclusion to blacks there than in the United States. Instead, with regard to the period at the heart of his study, Izecksohn shows how the effects of the American Civil War were immensely beneficial to African Americans in the United States, aside from the momentous change represented by the end of slavery, since recruitment in the Union army provided the first step toward recognition of citizenship rights, in contrast to the continuing presence of slavery and the unchanged status of blacks in Brazil after the War of the Triple Alliance. In the long concluding chapter, which is the most significant part of Izecksohn's book, the author carefully analyses the similarities and differences between his two case-studies in a complex investigation, which is a brilliant example of sustained comparison. Lastly, in reflecting on the wider significance of his comparison, he puts forward an important claim when he states that, if ""we take social and political transformations into account and compare the extent and nature of these transformations, the American Civil War must now be considered a Total War"", while in the case of Brazil with the War of the Triple Alliance, ""changes were more gradual and not as substantial"" (p.171). It is a fitting summary of Izecksohn's innovative comparative study; with his book, he has broken new ground in more than one way, none the least also by utilizing several archival repositories, especially in Brazil, in order to engage fruitfully with this complex and worthwhile comparison. </p><p><i>Enrico Dal Lago is Lecturer in American History at the National University of Ireland, Galway, and author, most recently, of</i> The Age of Lincoln and Cavour: Comparative Perspectives in Nineteenth-Century American and Italian Nation-Building<i> (Palgrave, 2015). </i></p>

Mason, Matthew		A Path to Dissent: John Quincy Adams and the Politics of Slavery  <p>At the outset I want to state that I have recently completed my own study of John Quincy Adams.  It is scheduled for publication this fall with the title <i>The Lost Founding Father: John Quincy Adams and the Transformation of American Politics</i>. While working on my book I spent considerable time with John Quincy's diary both the published version, Charles Francis Adams, editor, <i>The Memoirs of John Quincy Adams, 1795 to 1848</i> (12 vols.; Philadelphia 1874-77) and the much longer manuscript diary that the Massachusetts Historical Society has made available online.  I am pleased to report that Professors Waldstreicher and Mason have also made use of both in preparing this volume. And with it they have performed a real service to historical scholarship.</p> <p>The diary, particularly the Charles Francis Adams edition, is well known to historians.  It has long been a key source for the study of American history from Jefferson's presidency to John Quincy's death in 1848.  John Quincy's relationship to slavery and especially to the politics of slavery provide an excellent vantage point from which to observe and understand how slavery moved from the edge of politics in the early nineteenth century to its central role by the mid 1840s.  Moreover, the diary chronicles John Quincy's depiction of his own journey from a nationalist who never supported slavery but kept his antipathy to it mostly private and subordinate to national goals to a vigorous sectionalist who by the late 1830s became the most important figure in national antislavery politics.</p> <p>I have nothing but praise for <i>John Quincy Adams and the Politics of Slavery</i>. The editors have shown discerning judgment in the material they have chosen for their pages. In a thoughtful and judicious introduction, they have spelled out the historiographical odyssey of the diary as well as the motivation governing Adams's own relations with slavery and the South.  On the latter point they deserve special commendation in a time when many tout John Quincy as an antislavery hero with little thought to the complex road he took to reach that place. In addition, I want to compliment them for recognizing the tangled connections between John Quincy and abolitionists and abolitionism. Furthermore, their comments and notes, which pervade the text, give essential context and clarification for the entries they have included.</p> <p>My only regret is that this volume was not available for me to utilize in my own book. I want to add, however, that almost four decades ago I published a book with the phrase The Politics of Slavery in the title.  I am delighted that the phrase still resonates.

6625	9781469631561	$40.00	Theater of a Separate War: The Civil War West of the Mississippi River, 1861--1865		Cutrer, Thomas W.			"A Region Remembered: Martial Conflict Beyond the Mississippi	<p>Despite the ever-expanding body of literature available today about the Civil War, a vast gap remains unfilled about the Trans-Mississippi theater and the role it played in determining the outcome of the great conflict. In <i>Theater of a Separate War: The Civil War West of the Mississippi River, 1861-1865</i>, Thomas Cutrer offers students of military history an introductory text about the martial aspects of the Trans-Mississippi region. This single volume history is not meant to act as an all-inclusive work on every aspect of the vast region west of the Mississippi; instead, Cutrer offers his reader a detailed yet brief overview of each major battle or campaign within the great expanse of the war's forgotten region. Each chapter stands alone, in essence creating an anthology history of the Theater. Combat in the Indian Territory receives much wanted attention, as does the role of Native peoples within the context of the both sides of the conflict. The one region that receives the most attention is Louisiana, and especially those actions related to the Red River Campaign; Cutrer breaks the campaign into three separate chapters in order to give deeper analysis of Banks' efforts to secure Louisiana for the Union.</p>	<p>The body of the book is expertly crafted and holds the attention of the reader. That cannot be said, however, of the Introduction and Conclusion sections. Both sections contain examples of poor editing which detracts from the overall feel of the work. On page seven, Cutrer writes,		<blockquote>The combat experienced by troops in the trans-Mississippi was     perhaps 	less arduous than that of the Army of Northern Virginia, the Army of the 	Potomac, the Army of Tennessee, or the Army of the Tennessee, but they 	operated efficiently under peculiar difficulties unknown east of the Mississippi,	and deserved major credit for their courage, their perseverance, and their self-	sacrifice. Following the initial enthusiasm for service in Virginia, most trans-	Mississippi soldiers expressed their ardent preference for returning to or	remaining in their home region. Political representatives bitterly resented seeing	their region's resources for defense -- human and material -- requisitioned by the	Davis administration for service east of the river. (7)</blockquote><p>This same material is included nearly verbatim in the final paragraph on page ten.	<blockquote> [. . .] The combat experienced by troops in the trans-Mississippi was 	less arduous than that of the Army of Northern Virginia, the Army of the 	Potomac, the Army of Tennessee, or the Army of the Tennessee.

Political 	representatives bitterly resented seeing their region's resources for 	defense -- human and material -- requisitioned by the Davis administration	for service east of the river. (10)</blockquote><p>The section of paragraph on page ten is then followed by a concluding sentence, which is also repeated verbatim as the first sentence of the paragraph starting on page eleven. </p>	<p>As mentioned, another example, although smaller in magnitude, occurs in the Conclusion. On page 443, Cutrer describes logistics within the theater as being ""at the end of a long and tenuous line of supply . . ."" He recycles that clause closely two paragraphs later on the same page. Here, the Trans-Mississippi is at ""the terminus of a long and tenuous supply line . . ."" (443)</p>	<p>These examples do not detract from the research used for the rest throughout the rest of the book. Unfortunately, they do call into question the editing done within the volume, as well as the work done in the writing of what are traditionally seen as the final portions of a project committed to paper. All readers and writers understand that word choice and editing provide a substantial challenge throughout the creative process. Letting such egregious examples pass through to the final volume reflect poorly upon not just the author, but upon the University of North Carolina Press as well.</p>	<p>For those looking for an entry point into the military actions of the Trans-Mississippi theater, the flaws should not prove to be a major distraction. This is a serviceable volume for just such a task, which is what Cutrer claims it to be. For those seeking a deeper dive into various battles of the Far West, this book also provides an introduction to available sources and the materials necessary to further investigate battles fought in that mysterious theater beyond the Great River. </p><p><i>Robert Welch is an adjunct instructor within the South Dakota Board of Regents system.

6460	9780691169408	$35.00	A Savage War: A Military History of the Civil War		Murray, William	Wei-Siang Hsieh, Wayne		"A Savage War and the Foundations of American Military Power	<p>Iis nearly a truism that the American Civil War attracts more writers and readers than any event in United States history. Amateur ""historians,"" professional scholars, veterans, social commentators, and journalists have produced some 50,000 volumes or pamphlets, at least one book per day, since 1861. America's addiction to ""the crossroads of our being"" perpetuates an immense historiography. In one of the most recent additions to Civil War literature, titled <i>A Savage War: A Military History of the Civil War</i> (2016), two military historians argue in support of the war's contribution to a uniquely American way of war (1,11-12). For Williamson Murray and Wayne Wei-Siang Hsieh, the Civil War represents the first major event in which the confluence of the Industrial, French, and military revolutions affected the conduct and policies of a nation at war. Out of civil conflict, the United States fashioned a way of war that projected military might over continental and global distances with resolute force.</p>	<p><i>A Savage War</i> represents a synthesis of military, political, and cultural histories; it draws heavily from scholarship of the past two decades, including James McPherson's <i>Battle Cry of Freedom</i>, while retaining some measure of originality. The book is largely chronological, touching on the causes of the war then following the harrowing conflict through Appomattox and the beginning of Reconstruction. At times the authors diverge from chronology and commit a chapter to a thematic concern, like joint operations in Chapter 5. Though intimidating, this 600-page study reads with ease and clarity. Murray's and Hsieh's treatment of complex strategy and operations makes this military history accessible to anyone. They also strike an impressive balance of examining larger concepts, like the creation of unique army cultures or logistical innovations, and delving into battlefield tactics.</p>  	<p>What this volume lacks in depth, it accounts for in scope and creativity. Hsieh and Murray offer fresh interpretations of grand strategy, politics, and operations that have long rested at the center of historical debate. One of these interpretations includes an assertion that the first year of the war politically and strategically favored the United States. From the firing on Fort Sumter through the summer of 1862, the Confederacy enjoyed a series of battlefield successes. Nevertheless, President Jefferson Davis and other Confederate officials made crucial strategic mistakes that eventually would cost them time and resources that they could ill afford to waste. The most disastrous of these proved to be the South's intransigent focus on the eastern theater of operations. As a result, the Lincoln Administration and the United States military exploited the Confederacy's mistakes and successes of 1861 to attack the river systems in the West, adjust to the embarrassment of Bull Run, and keep Europe out of the war. These decisions laid the foundation for eventual Union victory.</p>  	<p><i>A Savage War</i>'s driving argument is that the United States won the Civil War through its efforts in the western theater. After a series of leadership blunders, indecisive operations, and embarrassing defeats in 1862, the United States turned 1863 into the decisive year of the war, principally with Grant's victories at Vicksburg and Chattanooga. Despite the popular argument that the Confederate victory at Chickamauga represented a northern setback, Murray and Hsieh contend that this southern ""triumph"" was a strategic defeat, or at best a pyrrhic victory, because it further shifted the North's attention westward. Once fully invested in the West, the United States launched the conclusive campaign of the war under General William T. Sherman in 1864. The capture of Atlanta by September of 1864 secured Abraham Lincoln's second-term election, and Sherman's campaign to Savannah and into South Carolina wrought devastation upon the South. Murray and Hsieh argue that the hard war policies of 1864-1865 secured victory for the United States and demonstrated a uniquely American form of war, characterized by a relentless projection of military power over great distances.</p>  	<p>Another great strength of this work is its clarification of the war's cause and its dismissal of popular myths which have long betrayed the historical record and distracted from the war's resonance in our own time. In the chapter on ""Origins,"" Hsieh and Murray establish that the unequivocal, overarching cause of hostilities was the institution of chattel slavery. Without diverging from their central themes and arguments, the authors make a series of literary gestures to historians of southern memory, praising their efforts to toss the argument of ""states' rights"" into the ""garbage dump"" (11,522-25). They contend that <i>A Savage Wa</i> will help to further diminish the remnants of Lost Cause mythology that <i>still</i> inform popular understandings of the Civil War.</p>   	<p>Despite the merits of this study, <i>A Savage War</i> is not without shortcomings. The most glaring flaw is the authors' meager discussion of emancipation. As Hsieh and Murray illustrate, myriad factors contributed to the flow and tempo of the war. Union victory and Confederate defeat weighed heavily upon the outcomes of military and political leadership, battlefield success, and skillful diplomacy. But the key to understanding Union victory is recognizing that emancipation was the decisive political strategy of the war. The Emancipation Proclamation, paired with the inclusion of black men (former slaves and free men of color) into the United States military, aimed to disrupt the South's center of gravity and to force the Confederate Government to commit to a war for slavery's survival. Though the authors mention the Emancipation Proclamation in passing and seldom comment on the USCT regiments, there is no thorough discussion of emancipation's role in the war. </p>  	<p>Beyond the preceding foible, <i>A Savage War</i> represents a fine military study. Hsieh and Murray illuminate the broader political and cultural forces that shaped the war's course while also giving due credit to the impact of contingency and human action. The confluence of the these forces, decisions, and actions helped to form an American way of war, one principally characterized by resolute military force projected over vast distances. This way of war followed the United States military through the 20th century and informs the war-fighting methods of the armed forces today. <i>A Savage War</i> will appeal to both academic and popular audiences with its resonance, accessible prose, and fresh treatment of the events that still captivate America's public consciousness over 150 years later.</p><p><i>Lt.

6512	9780813939186	$45.00	War Upon Our Border: Two Ohio Valley Communities Navigate the Civil War		Rockenbach, Stephen			"A Tale of Two Towns	<p>This study of the Civil War in Corydon, Indiana, and Frankfort, Kentucky, originated as a University of Cincinnati doctoral dissertation approved by a stellar committee whose members personify the historiographical literatures that Stephen I. Rockenbach engages. The thesis director was Christopher Phillips, the leading explicator of the impact of the Civil War on regional identity in the Middle Border. Another advisor was Wayne K. Durrill, author of the first important Civil War community study to take a place on the shelf filled out over the last twenty years by works from Edward Ayers, Martin Crawford, Nicole Etcheson, Jonathan Dean Sarris, and other scholars. Legal historian Linda Przybyszewski began her distinguished career with an examination of the racial and political ideology of <i>Plessy v. Ferguson</i> dissenter John Marshall Harlan, the most prominent public figure to emerge from Civil War Frankfort. (Walter Q. Gresham would hold that distinction for Corydon.) The final member of the team, outstanding military historian Mark Grimsley, provided expertise in the extensive scholarship on guerrilla warfare and Union ""hard war"" policies. Rockenbach's resulting book will be welcomed by research specialists in each of these fields.</p>	<p>Rockenbach's selection of his focal communities is elegant. He underscores his central argument that the antebellum Ohio River Valley was a harmonious region despite the pressures of sectional politics by choosing two towns on almost exactly the same latitude. His northern pendant is actually located slightly to the south of his southern pendant, but mostly Corydon is about seventy-eight miles due west of Frankfort. That distance permits some direct interactions between the communities, but Rockenbach describes inland rural nodes in a complex network rather than a narrow binary. Corydon communicates with the Ohio River through the waterfront towns of Mauckport, Indiana, and Brandenburg, Kentucky, and the more substantial commercial center of New Albany, Indiana. The major city of Louisville lies about a third of the way from Corydon and Frankfort, and its influence radiates westward and eastward.  Both communities were the scene of brief but locally significant military action. Confederate troops commanded by Braxton Bragg occupied Frankfort for a month in fall 1862; Confederate raiders led by John Hunt Morgan sacked Corydon in July 1863. Particularly interesting is the contrast between the capital forsaken by Indiana in 1825 and the capital permanently established by Kentucky in 1792. Rockenbach describes Corydon and much of the southern tier of the state as frequently alienated from Indianapolis and the Great Lakes economy beyond. Frankfort reflected the fissures of its diverse state.</p>	<p>The heart of the duality is of course that Corydon was a non-slaveholding community and Frankfort was a slaveholding community that remained in the Union. Before the war the exclusionary racism of southern Indiana complemented the regime of bondage in Kentucky. That solidarity persisted for a while. Early recruitment efforts reached across state lines, though Rockenbach wryly notes that many of his Kentuckians ""chose to follow a policy of individual neutrality"" even after state neutrality failed, as only 9.4% of white men of military age in Franklin County enlisted in the Confederate army and 12.5% in the Union army (56).  But over the course of the war Ohio River Valley unity collapsed. Economic dislocations and security anxieties that peaked together in Morgan's raid caused Corydon to turn inward, sometimes in local conflict. The murder of the provost marshal during the summer 1864 draft dramatized these tensions. Frankfort experienced a more marked transformation after the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation, even though Lincoln's policy did not apply to Kentucky. Recruitment of black soldiers became a powerful force in the breakdown of the slave order. Union supporters increasingly tended to equate slaveholding and disloyalty. White Frankforters desperate to hold onto slavery bitterly resented Stephen G. Burbridge's and John M. Palmer's administration of the Department of Kentucky. As deserters came home from the failing Confederate army, they found fertile soil for intensification of guerrilla activities in and around Franklin County. Rockenbach concludes that ""the Civil War not only reshaped communities such as Frankfort and Corydon, it broke up the Ohio Valley as an economic, social, and political borderland, making the Ohio River the newly established boundary between the North and the South"" (173).</p> 	<p>After a simple schematic map in the first chapter, the only illustrations in War Upon Our Borders are a panoramic map of Frankfort in 1871 and a bird's-eye-view postcard of Corydon in the early twentieth century. The distant, elevated perspectives of these images aptly correspond to the long-term white romanticization of the war Rockenbach finds in both towns and contrasts with the monument that African Americans in Frankfort dedicated in Green Hill Cemetery on July 4, 1924, to honor black Union soldiers from the area. The book is a ground-level view drawn mostly from newspapers, official documents, and some family papers. The study confirms that the Civil War was a crisis not only for the nation but also for local communities.</p><p><i>Thomas J.

6394	9780806153834	$34.95	Powder River: Disastrous Opening of the Great Sioux War		Hedren, Paul L.			"A Timeless Disaster Carefully Revisted	<p>In this first book length treatment of the March 1876 Powder River fight since J.W. Vaughn's <i>The Reynolds Campaign on Powder River</i> (1961), retired National Park Superintendent Paul Hedren builds on his earlier treatment of the Sioux War's causes and effects, most notably in <i>Ho! For the Black Hills:  Captain Jack Crawford Reports the Black Hills Gold Rush and the Great Sioux War</i> (2012) and <i>After Custer:  Loss and Transformation in Sioux Country</i> (2011).  His contribution is a judicious use of sources not available to Vaughn, including a detailed after action report by army surgeon Curtis Munn, various Sioux and Northern Cheyenne accounts unknown to Vaughn in pre-internet times, and a file of Adjutant General's Office administrative records relating to the three consequent courts martial.  But while <i>Powder River</i> sheds light on the Sioux War's first and least appreciated chapter, it does so without refuting the generally accepted view:  For the United States, this particular battle was an unexpectedly bad start to an inevitable confrontation. </p>	<p>Thanks to Vaughn, the general outlines have been well enough known, and Hedren avoids re-telling what has already been told well enough:  Acting on the orders of Philip Sheridan, commanding general of the Military Department of the Missouri, George Crook, commanding the Military Department of the Platte, ordered elements of the Second and Third Cavalry Regiments to force recalcitrant Sioux and Northern Cheyenne bands onto reservations where Red Cloud and others had already relocated.  Launching a winter campaign under harsh conditions, Crook led ten companies north from Fort Fetterman on 1 March in search of non-treaty Sioux, believed to be encamped somewhere on the Powder River, location unknown.  After only twenty-nine miles, Indians drove off the accompanying cattle herd, putting the entire expedition on short rations.  Two weeks later as those rations were running low, Crook's scouts located Old Bear's Northern Cheyenne band in a village on the Powder River (mistakenly identified at the time as Crazy Horse's village).  Keeping 300 troops and the field trains with himself, Crook directed Colonel Joseph Reynolds of the Third Cavalry to take the remainder, destroy the village, confiscate supplies, and capture as many ponies as possible.  Reynolds' background bore significantly on his appointment by Crook, not so much because this was the same Reynolds who had commanded one of Thomas's divisions during Longstreet's breakthrough at Chickamauga, but because Ranald McKenzie of the Fourth Cavalry had more recently accused him of fraud in the handling of government contracts.  Drawing on Bourke's <i>On the Border with Crook</i> (1891), Hedren maintains the conventionally accepted view that Crook's choice of Reynolds was intended to repair the latter's reputation and that Reynolds, despite his fifty-three years and an inguinal hernia that made him unfit for the campaign, embraced the opportunity. </p>	<p>The result on St. Patrick's Day morning 1876 was a poorly coordinated assault that allowed all but four hostiles to escape.  The village finally secured, Colonel Reynolds then ordered his own starving and frostbitten troopers to destroy the massive quantities of meat and buffalo robes they so desperately needed, against Crook's orders.  They also captured 700 war ponies, but Reynolds failed to secure the herd and all but fifty were back in Indian hands after two days.  Worst of all, Reynolds ordered several dead and one wounded soldier left behind. </p>	<p>Postponed until the conclusion of the 1876 campaigns and thus conducted after Custer's defeat at the Little Bighorn, the trials of Reynolds and two of his battalion commanders drew mixed reactions from their contemporaries:  surprise that the accused's connections in Washington did not save them, but satisfaction that a general court martial had addressed some glaring examples of failed leadership.  While allowing that the verdicts may have been tainted by persons more interested in restoring the Army's damaged reputation than justice for the defendants, Hedren scrupulously avoids guessing as to the degree.  He is more definite in his assertions that one of the trials, that of Captain Henry Noyes (3rd Battalion) was unnecessary and, more notably, that prejudicial pretrial publicity attended the Reynolds case.  Accounts leaked to the <i>New York Tribune</i> by the expedition's paymaster brought the paymaster a reprimand even though the court found Reynolds guilty of three charges.  Hedren also allows that the release of Frederick Whittaker's hagiographical <i>A Complete Life of Gen. George A. Custer</i> several months earlier, and a review of it in the December 1876 <i>Army and Navy Journal</i> that blamed Custer's subordinates, may have influenced officers at the Reynolds court martial. </p>	<p>Fortunately, detailed coverage of the trials does not obscure the Powder River action's more far-reaching effects.  By emboldening the Sioux and involving the Northern Cheyenne, it not only led to the Seventh Cavalry's destruction in June, but exhausted elements of the Second and Third, whose troopers then deserted at unprecedented rates because of Reynolds' proven disregard for their welfare.  That said, the trials and subsequent recriminations are this campaign's distinctive feature and occupy a full third of the text.  And while one might consider prejudicial a reference on p. xiii to Reynolds' ""constant bickering ever after, "" the author supports any negative assessments of Reynolds and his subordinates thoroughly.  He rehabilitates no one and demonstrates that Reynolds indeed lost control of the operation, lied about ordering a wounded man left behind, and took not the least precaution to secure the captured ponies.  That he treats such inexcusable mistakes without making the fog of war seem any less real is perhaps the book's greatest strength.  Rule number one, then and now, is that things will go wrong in combat no matter who is in charge. </p>	<p>Readers might also notice that Reynolds' biggest tactical mistake -- trusting his least reliable battalion commander with the greatest degree of independence -- violated no article of war.  Captain Alexander Moore, the other battalion commander to be court martialed, had served with Crook in a recent campaign against the Apaches, during which Crook had suspected him of cowardice and then oddly refrained from pressing charges.  Hedren's account of the Powder River action five years later hints that perhaps he should have; that Moore's appointment to battalion command, like Crook's appointment of Reynolds, had been an unwarranted favor given not because of, but despite a reputation.  On 17 March 1876, Moore's 5th Battalion was to close a likely escape route at the far end of Old Bear's village, but was at least 800 yards out of position when the action commenced.  Having failed to spring the trap, Moore then ordered his troops to open fire on the village from too great a range, endangering friendly forces without inflicting any casualties on the enemy.  Like Reynolds and Noyes, he received a light sentence, but a permanent stain on his record. </p>	<p>Because of the Powder River disaster's timing and Commanding General William T. Sherman's aversion to negative publicity, Crook never faced a court martial of his own, and therein lies this story's loosest loose end.  Self-serving though it was, Reynolds's fifty-six page statement to the court raises legitimate questions -- the same questions that will likely have crossed the reader's mind well before Hedren raises them.  Why did Crook keep two fifths of his combat strength with him instead of committing more to the assault?  Why did Crook keep the trains with himself if the capture of provisions was so important?  And, having decided to split his command, why did Crook keep his four companies far enough from Reynolds that mutual support was impossible?  All of this Crook ordered, even though he knew that Reynolds was new to Indian fighting.  That Crook was apparently betting the lives of his men so that Reynolds and Moore could restore their reputations seems neither professional nor well timed.  In the end, however, Reynolds' flawed conduct of the battle not only made him more expendable to his contemporaries, but has disqualified him as a witness to his superior's mistakes ever since.	<p>Hedren includes enough of Sherman's endorsement and Crook's testimony to frame this unsolved problem.  While confirming Reynolds' conviction and eschewing any proceedings against Crook, Sherman nevertheless noted that Crook should not have divided his command.  Nor does Crook's own testimony, quoted on p. 291, make him look any less culpable:  ""[I]f I had not preferred charges against [Reynolds], ""said Crook, ""I would be held responsible and I did not propose to take the responsibility. ""  As a military professional, General Crook must have known that he could only delegate authority -- not responsibility -- and that he was ultimately responsible for anything that those under his command, including Reynolds, did or failed to do. </p>	<p>As the expedition's ranking officer, Crook was also responsible for its logistics, which would have been problematic even if Reynolds' command had taken some food and robes from Old Bear's village.  As Reynolds noted, Crook had kept the field trains with himself on the day of the battle.  The early loss of the beef supply and consequent short rations also would have kept the campaign's logistical tether near the breaking point regardless of what happened once the shooting started.  A properly supported campaign in Wyoming and Montana Territories required a supply point considerably closer to the action than that which Crook used, but impatience in Washington would have made sufficient preparation impossible in any case.  Indeed, it is the false assumptions and missteps of superiors -- all noted by the author -- that allow the reader to place Reynolds' failures in their proper perspective.  If, as noted on p. 343, Reynolds ""weaseled"" when lying under oath, Crook's equally disingenuous escape from what should have been an equally tight spot deserves an equally loaded verb. </p><p><i>A former armor officer, John Daley teaches the military history courses at Pittsburg State University in southeastern Kansas.</i></p>

6333	9780674047846	$29.95	The Banjo: America\'s African Instrument		Dubois, Laurent			"A Transnational Look at the Banjo <p>""A national music is the spontaneous growth of ages of insulated life and feeling,"" said Christopher Pearce Cranch to the Harvard Music Association in 1846. ""It is impossible that American music can do more than reproduce the music of other ages""We are too much a nation of others."" Throughout American history men and women have sought to locate national characteristics in music. In Cranch's Transcendentalist circle, those like Margaret Fuller upheld the music of indigenous communities and the enslaved as distinctly American. Meanwhile Cranch and famous music critic Theodore Dwight more often looked to Western musical traditions as the best standard of measure. In <i>The Banjo: America's African Instrument</i>, distinguished Atlantic historian Laurent Dubois offers a thoroughly modern take on an age-old theme. The banjo has been called ""America's Instrument"" and Dubois locates such Americanism in the cultural processes of cooperation, appropriation, and transformation. He argues that a national instrument -- and by extension a national sound -- developed not from insularity, but from an incredible mixture of peoples and classes found within the greater Atlantic world. </p><p>Dubois traces the origins of the banjo from the variety of lutes and harps found in ancient Egypt as well as in Spain and northern, western, and central Africa in the Middle Ages. The record of such instruments is admittedly sparse, but through the use of an impressive array of visual, textual, and material sources <i>The Banjo</i> highlights a vibrant fusion of musical cultures. However the ""cross-pollination"" between European and African musicians was removed from many written accounts starting in the fifteenth century. (23) A market in individuals from the African continent fostered the erasure: ""The belief in racial and cultural difference was both sustained and reinforced by the new interaction between the continents"".the slave trade."" (29) </p> <p>In ports and cities from Cuba and Brazil to Haiti and Louisiana a cohesive African identity was forged for the first time. Enslavers were slow to recognize regional, lingual, or cultural differences among their slaves. They understood the diverse peoples from whom they profited more readily as African. The name of a continent came to represent a nationalism that had not yet developed. Enslaved individuals in search of ways to bear the traumatic dislocation and violence of the slave trade often found solace or at least forbearance in music and dance. The banjo proved central to this tradition and ""it was the first African instrument."" (52) </p><p>Dubois situates the banjo as the creolized product of the Atlantic slave trade -- this is a strength of the book. The reader tours the complicated force of music and dance as a means of resistance and persistence by enslaved men and women in Guadeloupe and Martinique, Jamaica, and, in North America, New York. The vivid depictions of banjo performance lead to questions on the performative aspect of enslavement. From slave ships where the crew demanded women dance and men sing to plantations where masters and mistresses commanded concerts on demand (think of the recent film depiction of fiddle playing and dance in Steve McQueen's <i>Twelve Years a Slave</i>) the performance that accompanied human enslavement has yet to receive a full exploration. Here Dubois acknowledges the longstanding debate among white observers on whether banjo performance among the enslaved indicated contentment, disappointment, or defiance. How performance served the relationships of power between enslaver and enslaved deserves a more thorough assessment. </p>  <p>As one of the greatest slave societies in human history, the nineteenth-century United States was unavoidably influenced by the practice of black human enslavement. And the deeper Atlantic context provided by Dubois begins to chip away at the most complex cultural riddle in American history: the development and outsized support for blackface minstrels between 1830 and 1850. What happened when the performance of the enslaved moved to the cultural marketplace?  Dubois largely turns away from the global interactions that mark the opening of the book toward more traditional explanations for the minstrel phenomenon. It was a combination of adoration and appropriation by white Americans (""love and theft"" to use the words of Eric Lott). Working class men and women recognized their street culture -- their street music -- in the sounds of the banjo. Racism was important too. Of course no less an expert on American enslavement than Frederick Douglass was also confused by minstrelsy. He once accused white performers who blacked their faces and played instruments such as the banjo as ""the filthy scum of white society who have stolen from us a complexion denied to them by nature."" Four years later, in 1852, he changed his mind. ""We have allies in the Ethiopian songs,"" he said. ""They awaken the sympathies for the slave, in which anti-slavery principles take root, grow and flourish."" </p><p>Douglass, like most individuals of the antebellum United States, was torn by the fast-pace of change. The commercialization of culture, in particular music, was one such transformation. A market revolution that connected North Americans to regions and nations near and far wrought consequences that historians have yet to fully unpack. The centrality of white consumers to cultural performance profoundly shaped the sounds heard on stage. Industrialization, which altered the very process of banjo making, was important too. And what should we make of the college banjo orchestras whose players often dressed in all white? At the same time, the emancipation of slaves in the Americas in the nineteenth century no doubt had important ramifications for banjo performance throughout the Atlantic world. For the most part Dubois leaves such material for another day. He opts instead to take the reader to the twentieth century where Appalachians and Civil Rights musicians continued to change the meanings and purposes of the banjo. </p>  <p>In this book Dubois offers readers a rich look into an archive of instruments and performances that expands our understandings of slave culture, American music, and the processes of acculturation. It is a wonderful addition to the literature and will cultivate interest beyond the confines of undergraduate and graduate classrooms. </p>    <p><i>Scott Gac is an Associate Professor of American Studies and History at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, where he serves as the Graduate Director of American Studies.

6621	9780674976290	$39.95	The Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant: The Complete Annotated Edition		Grant, Ulysses S.	Marszalek, John F		"A Valuable Addition: The Annotated Edition of U.S. Grant's Memoirs<p>In July 1861, Colonel Ulysses S. Grant ""received orders to move against Colonel Thomas Harris, who was said to be encamped at the little town of Florida"" where Harris was collecting rebel volunteers from among the local Missourians. Grant's response to the prospect of an engagement against Colonel Harris is instructive. Grant confessed, ""While preparations for the move were going on I felt quite comfortable; but when we got on the road...I was anything but easy."" Marching through ominously empty countryside, Grant grew anxious. ""As we approached the brow of the hill from which it was expected we could see Harris\' camp, and possibly find his men ready formed to meet us, my heart kept getting higher and higher until it felt to me as though it was in my throat."" He confessed, ""I would have given anything then to have been back in Illinois, but I had not the moral courage to halt and consider what to do; I kept right on."" (174)</p><p>It is hard to believe that Grant's courage was ever in question, since ""I kept right on"" was a phrase so characteristic of Grant's life that it could have been his epitaph. As it turned out, Harris and his soldiers were gone when the Federals arrived, and, wrote Grant, ""My heart resumed its place."" But whether he was advancing on Harris; straining to find a way into Vicksburg; pushing the Army of the Potomac onto the road south after the inconclusive battle in the Wilderness; or completing his memoirs, Grant's persistence once he started down a road was one of the key attributes that led Lincoln to him after so many disappointing commanders were tried and found wanting.</p><p>Grant recognized this aspect of his character and admitted that ""One of my superstitions had always been when I started to go any where, or to do anything, not to turn back, or stop until the thing intended was accomplished. I have frequently started to go to places where I had never been and to which I did not know the way, depending upon making inquiries on the road, and if I got past the place without knowing it, instead of turning back, I would go on until a road was found turning in the right direction, take that, and come in by the other side."" (30) What his wife, Julia Dent Grant, thought of this trait aside, Grant's memoir is an impressive bit of evidence that this attribute shaped his actions to his very last days on earth. Faced with financial disaster and determined to improve his family's fortunes despite being confronted by an enemy he could not defeat, Grant kept right on.</p><p>Thankfully, Professor John F. Marszalek, the executive director and managing editor of the U. S. Grant Presidential Library at Mississippi State University, has displayed a similar dedication in completing this new and extensively annotated edition of Grant's <i>Memoirs</i>. A prolific author and the W. L. Giles Distinguished Professor of History Emeritus, Marszalek, with David S. Nolen and Louie P. Gallo, has produced a worthy capstone to compliment the now completed thirty-two volume <i>The Papers of Ulysses S. Grant</i> and the recent opening of the Ulysses S. Grant Presidential Library at Mississippi State University in Starkville, MS.</p><p>This edition comes at a time when there appears to be considerable interest in U. S. Grant. In the last two years, Ron Chernow's 2017 biography, <i>Grant</i>, has joined Ronald C. White's <i>American Ulysses: A Life of Ulysses S. Grant</i> (2016). Both of these works join the large collection of older biographies like Lloyd Lewis's and Bruce Catton's three-volume series on Grant (<i>Captain Sam Grant</i> (1950), <i>Grant Moves South</i> (1960), and <i>Grant Takes Command</i> (1968) and William McFeely's <i>Grant: A Biography</i> (1982), to mention only a handful.</p><p>Marszalek, et. al., have done a thorough job in annotating Grant's text. They provide a biographic note to nearly every individual mentioned by Grant, and also identify many geographic locations more completely. They also correct dates and casualty figures and similar items where that is necessary. One very convenient feature in this edition is its use of footnotes instead of endnotes. No doubt publishers preferred endnotes in the past as a way to simplify the process of printing, something modern software has hopefully eliminated, but readers prefer the convenience of footnotes to being forced to search in the back of the book for the reference or annotation. Additionally, the references in this edition to Grant's collected papers (<i>PUSG</i>) provide the reader with everything needed to interface smoothly with the Ulysses S. Grant Presidential Library's online digital version, a welcome feature for readers who read the book with a computer nearby. </p><p>One objection the reader might have with this edition is the editorial decision to eliminate the maps. As the editors note, ""Because the original maps...are not clear and thus not helpful to the reader, the editors do not include them in the text."" (xxviii) That is unfortunate, since the most valuable addition to any history of military campaigning after good clear prose is a good map. If the original maps were unclear -- and they can confuse because of the level of detail they contain -- perhaps simplified maps could have been substituted. Alternatively, where maps were removed from the text, the editors might have inserted a footnote to direct the reader to related maps in the collected papers. These are available online, and it would seem to be no more difficult to add this information in a note than the other references to Grant's papers. Maps must be a necessary part of a text like this.</p><p>Marszalek like other historians remarks on Grant's modesty, writing that ""What made the <i>Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant</i> particularly appealing to readers was Grant's humility about himself and his infrequent criticism of others."" (xxii) Certainly, Grant's humility contrasts agreeably with Maj. Gen. George McClellan's arrogance, but modesty was not the source of Grant's success on the battlefield. There, it was his tenacity and his willingness and ability to fight with cold-blooded effectiveness that distinguished him. These are not qualities emphasized in the Memoirs, but the perceptive reader will keep them in mind. They are, after all, the qualities Lincoln sought out and eventually found in Grant.</p><p>In January 1863, Lincoln wrote to Maj. Gen. Joe Hooker, that ""I have heard...of your recently saying that both the Army and the Government needed a Dictator."" Noting that ""Only those generals who gain successes, can set up dictators,"" Lincoln continued, ""What I now ask of you is military success, and I will risk the dictatorship."" In contrast, Grant -- a modest killer -- gave Lincoln the victories without the fear of dictatorship. Readers of this well-constructed and highly recommended edition of Grant's Memoirs will not fail to appreciate the man's modesty, but they should also keep in mind that under that modesty lay a cold-blooded willingness to keep right on.</p><p><i>Larry A.

6413	9780813938745	$49.50	The Risen Phoenix: Black Politics in the Post-Civil War South		Dinnella-Borrego, Luis-Alejandro			"A Welcome New Work on Reconstruction's Black Congressmen<p>As we approach the 150th anniversary of Reconstruction,  Risen Phoenix is a timely new exploration of the careers of six black congressmen from that era.  While Phillip Dray's <i>Capitol Men</i> recounted the lives of all the black congressmen from the era, the author has chosen to cover only six of these men.  They are: John Mercer Langston of Virginia, George Henry White of North Carolina, Robert Smalls of South Carolina, Josiah Thomas Walls of Florida,  James T. Rapier of Alabama, and John Roy Lynch of Mississippi.  The author chose these congressmen for their diverse backgrounds which he felt reflected better the broad spectrum of the black community.   Four were born into slavery.   Two were Civil War veterans.  Three had formal educations.  In fact, Langston founded Howard Law School.  The author describes his work as biographical but the sketches of the men's lives outside of politics are so brief as to make the reader beg for more information.   However, this really is not a biographical work and as the author points there are more complete biographies that should be consulted.   This is a political history told through the work of these congressmen. </p>                         <p>The author explores these men's political careers to offer insight into the both the Reconstruction era and the 25 years of Jim Crow that followed.  He uses a combination of political, gender and race history to argue that these men effectively represented both their voters back home and the greater African American community.  The author does an admirable job of demonstrating their advocacy for civil rights from the floor of the House of Representatives and in the broader world.   His use of their participations in peoples' conventions enriches the  story. I do think the author could have provided more information on constituent service. Their efforts to obtain government jobs for African American back home would have added a level of effectiveness that the author misses. </p>          <p>I believe the strength of this book lays in Part III which the author entitles ""The Changing of the Guard.""  His exploration of Fusion, emigration, and the coming of Jim Crow is both readable and educational. His treatment of the divergence and convergence of fusion politics in some states, the Readjuster movement in Virginia and the Populist party in other states is most insightful.  The period from 1876 to 1900 is obviously much longer than the 10-12 years of Reconstruction.  The changing of the guard and ultimately the full demise of this black leadership is a compelling story told well by the author. The author's major point is the fact that these men continued to advocate for civil rights despite the rampant racist violence coupled with disenfranchisement that they faced. </p>    <p>I do wish the author had explored the careers of other black congressmen.  For example, South Carolina had three black congressmen after Reconstruction.  He mentions Thomas Miller but says nothing about George Washington Murray whose support for voting rights litigation nearly prevented the disenfranchisement of many black voters.  While more historical work is needed on this era, the author has made a substantial contribution to the scholarship.</p><p>W.

6522	9781621902362	$60.00	Dismantling Slavery: Frederick Douglass, William Lloyd Garrison, and Formation of the Abolitionist Discourse, 1841-1851		Anadolu-Okur, Nilg�n			"Abolitionism's Allure<p>Nilgün Anadolu-Okur, a scholar of African American literature at Temple University, examines a decade-long partnership between two leading lights of the American abolitionist movement, Frederick Douglass and William Lloyd Garrison, culminating in their falling-out in 1851. She argues that the rhetoric of these two men shaped American literary and political discourses in the nineteenth century. <i>Dismantling Slavery</i> describes how the friendship between Douglass and Garrison gave focus and inspiration to antislavery activism and helped connect abolitionists to other protest movements and cultural developments of the day. Anadolu-Okur offers thoughtful analysis of abolitionist discourse, such as her engaging readings of Elizabeth Barrett Browning's antislavery poetry and her intriguing glimpses at the Africanist elements in Frederick Douglass's writings and speeches. The body of the book draws on a wide array of primary and secondary source material in order to sketch significant events and people in abolitionist history. In addition to describing the formation and dissolution of the alliance between Douglass and Garrison, the five chapters of the book give particular attention to the abolitionist movement's discourses on democracy, its relationship to women's rights activism, and its connections to nineteenth-century protest literature.</p> <p>The book makes ambitious claims for the utmost importance of the alliance between Garrison and Douglass in the 1840s. Anadolu-Okur contends that, after the friendship between the two men soured in the early 1850s, ""the main focus of the [abolitionist] movement was dissolved"". Stakeholders crowded abolition halls and scrambled back and forth without a sense of direction. Abolition's golden vessel had lost its rudder in a violent storm"" (p. 256). Abolitionists certainly faced their share of challenges in the 1850s, including the enforcement of the nefarious Fugitive Slave Act and the violence of Bleeding Kansas. But far from being rudderless in this crucial decade, the period was marked by the strengthening of both political abolitionism and the movement's revolutionary strand (developments in which Douglass himself played no small part). Readers interested in understanding these developments, as well as their roots in the earlier history of antislavery activism, would do well to consult Manisha Sinha's magisterial <i>The Slave's Cause: A History of Abolition</i> (2016).</p><p>Anadolu-Okur extends her claim about Douglass and Garrison's absolute centrality to contend that without this pair, the movement would have lacked ""an intense, and multidimensional outlook"" and would have been unable to ""direct the public's attention to constitutional rights which lay at the heart of American democratic principles including equality, liberty, freedom of speech, right to dissent and protest, advocacy for women's rights, disenfranchisement, and suffrage"" (p. 257). There's no question that an American abolitionism absent Douglass and Garrison would have looked very different from the abolitionist movement in which they played such vital roles. But in stressing this duo's singularity, Anadolu-Okur skirts the richness and complexity of a movement that extended well beyond these two luminaries. Indeed, her argument is undermined by the impressive volume of evidence she presents in the body of the book. The chapter on ""Prose, Politics, and Poetry"" is organized into very loosely linked capsule biographies of fifteen other abolitionists or fellow travelers, ranging from Ralph Waldo Emerson to Frances Ellen Watkins Harper to Theodore Dwight Weld. The chapters on democracy and women's rights discuss still other prominent nineteenth-century reformers. Garrison and Douglass often seem tangential in Anadolu-Okur's lengthy discussions of other reformers. Taken together, then, these chapters do not provide the evidence and reasoning to substantiate the counterfactual claim that abolitionism would have been a lackluster and narrow discourse without Garrison and Douglass.</p><p>In her introduction, Anadolu-Okur describes her project's evolution: ""whereas I began with the prospect of focusing on works before mine as analytical springboards, I eventually sought to identify and reconstruct a separate pathway to contextualize the literary streams that filled the well of abolitionist discourse"" (p. 22). This decision to bypass a thorough review of the relevant historiography was a missed opportunity, as the recent scholarship on abolitionism is deep and rich. Anadolu-Okur's bibliography is extensive, but it does not include the most relevant and up-to-date works that might have significantly enhanced her project. Given her focus on what she variably calls a ""friendship"" or ""alliance"" between Garrison and Douglass, she would have done well to consult literary scholar John Stauffer's thoughtful study of a foursome of abolitionist friends (including Douglass), <i>The Black Hearts of Men: Radical Abolitionists and the Transformation of Race</i> (2004). The chapter on ""Discourse on Slavery and Democracy"" would have benefited from W. Caleb McDaniel's careful work on Garrison's political thought in <i>The Problem of Democracy in the Age of Slavery: Garrisonian Abolitionists and Transatlantic Reform</i> (2013). These and other recent works on abolitionism could have developed <i>Dismantling Slavery</i>'s discussion of the crucial political tension in the Douglass-Garrison relationship (their eventual disagreement over the relationship between the Constitution and slavery); the secondary literature could also have enhanced the book's treatment of the racial politics of the two men's relationship.</p><p>The University of Tennessee Press ought to have subjected the manuscript to more rigorous editing. The book is rife with typographical errors, and the citations are sometimes spotty. There are also a number of misleading statements regarding historical fact and interpretation. Anadolu-Okur's claim that in the mid-nineteenth century, ""white women were not allowed to attend school or even develop too much interest in secular education"" drastically overstates the restrictions on female education at the time (p. 60). She asserts that only after the circulation of David Walker's <i>Appeal to the Coloured Citizens of the World</i> (1829) did slaveholders ""vex over the possibility of a slave revolution in the making"" --a statement that would have surprised many an anxious eighteenth-century slaveowner. The book dates the Missouri Compromise to 1850 instead of 1820 (p. 123); it places the utopian Northampton Association (of Massachusetts) in New York State (p. 145). Certainly the occasional mistake is bound to escape even the most hawk-eyed editor, but cumulatively these misstatements mar the book's credibility.</p><p>Anadolu-Okur calls Douglass's and Garrison's legacy ""transcendent"" (p. 22). Many who have read the powerful words of these activist-rhetoricians will surely agree. <i>Dismantling Slavery</i> provides an eclectic introduction to these two figures and their world. In order to get a fuller picture of abolitionism in all its complexity, readers would benefit from putting this book alongside other studies of abolitionism. Nonetheless, there is much to appreciate here in Anadolu-Okur's sense of abolitionism's ongoing allure.</p> <p><i>Margot Minardi is Associate Professor of History and Humanities at Reed College and the author of </i>Making Slavery History: Abolitionism and the Politics of Memory in Massachusetts<i>.</i></p>"	Minardi, Margot	Summer 2017	2017-8-1	Review			University of Tennessee Press		Politics;Slavery;Social_History			"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=241 alt=\""Product Cover\"" border=0 src=\""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/dismantlingslaveryWR.jpg\"">"							
6612	9780807165560	$47.95	The Army of the Potomac in the Overland and Petersburg Campaigns: Union Soldiers and Trench Warfare, 1864-1865		Sodergren, Steven E.			"After their Breaking Point: Petersburg and the Refuge of Trenchwarfare<p>Beginning in the late nineteenth century, and continuing into the Centennial period, the eastern campaigns in the Civil War's last year suffered from a dearth of serious scholarship. For a long time, authors and historians consigned the Overland and Richmond-Petersburg Campaigns to the province of legend and memory, with a few iconic moments -- Robert E. Lee being led to the rear by his men; the mud and blood of the Mule Shoe; frontal assaults at Cold Harbor; the maelstrom of the Crater; the surrender at Appomattox -- shaping our collective memory of the period from May 1864 to April 1865. The air of inevitability in which this period is often cast, especially moving into the late summer and fall of 1864, has worked against deep contextual analysis of these campaigns.</p>	<p>The two decades from 1997 to the present have seen a significant improvement to this historiographical imbalance.  I can turn to my personal bookshelf now and see dozens of quality books and essay collections on various aspects of the 1864-1865 campaigns, many informed by viewing the battles, armies, and leaders through the analytical frameworks of race, gender, and the physical environment.  It is in this vein that Steven Sodergren, an associate professor of history at Norwich University, offers his social history of the Army of the Potomac in the Overland and Petersburg campaigns.  In its primary source base, structure, and argument, Sodergren's book resembles J. Tracy Power's <i>Lee's Miserables</i> (1998), which analyzes the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia during the same period.</p>	<p>Sodergren argues that the uninterrupted nature of the fighting during the Overland Campaign drove Union soldiers to the physical and psychological breaking point by the time they crossed the James River in June 1864, and confronted General Robert E. Lee's Confederate forces around Petersburg.  The shift to a more static mode of warfare over that summer, based on the extensive field fortifications employed by both sides, gave Union soldiers a physical refuge of sorts, and allowed them to adjust to their physical conditions.  This process of adaptation regenerated the morale and combat effectiveness of the Union Army, creating the conditions for the successful campaign of March-April, 1865.</p>	<p>Two historiographical schools guide our understanding of Civil War combat motivation and unit effectiveness.  The first, which may be labeled the ""Patriotism School,"" looks to James M. McPherson's <i>For Cause and Comrades</i> (1997) in tracing soldier motivation to the causes for which they fought.  The second, or ""Coping School,"" looks to Gerald M. Linderman's <i>Embattled Courage</i> (1987) to find soldier service in more basic conditions of personal courage (or cowardice) in the face of the fear, chaos, and destruction of combat.  A number of more recent studies add to the debate by introducing deep contextual factors that affect individual motivation.  Mark Grimsley's <i>And Keep Moving On</i> (2002) places the Overland Campaign in a political, strategic, and social context.  Earl Hess's work on field fortifications throughout the war help us to understand their impact on the soldier experience.  His book on field fortifications in and around Petersburg, and his micro-tactical study of the Battle of the Crater, are on the short list of essential books about the last year of the war in the East.  Other recent studies add nuance to the Patriotism School by examining soldier and Army political activity in 1864-65.  Michael Barton's <i>Goodmen: The Character of Civil War Soldiers</i> (1981) is also important in establishing the inner world of these soldiers. Kathryn Shively Meier's excellent essay, ""I Told Him to Go On: Enduring Cold Harbor,"" part of Gary W. Gallagher and Caroline E. Janney's 2015 collected essays on the end of the Overland Campaign, is a recent addition to the Coping School.</p>	<p>Sodergren's book clearly hews to the Coping School in its argument. Nine chapters take the reader from the Overland Campaign, with its grinding operational and tactical tempo, into the environs of Petersburg, where the armies establish themselves for a ten-month campaign that is unprecedented in American history for its scale and diversity.  The losses Major General George Meade's Army of the Potomac incurred from May through June 1864 causes a decline in troop morale and unit effectiveness that stretched the army to the breaking point by mid-June.  Both armies reacted to this destruction and loss of life by entrenching.  The rest of the campaign would be conducted with these fortifications as a base of operations.  Sodergren uses soldier letters and diaries, as well as unit action reports, to trace the army's process of adaptation to its environment.  The physical reprieve offered by fortifications, combined with the massive Federal logistics effort and the presence of northern charitable organizations and an influx of mail from the home front, allowed the Army of the Potomac to regenerate its combat effectiveness.  By March 1865, this process was complete, and the army was ready, as the countryside dried following winter rains, for the campaign that led to the surrender of General Robert E. Lee and his Confederate army at Appomattox Court House.</p>	<p>My critiques of this book center around the author's framing of this campaign as a siege.  In our guide to the campaign published in 2014, Professor Ethan Rafuse and I argue that the Richmond-Petersburg Campaign is more properly understood as a land campaign conducted across a vast landscape, comprising battles of maneuver and raids, with episodic siege operations.  Professor Sodergren focuses his analysis of the campaign on the periods when the soldiers of the Army of the Potomac occupy their trenches; in reality, they conducted maneuver and battle during the entire ten-month campaign, even during the fall and winter months when field operations tended to stop.  This focus may cause the book to miss some important dynamics at work in the Union Army's equation of combat effectiveness.  The battles of July through September 1864 involved large numbers of conscript soldiers and recent immigrants, and the army's high command and unit leaders struggled to assimilate these soldiers into the ranks of veteran units in the midst of aggressive maneuvers around Petersburg and Richmond.  The author's linkage to the trench fighting of World War I is also, in my mind, problematic.  Civil War historians make these connections at their peril, as scholarship on the Great War has taken a much more nuanced turn in the last decade.</p>	<p>These very minor criticisms aside, <i>The Army of the Potomac in the Overland and Petersburg Campaigns</i> is a comprehensively researched, persuasively argued, and engagingly written study that advances significantly our understanding of this pivotal period in the Civil War.  It will take its place among the small number of standard works on this campaign, and it offers a number of fruitful avenues for further study.</p><p><i>Colonel (Retired) Charles R.

6467	9780806151533	$29.95	Kill Jeff Davis: The Union Raid on Richmond, 1864		Venter, Bruce M.			"Ambition's End: The Union Raid on Richmond, 1864<p>In late February of 1864, not quite four thousand Union cavalrymen, commanded by the memorably whiskered Brigadier General Hugh Judson Kilpatrick, bolted south from Stevensburg, Virginia, on a singular sortie aimed at the Confederate capital. ""Beyond an ostensible aim of freeing some thirteen thousand Union men held at Libby Prison and on Belle Isle,"" author and independent historian Bruce M. Venter writes, ""the raiders had a much more sinister objective -- the assassination of the Confederacy's chief executive and members of his cabinet"" (xiv-xv). With this book, a recent addition to the University of Oklahoma Press's ""Campaigns & Commanders"" series, Venter offers a comprehensive narrative of the Kilpatrick-Dahlgren Raid, making thorough use of some recondite archival sources.</p>    <p>Venter situates his account of the Kilpatrick-Dahlgren raid in its larger military context. After an opening chapter that introduces readers to Kilpatrick (""not the solipsist that some modern-day critics like to portray""), the author briefly reviews the significance of Civil War cavalry ""raiding,"" which became ""one of the primary functions"" of mounted Union and Confederate soldiers (11, 13). Venter then chronicles the luckless, early February 1864 effort (conducted by Brigadier General Isaac Wistar from Benjamin Butler's Army of the James) to raid Richmond and empty its ill-famed military prisons.  The failure of this endeavor proved something of a boon for Kilpatrick, who, ""searching for an enterprise that promised maximum national attention,"" scarcely had to persuade President Lincoln of the wisdom of a ""raid similar to Butler's but promising better results"" (57-60).  Nonetheless, the plan met with the considered skepticism of both Alfred Pleasonton and George Meade's staff officer, Lieutenant Colonel Theodore Lyman (90-91).</p>    <p>The book tracks the progress of the main raiding columns -- Kilpatrick's column, which trotted through Spotsylvania and Beaver Dam Station before attacking Richmond, and Colonel Ulric Dahlgren's column, which dashed into Goochland County before bending back to King and Queen County, located north and east of Richmond. Venter likewise considers George Armstrong Custer's efforts to ""draw the attention"" of Lee's army ""toward Charlottesville"" (112).</p>   <p>Ultimately, the raid failed -- a result that Venter attributes to ""bad weather, command and control issues, ignorance of terrain, logistical mishaps, and nearly a total lack of secrecy"" (259). Equally important, the author rejects the conventional wisdom that ""a ragtag bunch of old men, schoolboys, invalids, and government clerks"" was all that stood between the federals and Richmond (260-261). In addition, Venter contends that the entire effort ""was too ambitious,"" succumbing to myriad contingencies and a subordinate (Dahlgren) whose ""command experience was scant"" (263, xvi).</p>   <p>Indeed, Dahlgren's death in King and Queen County would ignite both a contemporary ""firestorm"" and enduring historical intrigue (242). ""Stationery sheets"" discovered on Dahlgren's lifeless body made clear the young colonel's conviction: ""Jeff Davis and Cabinet must be killed on the spot"" (242).  In the book's final chapter, Venter offers a succinct review of the scholarly debates about both the authorship and validity of the Dahlgren Papers.</p>    <p>The author is a prose stylist, and he delivers a narrative teeming with vivid descriptions and extended biographical vignettes. No character is introduced without a colorful train of adjectives. Troopers variously embark on a ""soggy jaunt,"" deliver a ""plunging crossfire,"" and ""gnash some hardtack"" before ""a bleary-eyed but fast-gaited ride"" (5, 41, 115). Take, for example, the opening sentence of Chapter One: as cavalrymen advanced down ""a sloppy road,"" the ""horses' hooves splash[ed] mud on every animal's belly and each rider's stirrups, boots, and uniform trousers"" (3).  Or take this description from the beginning of the raid: ""By the time the 1st Vermont, bringing up the rear guard, finally left Stevensburg about 7:00 P.M., the sky was black but for a dim rim of light at the western horizon"" (99).  Imagination is ineluctably at work in any historical narrative, but it may work overtime here.</p>    <p>In any work of this scope, there will be a minor error or two.  The author, for example, incorrectly identifies the artillerist Dunbar Ransom as ""Duncan"" Ransom (97).  But that should hardly detract from the many accomplishments of this impressively researched account. Based on diligent work in manuscripts, newspapers, and local and national archives, Venter expertly navigates ""the raid's dense forest of subterfuge and surmise"" (271). Any student of the war's military history -- or its cavalry operations in particular -- will want to add this volume to their library.</p>   <p><i>Brian Matthew Jordan is assistant professor of history at Sam Houston State University.

6395	9780674737259	$29.95	This Vast Southern Empire: Slaveholders at the Helm of American Foreign Policy		Karp, Matthew			"An Empire Uncovered	<p><i>This Vast Southern Empire</i> is a notable book about an important, albeit largely unexplored topic.  Professor Matthew Karp investigates both the political role and the strategic outlook of southern cabinet officers and congressional leaders on American foreign and military policy between 1840 and the Civil War.  He wants to understand not only the influence of southerners in those two areas but also the relationship between their stance in that sphere with theirs in purely domestic matters.  Professor Karp bases his book on wide-ranging research in an impressive variety of primary materials.  Joining that base with an exceptional command of secondary sources gives his book distinct authority.</p>	<p>Not surprisingly, he discovers slavery, its protection and defense, as the chief motive for the southerners.  He makes clear that he is dealing with men he defines as ""the southern elite,"" those who represented the slave states in the highest levels of both the executive and legislative branches of the federal government. His key actors includes familiar names like Jefferson Davis, United States senator from Mississippi and secretary of war for Franklin Pierce and those much less well known like James Dobbin, United States congressman from North Carolina and secretary of the navy also in Pierce's cabinet.  I certainly have no quarrel with that focus, for those are precisely the people who influenced and actually made decisions governing American foreign and military policy from the administrations of John Tyler through James Buchanan.  Karp argues persuasively that during those decades American policy in those two critical areas equaled southern policy.  While that conclusion will surprise few historians, his discussion of motive and intent offers vigorously fresh insights.</p>	<p>In Karp's view, these southern leaders were sophisticated internationalists, who saw their particular interest, slavery, in an international context.  For them the security of slavery in the states had two dimensions.  First, the United States must have a military that could protect our shores against any potential foreign enemy.  And they especially wanted a strong navy so that if possible any armed clash if one occurred would take place at sea, not in the midst of their slave society.  Second, they believed the safety of slavery was bound to the health of other places in the hemisphere where unfree labor dominated, chiefly Brazil and Cuba.  Always they riveted attention on Great Britain, the greatest naval power.  On the defensive in the 1840s, they feared a Great Britain that had emancipated slaves in her West Indian colonies might mount or assist some kind of abolition crusade against their own slavery.  Later, in the 1850s, more confident they wanted to insure that no one interfered with Brazil or particularly Cuba, the colony of a weak Spain.</p>	<p>These men strove for both quantitative and qualitative advance in the American army and navy.  They pressed for more men and more ships.  While not getting all they wished, they did manage to increase substantially the size of both branches.  In addition, they obtained much up-to-date technology, from steam-powered ships for the navy to significant upgrades of large and small arms for the army.  By 1860 both sea and land forces had taken giants strides toward modernization.</p>	<p>Conscious that they were constructing a central government with considerable power, these men, according to Karp, did not permit any states-rights theories to hold them back.  As Karp convincingly depicts them, they saw themselves making policy for a great power, one whose strength was only increasing, and would do so for the foreseeable future. The future occupies a central place in Karp's narrative.  His confident southern elite believed that their slave-based agricultural economy with cotton as its bellwether stood in the forefront of economic development and prosperity not only in their country but in the Atlantic and European world, a confidence they would take with them when they established the Confederate States.  Karp envisions these southerners and the socioeconomic environment they both defended and contemplated as preface to the European and even American empires of the late nineteenth century based on compulsory non-white labor.</p> 	<p>Karp sides with current scholars who see the southern economy of the 1850s as prosperous and growing wealthier.  He goes further, however, for he insists that based on what  they could observe around them southerners had every reason for confidence.  The Brazilian and Cuban economies, both slave based, were booming.  Even Great Britain was turning to various forms of unfree or partially free labor in her colonies.</p>  	<p>Of course, as Karp recognizes, the future turned out quite differently.  Free labor and industrialization, not slave labor and agricultural commodities, captured that future.  Still, that fact, he maintains, does not gainsay the southerners' outlook in their time.</p>	<p>Professor Karp also, correctly in my opinion, presents these southern architects of American policy as basically conservative men, who rejected adventurism, or what contemporaries termed filibustering.  They spurned the filibusters who engaged in extra-legal, foolhardy attempts to expand American control, with slavery, to places like Cuba and Nicaragua.  In contrast, they desired the military they had built to back diplomacy aimed at guaranteeing their slave institution in their own country.  And they never separated the two.  They would consider military confrontation only when they perceived their vital interests at stake.</p>	<p>Karp's analysis adds another element to the politics of secession.  Aware of the force now available in the federal government, these southerners saw their entire edifice endangered with the advent of the Republican party.  With anti-South, antislavery Republicans controlling the executive branch, the southerners feared they could no longer count on the power of the United States to guard their interests at home or anywhere else.  Karp does not claim that the potential danger in this aspect of Republican ascendency caused secession, but he leaves little doubt that his elite southerners were concerned about losing their preeminence.  Thus, he justifiably argues that it must be considered in explaining why men like Davis and his colleagues in the southern leadership quickly turned to secession when serious compromise with Republicans proved impossible.</p>	<p>Of course, all ended in an immense irony for the southerners.  The military buildup they had so diligently worked for helped make the United States such a formidable foe when Abraham Lincoln employed it against them.</p>	<p>I trust this review makes clear that Professor Karp merits accolades for <i>This Vast Southern Empire</i>.</p>	<p><i>William J.

He acknowledges later on page 61 that U.S. diplomats in the Americas also had intimate ties to slave traders.    (Perhaps a future scholar can examine more closely the political economy of this flesh peddling:  e.g. what towns, insurance companies, banks, individuals in the U.S. were buoyed as a direct result of the misery inflicted upon Africans -- and what form of reparation is due as a direct result?  For example, it is well-known that Baltimore was the site for construction of numerous ships deployed to transport manacled Africans.)</p>  <p>The author says that about five million enslaved Africans were disembarked in the Americas between 1776 and 1867 with about a 100,000 of this number arriving in the U.S.; this occurred, he says, mostly before 1808, when this malodorous business from Africa was abolished -- officially.  Of course, smuggling of enslaved Africans from independent Texas to the U.S., from Cuba to Key West and from other sites, has to be taken into account when seeking to estimate how many bonded laborers entered the U.S. after 1808. </p>    <p>The author observes on page 248 that prior to the execution of a U.S. slave trader in 1862 under pressure of civil war, in the previous two decades ""at least eight individuals had been granted presidential pardons for their involvement in the slave trade."" </p>       <p>The U.S., he says, was also the major consumer of the produced by these enslaved laborers, who arrived mostly in Brazil.</p>   <p>During a good deal of this period, London was the cop on the beat and the U.S. was the scofflaw, which is not exactly the situation one would expect from the former, which presided over a sprawling empire and the latter, which purportedly had executed a trailblazing ""revolution.""  The author seems to adopt the viewpoint of the U.S. at that moment when he writes on page 158 of the ""failure of emancipation"" in the British Caribbean though the reader is frustrated by a lack of explication of this controversial assertion. </p>    <p>Of course, even the Monroe Doctrine was invoked -- in addition to misleading rhetoric -- to obstruct London's efforts to block U.S. slave trading, with foreign nationals involved in this commerce considering U.S. nationality in order to gain protection from the ""interference"" of Great Britain.</p>    <p>On page 183 the author further seems to accept antebellum U.S. arguments when he apparently sympathizes with the purported dilemma of ""how to enforce anti-slave trade legislation in a free market environment.""  After all, enslaving Africans was not against the law and it did propel capitalism.</p>    <p>Subsequently, despite the eager efforts of those at the time who pointed the finger of accusation at U.S. slave traders as the foremost miscreants during this era -- and despite what was cited above -- the author writes on page 188 that ""Spanish,  Cuban and Portuguese"" nationals were the primary culprits in this grimy business.  Of course, the author acknowledges subsequently that some of these alleged foreign nationals were actually residing in New York City and, most likely, had U.S. citizenship.</p>    <p>The book is well-researched and contributes to the literature on the slave trade and the U.S. role in it.  Primary sources are in Portuguese, Spanish and English, though I would direct future scholars to the Huntington Library in San Marino, California and the Portuguese Foreign Ministry in Lisbon for subsequent studies.</p>  <p><i>Gerald Horne is the John and Rebecca Moores Professor of History at the University of History.

6462	9780807164204	$42.50	Schooling in the Antebellum South: The Rise of Public and Private Education in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama		Hyde, Sarah L.			"Antebellum Education Revised<p>In nineteenth-century southern education, the lines distinguishing public and private were thin, and wisely Sarah L. Hyde casts a wide net in her new study, <i>Schooling in the Antebellum South</i>. Hyde writes against the common misconception that portrays ""inhabitants of that region as shiftless bumpkins content with illiteracy and ignorance."" (1) She admits that her narrative is not one of steady progress -- rather, one of ""setbacks and mistakes [that] seriously marred the system"" (6) --  and she does not present a ""straight trajectory of progress."" (168) But she clearly argues that southern schooling participated in the national mainstream, in step with national trends. By 1860, Hyde maintains, the outlines of a modern public educational system were coming into focus in the South. </p> <p><i>Schooling the American South</i> is a compact, very readable volume that mines the primary sources, covering a large historical literature. Hyde carefully combines institutional with experiential history and in the process nicely weaves individuals' stories into her narrative.  She divides her book into chapters that cover home and private education, mostly during the early nineteenth century and before; the subsequent origins of ""free"" schools, or charity schools begun for those unable to afford private education; the growth of urban schools, especially in New Orleans, Natchez, and Mobile; the establishment of a rubric of statewide common school system; and the experiences of students and teachers inside the classroom. By the time the Civil War began, as she shows, more than a quarter million white Southerners were enrolled in these Gulf South schools. </p><p>Although Hyde asserts that the literature is scant, <i>Schooling in the Antebellum South</i> joins an abundant scholarship over the past three or four decades that reexamines the role of education in the South.  The notion that there was little public schooling in the region dates to early twentieth-century studies of southern education, but nowadays few scholars would dispute this.  Rather, current scholars are considering key issues such as how this system was established and shaped, who it served and to what extent it established itself, and what continuities exist between antebellum and postbellum education.  On these points, Hyde is less informative.  Her strongest and most original material appears in her chapter on urban schools, and here she's on to something. Other studies have shown conclusively that the urban South led the way in mass education.  Publicly supported schools in southern cities became a marker of an emerging urban ethos not only evident in Gulf Coast cities, but also in places like Richmond, Charleston, and Savannah.  This appears to be less true in rural areas, where schooling of any kind was erratic, infrequent, and lacked substantial public support. The story of rural schooling has always differed from that of city schools, but the differences were especially pronounced during the antebellum era. </p><p><i>Schooling in the Antebellum South</i> covers three states, but this reader wants to know the rationale for their selection and how they fit into a larger regional and national pattern. The states of the Old Southwest which Hyde studies possessed characteristics in school structure and funding generally absent in the Old Southeast states of Virginia and the Carolinas, as well as Border South states like Kentucky, Missouri, Tennessee and Maryland. Rather than general comparisons with Massachusetts, more revealing might have been comparisons with the diverse school experiences across the region. </p><p>Perhaps the most serious omission in the book is her treatment of black education. Early in the book, she acknowledges its absence.  On the one hand, in a society in which slave literacy was criminalized, how possible was it to establish a mass educational system? She suggested slaveholders' unease in other parts of the book about the implications of mass education, but could more have been explored about how a slave society questioned learning among the white and black underclass. On the other hand, some scholars have shown that schooling for slaves did exist informally -- indeed, that an underground system in some instances provided for learning and literacy.  The slaveholders' prohibition on slave education, if anything, fanned enthusiasm for literacy as a marker of freedom -- something immediately evident during Civil War and Reconstruction, when freed slaves rushed into schools in search of literacy.</p><p><i>Schooling in the Antebellum South</i> is nonetheless a welcome addition to the literature on southern education. Well written and organized, it is indispensable to students of the origins of mass schooling in the South.</p><p><i>William A. Link</i></p><p><i>University of Florida</i></p>"	Link, William A.

6558	807165212	$38.00	The Secret Life of Bacon Tait a White Slave Trader Married to a Free Woman of Color		Trent, Hank			"Bacon Tait's Secret Life Revealed<p>Archival sources are at the core of almost everything historians do. Private correspondence, business records, autobiographical musings, family oral tradition -- we count on these sorts of materials as we attempt to reconstruct the past. So what do we do when someone who fascinates us has left almost none of the above?  Such is the case with the subject of this biography, Bacon C. Tait, a major Richmond, Virginia, slave trader whose life is certainly worth studying. Hank Trent has come close to pulling off a scholarly miracle in reconstructing Tait's life and his long-term relationship with Courtney Fountain, a free woman of color. Although there are many questions left unanswered in Trent's account, the surprising thing is how much we can learn about this man and the dismal business in which he was engaged.</p> <p> ""The largest known set of Tait's personal papers -- a couple dozen letters -- is mixed in with the correspondence that Rice C. Ballard saved from his slave-trading colleagues,"" the author tells us (p. 94).  So that's it -- ""a couple dozen letters."" Most historians would give up at this point, but Hank Trent forged ahead.  Birth, death, and marriage records, tax rolls, manuscript state and federal census returns, and as many other public sources as he can get his hands on was his starting point. He combed through decades of newspapers seeking information on Tait and his business and family affairs, principally in the two cities where he spent most of his adult life, Richmond and Salem, Massachusetts. He also reconstructed as best he could the life of Courtney Fountain and her fascinating, abolitionist family.  The result is a portrait of a ruthless slave trader who gives every indication of being a devoted family man, one who treated the African American woman with whom he shared his life with years of loyalty and support.  His considerable personal fortune he left to their four children when he died in 1871.</p> <p>Here are the basics. Bacon C. Tait was born near Lynchburg in 1796 to a reasonably well-to-do Virginia family. Using funds he inherited from his father in 1814, he, like many young Virginians of his era, found his way to Richmond. Through real estate deals in the growing city and through small-scale slave trading, he gradually built a thriving business in both of these areas, eventually erecting a substantial slave jail in Richmond and expanding his slave trading operations into the Deep South, New Orleans in particular.</p><p>His relationship with Courtney Fountain, a free Negro woman living near him in Richmond, began in the 1840s. Trent speculates that Tait wanted very much to marry a well-bred white woman but could not find a bride willing to have him, maybe because of his profession as a trafficker in human flesh. Perhaps, but one wonders about this when we learn that Tait served for years in the late antebellum era on the Richmond City Council. Possibly he, like a number of other Richmond slave traders (Hector Davis, Robert Lumpkin, and Silas Omohundro come immediately to mind) was attracted to a woman of color for reasons centering around his business activities. The frequency with which this happened is clearly one of the issues we would like to know more about. Tait never formally married Courtney Fountain, but they were, to all intents and purposes, husband and wife for decades.</p><p>In 1852, as their four children -- three girls and a boy -- reached school age, Tait purchased a home in Salem, where members of Courtney's extended family lived. In the pre-war years that followed, Tait divided his time between his family in Salem, where he was known simply as a Richmond businessman, and his thriving slave-trading activities in Virginia.  In the Civil War that followed, Tait's trading business suffered, but his real estate holdings gave him a financial cushion that enabled him to survive the war years with a considerable amount of his wealth intact.  But he and Courtney lived mostly apart as his mental and physical health deteriorated in the late 1860s; he died in Richmond in 1871 (as did she in Salem that same year), and his cause of death was reported as ""old age & softening of the brain"" (p. 163), On his demise, he left his large and very valuable estate to his four children.</p><p>Hank Trent's slender volume is valuable on a number of grounds, but probably none is more important than this: we know very little about the men who ran the critically important slave-trading enterprises in one of the antebellum South's premier slave-trading cities. Whether because of the fire that swept Richmond at the time of Federal occupation in 1865 or because of willful destruction of correspondence and business records traders did not want to fall into unfriendly hands or simply because of an accident of fate, the surviving records of slave dealers in this supremely important Upper South trading center are exceedingly thin.  <i>The Secret Life of Bacon Tait</i> opens a rare window into that dank and depressing world, and we are indebted to the author for the light he has shed on this dark corner of southern history.</p>    <p><i>Charles B.

6335	9780881465402	$35.00	Between Fetters and Freedom: African American Baptists since Emancipation		Crowther, Edward	Harper, Keith		"Baptists Remade: A New Look African American Baptists Since Emancipation<p>Much of what we know about African Americans in the nineteenth century comes from studies of their religious lives. Of the African Americans who were Christians, most preferred Baptist and Methodist churches for various reasons, including their ""outsider"" status in society, their evangelical worship practices, and their opposition to slavery, even though it was sporadic and short-lived. Over time and especially after the Civil War, African Americans shaped a unique Baptist identity that combined European and African elements. They developed state conventions, engaged in missionary work, established Sunday Schools, and supported African American educational institutions.  All of this work coincided with the development of national conventions, culminating with the National Baptist Convention, USA in 1895. From that time forward, churches became centers of African American community, activism, and witness, particularly in the Civil Rights Movement. All of this information is well known.  But this is only part of the story, as questions remain about the full implications of African American Baptist history. Was Christianity, or in this case the Baptist faith, primarily a force of liberation for African Americans? Or was E. Franklin Frazier correct in arguing that the black church mostly served white interests and was ""responsible for the so-called backwardness of"" African Americans? (3) There are also questions of theology, hymnody, and liturgy.  How diverse were African American Baptist churches in their worship practices, especially compared to churches controlled by whites? </p>  <p>This book examines these and other questions, focusing on what it has meant to be both African American and Baptist since emancipation. As an edited collection of essays, this book is not a comprehensive analysis of African American Baptist history. But these chapters challenge us to rethink our current understanding of Baptist history in the United States. Charles F. Irons, for example, questions the standard interpretation that the church offered African Americans an opportunity for freedom that all accepted wholeheartedly. In fact, as Irons writes, many African Americans in North Carolina refused to join black churches and continued worshipping in churches controlled by whites. The reasons were many, often hinging on the difficulties a newly freed people had in adopting to the realities of Reconstruction. </p>  <p>Even when these chapters do not challenge the prevailing historiography, they offer new insights from diverse perspectives. Sandy Martin persuasively analyzes the power that theological conditions wielded for African American Baptists in the Reconstruction era and beyond. As he asserted, ""far from experiencing the Civil War and even the collapse of Reconstruction as an occasion for a religion of Lost Cause, African American Baptists instead held on to the convictions that God was still acting in history to liberate them spiritually and temporally"" (27).  In another intriguing chapter, Eric Michael Washington examined the theological concept of ""Ethiopianism,"" the ""belief that God had decreed the redemption of Africa and included in that decree was the enslavement, emancipation, and emigration of persons of African descent in the United States"" (86). This theological concept motivated African American Baptists to shape their own missionary movements and contributed to nationalist views in the National Baptist Convention, USA. We can hardly overemphasize this emphasis on mission in Baptist life. More often than not, Baptists shaped their institutions around missionary efforts and have heralded missionaries as heroic models. For Southern Baptists, Lottie Moon and Annie Armstrong became household names as the Convention associated them with Christmas and Easter offerings for missions. Often overlooked, however, is the question of how Baptist missionaries cooperated (or failed to) across racial divisions. April C. Armstrong's essay contributes admirably to this question, focusing on the interactions between Annie Armstrong and Nannie Helen Burroughs, who founded the Women's Convention in the NBC. </p>  <p>As Wayne Flynt helpfully observed in the afterword, this book is a ""refreshing lens adjustment"" in that it changes ""our vision of an entire denominational landscape"" by ""focusing on lots of different details"" (254). He is correct. This book challenges preconceived notions of African American Baptist history, and it does so in an insightful way. These nine chapters are well-written and engaging narratives of personalities, events, and ideas  --  both inside and outside the mainstream  --  and together they offer a richly textured analysis of the subject. This book is a valuable read for anyone who seeks to understand Baptist history in the United States. </p> <p><i>James P.

6579	9780393292633	$35.00	The Thin Light of Freedom: Civil War and Emancipation in the Heart of America		Ayers, Edward L.			"Before and After Appomattox<p>For the past decade and a half, Edward Ayers devoted himself to administrative duties, first as Dean of Arts and Sciences at the University of Virginia and then from 2007 to 2015 as the University of Richmond's president.  While fine for UVA and Richmond, these arrangements left Ayers with little time to write. <i>The Thin Light of Freedom</i> marks his long-awaited return to historical scholarship.</p>  <p>Here Ayers picks up the thread of his new volume's compelling predecessor, <i>In the Presence of Mine Enemies</i>.<sup>1</sup>  Both books focus on two localities --  Augusta County, Virginia, just across the Blue Ridge from Charlottesville, and Franklin County, Pennsylvania, immediately above the Maryland line, one hundred fifty miles northeast from Augusta.  Both were located in the Great Valley, most often called the Shenandoah Valley south of the Potomac and the Cumberland Valley north from there.</p>  <p>In his first volume, Ayers looked at those in the South who were not original secessionists and those in the North who failed to see slavery as a moral problem.  He asked why these people, who had no previous quarrel with each other, suddenly were transformed into implacable enemies.  He found that Southern Unionists might tolerate Abraham Lincoln\'s election, much as they regretted it, but they would not fight to coerce sister slave states.  When told to do so, they resolved with fierce unanimity to fight Lincoln himself.  A new nation, created amid the shock of war, sprang to life.  Northerners viewed the Union as sacred.  They considered secession a minority coup and hoped initially that military force would scatter the conspirators and allow the South's loyal majority to reassert itself.  Only gradually did the North come to understand what it was up against.  Few either North or South saw in advance the catastrophe that impended.</p>  <p>Ayers' preceding volume broke off in late June 1863 when invading Confederates headed east across South Mountain from Chambersburg, Franklin's county seat, to unite their forces at a town called Gettysburg.  The Cumberland Valley had just become the only part of the North to face an enemy occupation.  It would be hit again, and harder.  Augusta County had so far been spared any direct enemy presence.  But its turn would come and it already was greatly affected by the war.  Compared to Franklin and other parts of the North, the Confederate South (including Augusta) sent more of its sons and husbands to fight and they suffered proportionately higher casualties.  Although the slave system tended to unravel in parts of the South controlled by the Union army -- along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, and in the Mississippi Valley -- three million slaves ""still labored beyond the reach of Union power"" and Confederate marauders had just enslaved some free blacks in Pennsylvania (1).</p><p>By mid-1863 a war that never could have been imagined two years earlier had engulfed the land.  The revolutionary war aim of ending slavery had superseded the limited war aim of restoring the old Union, as Lincoln sought both to weaken a key foundation of the Confederate war effort and to enlist African-Americans in the army.  Indignant white Southerners promised to fight to the death.  And many did. </p><p>Two years of bitter fighting already had killed and wounded hundreds of thousands and posed questions that could not be answered.  Would Northerners remain willing to pay a high price to compel the South to return to the Union?  Or would the ferocious intensity of Southern national feeling force the North to acquiesce?  As of late June 1863, the outcome stood in doubt.  But nobody could doubt the war's ""enormous scale"" or the way it affected all Americans, white and black (23).  Armies flooded across landscapes, ""leveling forests and devastating fields, stripping food and livestock, washing away in an hour the work of generations"" (2).</p><p>Ayers tells multiple stories in <i>The Thin Light of Freedom</i>.  Painting with a broad brush, he sketches a vast canvas -- the bloodiest conflict in the Western world between 1815 and 1914.  But the two localities in the Great Valley remain his principal focus.  He balances expertly between oft-separated realms of Civil War-era studies: military histories that give priority to major battles, and recent work that explores the war's impact on the home front and shows how civilian and military affairs interconnected.  Throughout, Ayers incorporates the experiences of slaves and free blacks.  He traces the unexpected dynamic that led to emancipation and, before long, to a constitutional mandate for equal rights.  The entire second half of the book is devoted to Reconstruction, in contrast to the plethora of Civil War writing that ends abruptly in April 1865.</p><p>Featured individuals carry Ayers' narrative.  Their stories are juxtaposed and interwoven with stories about those who lived in the rival nation.  By examining both at once, Ayers reveals far more than if he had focused either on one locale or the other.  Soldiers and civilians, men and women, free and slave, white and black, the prominent and the obscure -- all found themselves caught in an extraordinary, dangerous, and unpredictable maelstrom.</p>   <p>Several of Ayers' principals were well-known in their own time, albeit forgotten today.  Alexander H. H. Stuart, once a member of Millard Fillmore's cabinet, and his politically astute brother-in-law, John B. Baldwin, lived in Staunton, the Augusta County seat.  Among the most prominent of Virginia Whig anti-secessionists, Stuart and Baldwin became loyal Confederates.  After the war they took the lead in devising a formula that allowed Virginia to return to the Union without ever electing a Reconstruction government.  Staunton also was home to Northern-born cartographer Jedediah Hotchkiss, who made maps for Stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee.  The fiery secessionist, John Imboden, raised a regiment of partisan rangers that preyed on larger, more ponderous Union forces; he was entrusted by Lee to protect the Confederate lifeline through the Valley during the Gettysburg campaign's desperate weeks.  Joseph Waddell maintained a brave front in his newspaper, the <i>Staunton Spectator</i>, but his private diary revealed his inner doubts about both slavery and the Confederate cause. </p><p>Waddell's counterpart, Chambersburg newspaper publisher Alexander K. McClure, edited the <i>Repository</i>.  McClure was a rising power in the Pennsylvania Republican Party and a confidant of Lincoln's.  Particularly rich surviving diaries detail the lives and thoughts of two young Chambersburg residents separated by war: Rachel Cormany -- sensitive, principled, and appealingly modern -- waited anxiously at home while her husband, Samuel Cormany, fought in a Pennsylvania cavalry regiment.  Careful sleuthing enables Ayers to recapture the voices of several African-Americans.  Jacob Christy from Franklin County fought with the famed 54th Massachusetts Infantry, as did his brother William Christy, who died in battle.  Also in the 54th was David Demus, who corresponded with his wife Mary Jane, a sister of the Christy brothers.  Nelson Irwin and Willis M. Carter provide glimpses of African-American striving -- and frustration -- in postwar Staunton.</p><p>Three riveting chapters address the terrible summer and fall of 1864 when ""opposing armies in the Valley contended for immense stakes"" and both side practiced ""hard war"" against each other.<sup>2</sup> Jubal Early, retaliating for depredations inflicted by Union forces under David Hunter, ordered 2,800 Confederate raiders to burn Chambersburg on July 30.  That shocking deed prompted Ulysses S. Grant to install thirty-three year old Philip Sheridan as commander of a new Army of the Shenandoah, with orders to defeat Early and ""lay waste"" to the Valley (227).  ""Towering columns of smoke"" in September and October marked the progress of Sheridan's campaign, which incinerated countless barns and mills and a year's worth of just-harvested crops (250).  Many farms in rural Augusta were torched (Staunton itself was only briefly occupied and relatively unscathed).  Ayers addresses the moral quandaries wholesale destruction posed for both sides.  The burnings ""did not break the will of the people"" but they did intensify mutual hatreds and foster resentments that festered for generations (251).  Readers are left to weigh between Grant's hope that Lee's stubborn resistance behind the Petersburg entrenchments might end if he lost the Valley's agricultural bounty and the sad spectacle of a Virginia ""farm woman"" weeping over the body of a lifeless colt, shot by Union soldiers (239).</p><p>Because Lee hung on through the coming winter, Sheridan's destructive blitz failed to accomplish all that Grant hoped for.  But its political effects were unmistakable.  By destroying Early's army and insuring that Washington, D.C., and the Cumberland Valley finally would be secure from Confederate attack, Sheridan's ""swift hoofs, thundering South"" delivered a perfectly-timed boost for Lincoln's re-election campaign (249).</p> <p>Ayers insists that politics mattered.  He notes that political parties, constructed from the ground up both North and South during the prewar era, had connected ""America's patchwork of localities, denominations, and ethnic groups into alliances that could win national elections"" (111).  When these parties fractured along sectional lines, war resulted.  But wartime politics played out differently North and South.  Confederates ""suppressed earlier partisan identities in favor of a unifying new national identity"" and ""mobilized the white people of the South as only a warring government could"" (109, 278).  By contrast, the North was ""saturated by partisan political fighting and rhetoric"" throughout the war (129).  Democrats saw Lincoln as a dictator who trampled the Constitution and offered top military commands to inept blunderers.  When the president enlarged Union war aims to include emancipation, Democrats howled in protest.  Abolition, they warned, would lead to permanent disunion.  They deplored Sheridan's ""hard war"" in the Shenandoah; ""such acts of cold blooded barbarity"" blasted all hope for reunion and promised only endless war (246).  Complaints in Northern Democratic newspapers were ""hungrily reprinted throughout the Confederacy"" and gave substance to Southern hopes that the North might ultimately tire of fighting and accept Confederate independence (127).  By 1864, however, Lincoln had ""abandoned the idea of widespread southern loyalism"" and resolved to fight with more than ""elder-stalk squirts, charged with rose water.""<sup>3</sup>  Spurning Democrats as ""disloyal at best and treasonous at worst,"" Republicans depicted themselves as the only hope for the Union (273).</p><p>Ayers rejects the idea that ""the vigorous two-party system helped the North win the war, creating a democratic crucible in which white Northerners found common purpose through conflict"" (273).  Instead, a ""near-perfect alignment of military and political circumstances"" enabled Lincoln and his party to carry the all-important elections in late 1864 (270).  ""What could have been a tragic weakness turned out to be a critical strength"" as Republicans insisted upon winning the war unconditionally and ending slavery; the outcome legitimated ""the views of the winning coalition"" (273, 279).</p> <p>But there would be no respite from partisan politics.  Republican success in the 1864 elections ""shifted the debate in the North from slavery to race"" (276).  Democrats ""doubled down on race, making black people the defining difference between the parties"" (353).  When the war ended, new partisan allegiances began to coalesce across sectional lines, as Northern Democrats and defeated white Southerners supported Lincoln's successor, Andrew Johnson, and opposed any enlargement of black rights.  The South appeared poised to regain the political leverage it forfeited during wartime.  But Republicans refused to buckle.  Moderates such as McClure, the Chambersburg newspaper publisher, became more openly egalitarian than they ever had been before.  The entire country had an obligation to the freedmen, he wrote, and we should ""amend for the injury we have done them"" (294).  Within months of Lincoln's assassination, ""run-of-the-mill Republicans were making progressive arguments that Lincoln himself could not have stated so boldly"" (353).</p>  <p>It was to be an uphill battle.  The Republican Party that championed equal civil and political rights ""pushed against the weight of all American history.""  Before long, its reserves of   ""electoral fuel"" were spent.  Wily white Virginians, led by Stuart and Baldwin, thwarted the new order.  In retrospect, Ayers finds it more remarkable that Republicans temporarily embraced such a ""comprehensive"" agenda for change than that their handiwork ultimately was undermined (463).  He dismisses the stale idea that wiser leadership could have devised a more unifying Reconstruction policy.  And he sadly notes that McClure, like too many other Republicans, eventually reneged on his party's commitment to equal rights.</p><p>Ayers rejects conventional theories that see the war's outcome as predictable consequences of a more modern Northern economy and the North's large population advantage.  Instead, he insists that ""Republicans, United States soldiers, abolitionists, and enslaved people persevered through often-demoralizing circumstances"" to overcome an unseemly coalition of Confederates and Northern Democrats.  It was a close call, not a sure thing.  Ayers' eye for irony elevates his writing.  ""Without secession, the mobilization of vast armies, and years of military success by the new Confederacy there would have been no full-scale emancipation in the 1860s,"" he observes.  ""Without defiant former Confederates and Northern enemies of African-American rights there would have been no Radical Reconstruction or Fourteenth Amendment.  Americans made each others' history, often in ways they did not foresee or intend"" (xix).</p><p>The Augusta segments of Ayers' story resonate more fully in <i>The Thin Light of Freedom</i> than the Franklin ones, just as in this volume's predecessor.  The vagaries of surviving sources -- richer for Virginia than for Pennsylvania -- may explain this result.  Or it may be that a more striking cast of characters lived in Staunton than in Chambersburg.  But Virginia almost inevitably commands center stage.  This was the white South's war of choice.  Fearing the loss of slavery, secessionists chose to fight and thereby lost slavery.  Race-related matters absorbed plenty of printer's ink in Pennsylvania too, and we are bound to honor the heretofore-obscure black Pennsylvanians who fought in the Massachusetts 54th.  But the central Civil War-era drama played out in the former slave states.</p> <p>Ayers provides a fine-grained assessment of the complex interplay between the slavery issue and the war.  He reminds us that while some white Northerners made common cause with black Southerners, almost as many other white Northerners obstructed the war effort and eagerly reached out to white Southerners as soon as the shooting ended.  Northern Democrats -- here, the hideous editorials in Chambersburg's <i>Valley Spirit</i>  -- validated both the white South's horror of emancipation and its quest to block any extension of citizen rights to African-Americans.  <i>The Thin Light of Freedom</i> stands far apart from gauzy ""all's well that ends well"" salutes to national greatness. </p><p>The cover of this handsomely produced book reproduces a troubling painting by the great Albert Bierstadt, entitled <i>Guerrilla Warfare -- Civil War</i> (1862).

Historians, of course, have long mined the black press for sources relating to African American communities, activism, politics, and culture.  But much recent work has come from literary scholars investigating nineteenth century black newspapers as important vehicles for black writers of poetry, short stories, novels, and children's literature who could find few outlets for their work among mainstream publishers.  This growing body of work has transformed the study of African American literature and has made research on the black press one of the most dynamic areas within African American studies.</p><p>Benjamin Fagan, assistant professor of English at Auburn University, enters this field with <i>The Black Newspaper and the Chosen Nation</i>, in which he argues that antebellum black newspapers promoted varied expressions of black ""chosenness"" as a central conceptual structure in African Americans' quest for freedom and equality.  Though situated in an English department, Fagan's interest in the construct of blacks as a chosen people is less literary than political.  The book's five chapters, framed by an Introduction and Conclusion, proceed chronologically from the 1820s to the 1860s, with each chapter focusing on a prominent black newspaper that articulated a particular variety of the chosen nation with which the editors seemed to identify.</p><p>Fagan begins with <i>Freedom's Journal</i>, the first African American newspaper, published in New York from 1827 to 1829.  This mouthpiece for New York's black elite targeted African Americans' public conduct: black Americans could fulfill their destiny as God's chosen nation only by adhering to the broader society's standards of respectability through appropriate public comportment.  Like other scholars examining black New York, Fagan focuses on the disconnect between elite champions of respectability and those who embraced a more animated culture of the streets, a conflict played out most visibly in debates over how to acknowledge New York State's abolition of slavery on July 4, 1827.</p><p>Chapter 2 examines another New York paper, the <i>Colored American</i>, which in the late 1830s linked black chosenness with the ""a distinctly American nation state"" informed by the ""language and logic of American millennialism"" (46).  The paper fully embraced an exceptionalist American identity and envisioned an American chosen nation in which blacks and whites acting as equal partners represented a necessary step in the fulfillment of Biblical prophecy.  White Americans' fierce resistance to racial equality moved the paper by 1840 to a jeremiadic position that cast the United States as a new Babylon and reserved chosen status to African Americans and Native Americans, both of whom could claim a solidarity of oppression with the ancient Israelites.</p><p>Frederick Douglass's <i>North Star</i> expanded the contours of black chosenness in the late 1840s by linking African Americans' freedom struggle with the European revolutions of 1848 and other oppressed peoples' quests for self-determination and equality.  In casting black Americans as part of a ""global army of liberation"" (74), Douglass rejected the American exceptionalism of the <i>Colored American</i> in favor of a transnational community united in its opposition to all forms of tyranny.  The <i>North Star</i> embraced neither faith in American institutions nor support of revolutionary violence; rather, Douglass and his staff maintained earlier newspapers' calls for temperate public conduct as a tool through which blacks might attract support for their peaceful revolution.</p><p>Both American identity and blackness were rejected as sources of chosenness by Mary Ann Shadd.  During the mid-1850s her Canadian publication, the Provincial Freeman, touted Canada as the freest place on earth for blacks and advocated that blacks embrace an identity as British subjects.  Shadd believed the British people represented the chosen nation with which blacks must identify, even advising against any participation in racially exclusive organizations.</p><p>Fagan's final chapter focuses on New York's <i>Weekly Anglo-African</i>, which was published throughout the Civil War.  The paper provided a forum for African Americans to air their diverse views on the war and the role African Americans might play in it.  The editors presented the war as the tool selected by God to liberate his chosen people, counseling black men to prepare to fight even before the Emancipation Proclamation opened the U.S. army to black enlistees.  Once black men were in the field the editors stressed soldiers' duty toward their enslaved brethren; they were now a literal army of liberation and once more the United States was presented, for the time being, as the champion of God's chosen people.</p><p>Fagan incorporates many important political and intellectual threads of antebellum African American culture into this volume -- respectability, transnationalism, emigration, revolution, and nationalism prominent among them.  The connecting fabric is the concept of blacks as a chosen nation, which itself embodies two themes that are deeply embedded in both American and African American experiences: exceptionalism and evangelical Christianity.  While the newspapers discussed did not have ties to any religious denomination, many of their editors and central contributors were either ministers or fundamentally informed by religious sensibilities.  Fagan is correct in emphasizing that any understanding of black print culture in this period must take stock of how a sense of sacred destiny informed even the most apparently secular positions.</p><p>Most of the issues and individuals discussed in this book will be familiar to specialists in nineteenth century African American history.  Taken separately, many of Fagan's observations have been addressed by previous scholars, sometimes in much more depth.  At times Fagan seems to overstate or oversimplify his points of emphasis to fit them into the framework of the chosen nation.  <i>Freedom's Journal</i> surely played an important role in circulating ideas and solidifying a northern free black activist culture, but it was one of many vehicles for pontificating about black behavior, before, during, and after its brief run.  It hardly played the causal role in shaping northern black leaders' obsession with respectable public conduct that Fagan implies.</p><p>Similarly, in describing the disagreement between Frederick Douglass and Mary Ann Shadd over whether a black or a British identity held more promise for black liberation, Fagan oversimplifies Douglass's position.  In the specific editorial exchanges discussed in the book, Douglass indeed minimized Britain's importance and ""argued that race, more than anything else, defined and united black people worldwide"" (116).  But this was a situational argument explicitly crafted to discourage black emigration to Canada.  Douglass's August First orations in this same period, on the other hand, praise Britain as the best hope for freedom in the world.  And Douglass's solidarity with Italian, Hungarian, and Irish nationalists, among other global movements among non-blacks, suggests that he saw African Americans as of a kind with those other combatants in the struggle between liberty and slavery.</p><p>In contrast to these reservations, I find Fagan's analysis of the <i>Colored American</i> in the late 1830s compelling.  The construct of the chosen nation in the context of the nation's surge of millennial perfectionism in this case works very well to make sense of the editors' shifting positions on black identity and African Americans' status within the American nation.  A question I am still grappling with is whether or not situating all these newspapers and their positions within the construct of the chosen nation advances our understanding of the intellectual and political workings of the era's African American activists and communities.  At the very least, <i>The Black Newspaper and the Chosen Nation</i> provides a new angle of vision on familiar issues and questions.  Individual scholars will come to different conclusions about the approach's value, but the fresh perspective offered in this slim volume must be taken into account.</p><p><i>Mitch Kachun is Professor of History at Western Michigan University; author of </i>Festivals of Freedom: Memory and Meaning in African American Emancipation Celebrations, 1808-1915<i> (Massachusetts 2003 [paper 2006]); and co-editor of </i>The Curse of Caste; or, the Slave Bride <i>(Oxford 2006), an 1865 serialized novel by Julia C.

6397	9780813062723	$79.95	Show Thyself A Man: Georgia State Troops, Colored, 1865-1905		Mixon, Gregory			"Between Service and Citizenship<p>The idea of the citizen soldier, particularly members of local militia units, has always been at the center of the ideal of American citizenship. Military service allowed men to claim citizenship based on their efforts to defend their community. Ironically, the people who most needed to receive the benefits of military service, African Americans, have not always been allowed to serve because white Americans feared that this service would translate into an upgraded political and social status. Despite these barriers, black Americans served: in the Revolution, the War of 1812, the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, and all the wars of the twentieth and twenty-first century.  In the post Civil War regular Army, African American units provided a significant percentage of ground combat power, including two infantry regiments (24th and 25th) and two cavalry regiments (9th and 10th). Despite their service in wartime and peacetime, African Americans did not receive the same recognition as citizens until well into  the twentieth century. Gregory Mixon, an associate professor of history at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte and the author of <i>The Atlanta Riot: Race, Class, and Violence in a New South City</i> examines a lesser-known aspect of post-Civil War black military service--African Americans' service in state militias--in <i>Show Thyself a Man: Georgia State Troops, Colored, 1865-1905</i>. Mixon chronicles the service of mostly formerly-enslaved men in Georgia militia units from the end of the Civil War until a decade before World War I. </p>  <p>In the immediate aftermath of Union victory and emancipation, during the United States' military occupation, black and white Georgians created independent militia companies. According to Mixon, ""both races mobilized their respective populations for political action during these years, with the militia company serving as the centerpiece in that effort"" (24). When black Georgians did so, Mixon argues, they were inspired by black independent militia companies in the antebellum north that had been a ""medium by which free blacks established their claim as citizens of the nation and northern states"" (25). After the war ended in Southern states, Mixon explains, these units provided self-defense for freed people and asserted ""African American political, citizenship, and property ownership rights. Post-Civil War blacks therefore used the militia company as a way of declaring that they belonged and were members of the national polity"" (25). In addition to examining the Georgia militia, Mixon also assessed other black militia units in the western hemisphere, such as Afro-Cuban organizations. He finds some important parallels in why these men served in military units, including the idea that militia service allowed these men to ""find freedom, citizenship and belonging"" (11) in their local communities. </p> <p>Surprisingly, despite the politicized nature of these units, they survived ""Redemption"" and the reinstallation of white rule at Reconstruction's end. No longer independent, these black units reorganized as part of the regular state militia and later the Georgia State Troops, Colored. In my view, this is the most intriguing part of Mixon's story. It is true that these black units were segregated and not treated as well as white units, but it is astonishing that they were allowed to continue to operate until 1905. According to Mixon, it was the federal government that forced Georgia to retain black militia units and that may partly explain their survival. The focus of Mixon's study is not white decision-makers who allowed black men to serve but on African American soldiers and why they created, maintained, and sustained these units in the face of white opposition. As such, he makes a detailed examination of specific units, for example, the Savannah Hussars--the only black cavalry unit in the state troops. Despite discrimination and systematic under-resourcing, the men of the Hussars and other black militiamen belonged to these units because they ""defined national belonging as a critical part of their freedom"" (188). Eventually, black soldiers' dedication to their units could not save them. Ironically, it was the federal government's post Spanish-American military reforms that allowed Georgia to disband all of its black state troops and create the all-white Georgia National Guard. </p> <p>Mixon's research into this critical aspect of postbellum life is impeccable and represents a significant contribution to the study of African American military history. The value of this study is only somewhat diminished by certain organizational issues related to the book's structure. First, the introduction's format serves the rest of the book poorly.  It spends a great deal of time on militias outside the United States and does not do what readers expect it to do, introduce the book.  The first part of chapter one, which explains the author\'s purpose and thesis, should be in the introduction.  The next section in chapter one returns to a transnational discussion of militias; the main topic of the book, Georgia's black militia, do not reappear until later. Given the value of this subject, this is unfortunate.  In addition, the information on militias outside the United States is not well integrated into the rest of the book.  His discussion suggests that a transitional approach to black militia service would be worthwhile but that this approach is difficult within the context of an examination of one state militia organization. </p> <p>Despite these issues, this is a tremendously valuable study. One issue it does raise: do we emphasize the relationship between citizenship and military service too much?  Based on how white Americans treated black soldiers in the past, this connection may have been merely theoretical, fodder for recruiting officers. Observing the success of recent political aspirants who have never served in the military, prompted my reassessment of this idea. Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand African American military service and the ambiguous relationship between military service and American citizenship. </p> <p><i>Barbara A.

6338	9780807162125	$48.00	Confederate Political Economy: Creating and Managing a Southern Corporatist Nation		Bonner, Michael			"Beyond a Backwater: Confederate Corporatists in the Civil War	<p>A great deal of work has been done attempting to explain the relationship between the Confederate government and the business leaders of the fledgling nation.  Building on this work, Michael Bonner, in his new book <i>Confederate Political Economy: Creating and Managing a Southern Corporatist Nation</i>, explores how the Confederacy was really a corporatist nation, a form of economy traditionally associated with a much later point in history where industrial leaders, the government, and labor unions work together.  While, as labor did not play a major role in Confederate political economy, ""Confederate modernization involved a complicated process of give-and-take between bureaucrats and industrial managers, with each group liable and responsible to the other for mutual success.""(3)  Bonner deftly reaches into the history of the Confederacy and shows how government and business leaders interrelated with each other in such a way so that manufacturers were able to direct government policy to the benefit of business while still serving the needs of an ever-centralizing government.  To make his points, Bonner explores three main topics: the working of specific parts of the Confederate government, industries owned by the government, and industries owned privately that worked with the government. </p>  <p>Bonner begins his book with a review of how this new Confederate government functioned, focusing on the use of secret sessions by the Confederate Congress and the trials and tribulations the Supreme Court faced in trying to form, a goal that the southern leadership never achieved.  Secret sessions seemed to be against the freedom that the Confederate people left the Union to preserve.  But, the problems of fighting a war were difficult to deal with, and secrecy seemed to be the best way to marshal the resources of the nation to fight and establish that freedom.  Thus, southern leaders established that they were willing to go to whatever lengths they must to secure independence, no matter how distasteful, including the centralization of power in a strong executive, needed for the creation of corporatist state.  Moreover, by using secrecy, the Confederate government created, ""a sense of unified purpose between the legislative and executive branches.""(41)  This would be important as the government later attempted to work with business leaders to keep the war effort moving forward.  Finally, not establishing the Supreme Court authorized by the Confederate Constitution allowed for greater consolidation of power by the executive branch. </p>  <p>At first, Confederate officials turned to private munition industries to support the war effort and keep armies in the field.  Government officials entered into contracts with these firms to buy their production, contracts that were constantly re-negotiated to the benefit of the business owners.  Bonner's major examples were the Tredegar Iron Works and the Shelby Iron Company.  In those instances, the owners of the firms supported the Confederate government and the war effort, but, they entered into contracts with the government based on their own needs.  These contracts were often seen later in the war as profiteering, but, in the end, they were just business direction of governmental policies, as the business owners were seen as the ones who understood their industries the best.  Moreover, business leaders created strong allies in the government creating a strong working relationship in this centralizing state. </p>   	<p>Private industries could not support the needs of the entire war effort, thus state owned munition industries were founded to help fill the gap.  Bonner tells the story of George Washington Rains and the success of the government owned powder factory in Augusta.  He also relates information about private industrial firms, such as the Selma Foundry, purchased and run by the government.  In both cases, private business owners were involved in either the purchase or running of these firms on the government's behalf.  The government did not control production in these cases, they just reserved the right to purchase the production, so the business owners really had more control in this relationship than government officials did.  Moreover, the lines between businessman and government official blurred as men moved back and forth in positions with both.  In addition, as Bonner explains, ""The unusual mixture on nationalized and privately owned industries symbolized the flexible nature of Confederate capitalism.""(126) </p>  <p>Moreover, as we can see from the Confederate pass system, the government grew and changed over time in response to the problems of fighting the war.  The passes, at first, were just to watch for, and control, espionage.  But, as the war continued, the pass system spread from a local to a national system that heavily impinged upon the freedom of Confederate civilians.  But, as with the use of secret sessions for Congress, Confederates were willing to curtail their own freedom for the good of the nation, at least during the war.  Moreover, we can see how as the war went on, the Confederate government organized and marshalled the people of the nation towards winning the war, the centralizing tendencies of the government to fight the war led from a small local system of passes to protect specific areas to a national organization controlled by the ever expanding power of the state. </p>   <p>The last governmental relationship that Bonner reviews is the relationship between the railroads and the Confederate authorities, perhaps one of the most important relationships that business and governmental entered into.  This relationship could have developed in many ways.  But, the railroad management dictated how the various roads would be used as part of the war effort.  They set the rates and determined usage, even in the face of governmental pressure.  As Bonner explains, ""From 1861 through 1864 Confederate railroad policy was formulated by the several conventions of self-interested railroad managers.""(181) Again, while some railroad executives were seen as profiteers, the government acquiesced to their demands as they were the only ones who understood how the rail network of the nation worked and cooperation served the needs of the Confederacy better.  Even when the public and government object to some railroad practices, railroad executives were basically given free rein to implement policies. </p>  <p>Bonner states, ""The war forced Confederate leaders to be innovative in terms of political culture, industrial policy, and their methods of mobilization and handling of the transportation network for the war effort.""(202)  Traditionally, the Confederate economy and its ability to be marshalled into a war effort for independence was seen as stunted and backwards at best.  But, instead of backwards, Bonner argues that the Confederacy was ahead of its time with the corporatist policy that it followed to try to win the war.  The interactions between the government and private business leaders mirrored events that took place much later, and, even without the participation of labor unions, as in later corporatist systems, the Confederate government and its political economy, Bonner argues, was the result of adapting to the situation at hand the best that it could, centralizing and expanding while allowing businesses free rein. </p>  <p><i>Dr. Michael Frawley teaches history at University of Texas, Permian Basin.</i></p>"	Frawley, Michael	Fall 2016	2016-11-1	Review			LSU Press		Politics;Social_History			"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=241 alt=\""Product Cover\"" border=0 src=\""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/bonnerconfedeconomy.jpg\"">"							
6626	9780700624379	$24.95	Framing the Solid South: The State Constitutional Conventions of Secession, Reconstruction, and Redemption, 1860-1902		Herron, Paul E.			"Beyond Conventions: A Less than Solid South<p>Paul E. Herron's <i>Framing the Solid South: The State Constitutional Conventions of Secession, Reconstruction, and Redemption, 1860-1902</i>, examines how State Constitutional Conventions evolved in the South. It is an ambitious book examining conventions from the antebellum through the early Jim Crow-era. Herron, a political science professor at Providence College, includes numerous tables that will be a handy reference to historians and those interested in southern states' constitutional conventions.</p>  <p>Dividing state constitutional conventions into categories of Antebellum, Secession, Reconstruction, and ""Redemption,"" Herron finds novel insights into how each set of conventions influenced the next set and shaped American legal thought. In finding how state conventions influenced each other and shaped legal thought, the book makes its biggest contributions to the field. For example, in many ways conventions from the post-Reconstruction-era, kept alive and re-reified the idea of state's rights, which remains a crucial legal issue today. He also recognizes and shows how Reconstruction --  and white conservatives aversion too anything associated with it -- had a central role in shaping southern politics for years afterwards. Reconstruction is far too often overlooked, yet it was, in many ways, as central to southern history as the Civil War.</p>  <p>The author's focus in the evolution of legal thought makes for an interesting and yet frustrating approach. <i>Framing the Solid South</i> is clearly a political science book which leads to conclusions and questions historians might not normally consider, but historians of race, racism, and Reconstruction will likely find his terminology and generalizations problematic. For example, Herron often uses ""southerner"" when he means white southerner or white conservative southerner. In one instance, Herron writes that the conventions held during Congressional Reconstruction ""fostered even more resentment against Washington and drew southerners together,"" (34) forgetting hundreds of thousands of southerners both black and white, who saw Congressional Reconstruction as a positive development, attended the conventions, and voted for ratification. In North Carolina, for example, 93,086 southerners supported ratification and were not drawn together by resentment towards the 1868 Constitution. This is part of a general problem throughout the book. In his seeking the roots of a solid South that was only created, politically at least, through massive disenfranchisement, Herron is often only reading the words of white men, which harms his analysis. Though he acknowledges this difficulty of addressing ""the diversity of the region and its people"" (239), Herron treats convention delegates as representatives of the entire South and does not seek out more diverse sources. This heavily influences his interpretation of events and is a major problem for the book as a work of history.</p><p>This problem is especially noticeable in regards to his treatment Reconstruction-era and ""Redemption"" conventions. Herron's source base, primarily the convention debates, leads him to at times present events in an older way of thinking that uncritically accepts white conservatives' version of Reconstruction and fails to fully empathize or understand the motives of other actors (for example southern Republicans). This leads him to overstate the extent of disenfranchisement among former Confederates and see Reconstruction conventions which granted more power to Federal authorities as a product of outside federal interference and not also a feature desired by the southerners who actually attended them. Reading Michael Fitzgerald's <i>Splendid Failure</i> or Eric Foner's <i>Freedom's Lawmakers</i> might have helped solve these problems by revealing the southern roots of these conventions.</p>   <p>At times the combined use of sloppy language and source bias leads <i>Framing the Solid South</i> to read almost like a work of the Dunning school. For example, Herron refers to the ""growth of national authority over state conventions"" during Reconstruction as ""federal overreach"" which resulted in a ""southern backlash"" (235). First, let me be clear, any backlash was not a southern one, but a white conservative southern one. Second, in the eyes of southern African Americans and many other southern Republicans, an already existing resistance to black enfranchisement and civil rights had necessitated the growth of national authority. The refusal to pass the 14th Amendment and creation of restrictive black codes across the former Confederacy were major impetuses for the Reconstruction Acts. Far from being an effort to ""humiliate the South"" (162) as Herron presents them, federal supremacy clauses in Reconstruction-era constitutions can best be understood as efforts to protect newly won rights and ensure no future attempts at secession, both extremely understandable goals in light of the war and presidential Reconstruction. These conventions were as much a product of southerners as they were the North. Not only did southerners write these new constitutions, but southerners had appealed to congress to overturn Presidential Reconstruction, and create a process where their rights would be protected. Some historians have argued that in retrospect the constitutions actually did not go far enough in providing for federal supremacy given what subsequently occurred during ""Redemption."" Third, white conservative resistance to national authority can be seen as continued resistance to black enfranchisement. Thus, ""Redemption"" was not so much a ""backlash"" against federal overreach but a victory in white supremacists' continued struggle to constrain African American political participation. Just as cries for protecting state's rights during secession were really about a state's rights to slavery, postwar calls for state's rights were often still about white supremacy.</p>   <p>While Herron draws attention to aspects of these conventions historians often ignore -- for example, he has a fascinating examination of the overlooked question of whether treason can be committed against a state -- the central role that race and violence have played in Southern politics is sometimes obscured by a focus on convention debates about federal versus state power. Herron's focus on evolving legal thought will not pose an issue for scholars of the era but might contribute to skewed understandings of why political power shifted among general audiences who are less well read on the topic. For example, Herron claims that ""Redemption"" conventions were the means with which ""conservatives regained control of a defeated region"" (195) despite the fact that most of these conventions occurred after conservatives had retaken control of state governments, often through fraud and violence. Conventions -- along with continued threats, violence, constitutional amendments, arguments about states' rights, and fraud -- were actually how conservatives cemented their control once they had already regained it. He recognizes that ""Redemption"" conventions had the ""primary goal of disfranchising blacks"" (212) but his narrative focus often remains on efforts to reclaim state power from federal government and the evolution of legal arguments. His narrow focus on convention debates means this is not a book for those wanting an introduction to nineteenth century southern politics but is instead for people already familiar with the historiography.</p>  <p>None of this is to say Herron is some sort of Lost Cause apologist. Herron acknowledges ""slavery, along with the rights surrounding the transport and use of human chattel in the territories, was the primary cause of the conflict between North and South"" (106) and makes clear that ""it was slavery that ultimately dictated the content of the Confederate Constitution [""and] helped drive states' rights philosophy during the early and mid-nineteenth century"" (119). Indeed, one of the strongest parts and most important interventions of his book are found in his examination of how slavery influenced antebellum state constitutions. His first chapter, for example, convincingly argues that slavery ""had a profound impact on the fundamental law"" (32) found in southern state constitutions, a contribution that will be welcomed by historians of antebellum legal thought.</p>  <p>In the later chapters, the issues of terminology and its resulting influence on analysis often distract attention from research that could otherwise be extremely revealing. This is unfortunate, as many of his arguments themselves might not be problematic if they had been made with more nuanced language and with a bit more context. Perhaps the lesson is that political scientists engaging in studies of historical topics would benefit from engaging with more historians. Despite the problems, the book is a thought-provoking contribution to political science that experts may find stimulating. Hopefully its ambitious scope will encourage more political scientists and historians to consider state conventions as a field of study.</p> <p><i>Dr. Adam H.

No doubt this is fueled by the larger issues related to race that continue to plague the national psyche.  In academia, long-needed attention has finally focused on the economics, social dynamics, and documented horrors of the American slave trade. </p><p>Ned and Constance Sublette have added their voices to this overall dialogue in a recent addition to the slave trade genre entitled <i>The American Slave Coast: A History of the Slave-Breeding Industry</i>.  It is a fairly long text ranging over 700 pages, which sets out to focus more specifically on ""A history of the slave breeding industry,"" and also reads as a general history of American slavery. </p><p>Slave breeding has been, and remains, a complicated, delicate, and difficult area of overall slave history to research and write about.  The reasons for this are myriad and have often frightened away would-be investigators or story-tellers.  The Sublettes acknowledge many of these complications, but also make it clear that they are ready to engage in a full discourse upon the subject.  They define the slave breeding industry as those who facilitated and benefitted from enslaving African-American children at birth (p. xiii), a definition that makes a certain amount of common sense, but may differ from those definitions used amongst the most serious scholars of the trade. </p><p>In telling this sweeping and horrifying story, they adopt a somewhat mixed approach which is in part linear (time), part topical (different aspects of the business), and in part geographical (Virginia, Barbados, etc.).  This choice is perhaps a good one from a research design standpoint, although from a reader's standpoint it sometimes may appear that there is difficulty in maximizing the coherence of the narrative threads, especially in a book of such length. </p><p>It is an extensively researched book, and will probably offer even experts occasional insights or facts that they may not have encountered before.  Some shorter primary documents are reproduced in their original format within the text.  There are endnotes accompanied by a fairly generous reference bibliography, which includes classic slave trade references (ex. Bancroft) as well as newer articles and authors.  It is fair to say that this text represents a significant research and writing effort on the part of the authors. </p><p>The Sublettes make plainly known some of their own biases, interpretations and feelings about the events and people they report on, so readers should not be surprised by a mild lack of objectivity.  Such reactions are not unknown in the scholarship on slavery, and particularly the slave trade -- one can see the equal difficulty scholars of other horrific histories, such as the Holocaust, have had to balance in their quest to be formal and yet still sensitive in their treatments of difficult history.  This fact should be a minor note, given the much deeper significance of the text. </p><p>One difficulty with the book is the organization, which as mentioned consists of chapters and sections that do relate to one another, but become slightly disjointed over the course of the entire text.  While it is possible that the authors might have been able to tell the story in a shorter amount of space, it is also possible that the weight and impact of their effort might have been significantly dissipated by doing so.  The individual reader will have to decide for themselves. </p><p>The Sublettes also face the challenge of needing to be experts in more than four hundred years of American and European history in order to tell the story they endeavor to share.  They admittedly can't do that, so there is no doubt that specialists in different areas may see some parts of the book as less than they could have been, or incomplete.  This should again not distract the reader from appreciating the Herculean task of trying to expose the complex threads that comprise the overall American slavery experience. </p><p>Finally, it is worth noting that the title might be a little misleading to some, as well.  After reading the book, it is apparent that the slave-breeding business was American slavery in the eyes of the Sublettes (or it quickly became so).  For those who have seen the intentional slave-breeding aspects of American slavery as its own phenomenon, the book will still leave many important questions largely unanswered: Why did Natchez, Mississippi become the center of the invisible ""sex trade"" in American slavery?  Did slave owners foreshadow and even facilitate the American Eugenics movement?  Were there specific businesses for which the raison d'être was solely slave breeding?  How can they be documented? </p><p>The Sublettes suggest some answers, but much scholarship remains to be done.  Overall, their effort is noteworthy and this book should be read by all who work in related fields of inquiry.  They will find it valuable to be familiar with as the difficult work of reconciliation and dialogue continues. </p><p><i>Jack Trammell is Associate Professor at Randolph-Macon College in Ashland, Virginia.

6351	9780806151830	$19.95	Lone Star Unionism, Dissent, and Resistance: Other Sides of Civil War Texas		De La Teja, Jesus F.			"Beyond the Confederacy: Texans and the Other Civil War <p>Though observances of the sesquicentennial of the American Civil War garnered less attention and fanfare than did centennial celebrations, both movements prompted new publications on the history of the war. While many authors commemorated the 150th anniversary of the Civil War by publishing works that differ little from traditional accounts of key battles, commanders, and the common soldier experience, others explored fresh topics that previously had received limited scholarly attention. Jesús F. de la Teja's <i>Lone Star Unionism, Dissent, and Resistance: Other Sides of the Civil War</i> belongs in the latter category.  De la Teja, noted historian of Texas history, has done a masterful job of examining the activities of Unionists and anti-Confederates living in Texas during the Civil War era, including the years immediately before and after the conflict. </p>   <p>De la Teja argues that scholarly accounts of Civil War Texas often devote too much attention to military topics, leaving scholars with an incomplete understanding of how the war impacted society.  Focusing on Texas, De la Teja argues that traditional interpretations leave the impression that only a small minority of Texans opposed Confederate authority before and during the war.  <i>Lone Star Unionism, Dissent, and Resistance</i> provides an alternative perspective, suggesting that anti-Confederate activities were more widespread than previously believed. </p>  <p>Consisting of ten well-written and well-researched chapters, this volume provides a more nuanced understanding of the Civil War era by recounting the experiences of Texans, who opposed the Confederacy, including slaves, Germans, Tejanos, African Americans, and noted white Unionists.  While all the chapters in this study provide new insights, some are exceptional.  Laura McLemore's chapter, ""Gray Ghost: Creating a Collective Memory of a Confederate Texas,"" provides an excellent analysis of the problems associated with the collective memory of Texas' role in the <parConfederacy.  She convincingly argues that Texans in the postwar years were less tied to the concept of the Lost Cause than many scholars contend.  McLemore reveals that ""women, who increasingly saw themselves as the guardians of the state's heritage,"" were left ""to construct that public memory"" (8).  However, she also claims that even women's organizations, such as the United Daughters of the Confederacy, were more interested in fostering ""a sense of culture and appreciation for the state's history and women's place in it than to tie Texas to the Lost Cause bandwagon"" (8).  Likewise, using an abundance of newspaper advertisements related to runaway slaves, as well as military and political correspondence, Andrew Torget discusses the interactions between white slaveholders and their bondsmen.  His chapter, ""The Problem of Slave Flight in Civil War Texas,"" suggests that the fear of an uncontrollable slave population heavily influenced the actions and behaviors of white Texans, including the consideration of conscripting blacks into the Confederate army toward the war's end.  In ""New Americans or New Southerners? Unionist German Texans,"" Walter Kamphoefner offers new insights on the German population in the state, suggesting that Germans, who immigrated to Texas between 1840 and 1860, faced the challenge of simultaneously being Americans and Texans.  Contesting traditional scholarly trends, Kamphoefner concludes that Texas Germans did not possess a natural inclination toward slavery, nor the southern cause.  Finally, Omar Valerio-Jiménez's ""'Although We Are the Last Soldiers': Citizenship, Ideology, and Tejano Unionism"" challenges historical perceptions of the behaviors of Mexican Texans.  Valerio-Jiménez concludes that Tejano Unionists opposed the Confederacy based on their antislavery beliefs and the malevolent treatment that they had endured in the antebellum years at the hands of local and state authorities. </p>   <p>Readers will likely find that other chapters cover familiar ground.  Richard McCaslin's ""A Texas Reign of Terror: Anti-Unionist Violence in North Texas,"" which discusses the 1862 Great Hanging in and near Gainesville, Texas, is well written and informative; however, the chapter does not significantly add to his previously published works on the topic.  Also, W. Caleb McDaniel's ""Involuntary Removals: 'Refugeed Slaves' in Confederate Texas"" provides few revelations on the subject of refugee slaves entering Texas with their owners, an exodus that resulted when slaveholders from other southern states fled their plantations prior to the arrival of advancing Union armies.  Additionally, some readers may question why the editor included topics that might seem more suited for a study of Reconstruction Texas.  Such chapters include: Rebecca Czuchry's ""In Defense of Their Families: African American Women, the Freedmen's Bureau, and Racial Violence during Reconstruction in Texas,"" Elizabeth Turner's ""'Three Cheers to Freedom and Equal Rights to All': Juneteenth and the Meaning of Citizenship,"" and Carl Moneyhon's ""Edmund J. Davis -- Unlikely Radical.""  However, the editor provides a viable explanation for the inclusion of these chapters.  Supporting an argument that this reviewer has held for many years, De la Teja contends that the Civil War did not end in 1865, but rather continued through the Reconstruction years.  Accordingly, the editor contends that stories of those who opposed the racial and political beliefs of unreconstructed southerners following the war deserve as much attention as anti-secessionist and anti-Confederate activities before and during the conflict. </p> <p><i>Lone Star Unionism, Dissent, and Resistance</i> is an excellent example of how scholars can bring new life to a familiar topic.  This study serves to reminds readers of the fallacy of the argument that a monolithic pro-Confederate Texas existed during the Civil War era.  As such, this volume will be of particular interest to all serious students of Texas and Civil War history. </p> <p><i>Dr. Kenneth W.

6400	9780820345574	$49.95	Black Woman Reformer: Ida B. Wells, Lynching, and Transatlantic Activism		Silkey, Sarah L.			"Beyond the Water's Edge: Ida B. Wells and the Renewal of Transatlantic Activism	<p>In what may have been the darkest period of race relations after the Civil War, the mid-1890s, a flaring light of exposure and protest burst forth when Ida B. Wells published her exposures of lynch law and its connection not to lawlessness or rape, but to race.  Potential readers who give the go-by to Sarah Silkey's <i>Black Woman Reformer: Ida B. Wells, Lynching, & Transatlantic Activism</i> because it would seem to cover long-trodden ground, do not know what they are missing. Concentrating more on how Wells's work inspired an international debate, this monograph handles a narrow aspect of that story, but with stimulating effect.	<p>Whatever the title may suggest, this book is not so much about Ida B. Wells as about the transmission of ideas, of British perceptions of American mobbing and their response to her work on the one side, and the way defenders of the South and lynch law tried to counter that reaction overseas.  In Britain, as in America, news reports and published confessions linked lynching to a system of rough justice, the victims singled out for their nefarious deeds and rightly punished. A crude respectability, bestowed all the more willingly because the frontier, not the South, took foremost place when people thought of vigilantism, allowed British opinion to grow complacent.  Yet even before Wells's appearance on public platforms in England, doubts were breaking forth, intensified by the excuse, new to foreigners and unconvincing, that only extralegal terror could cope with the epidemic of rapes that supposedly afflicted the South.</p> <p>Wells's appearance thus came at just the right time, and it was helped by her ability to fit her cause into the growing acceptability of ladies engaging in reform movements  -- conditional on their behaving like ladies.  Made the more respectable by the endorsement of the widely respected patriarch from antislavery days, Frederick Douglass. Wells not only found a friendly hearing, but she rekindled memories of the last great transatlantic cause, the abolition of slavery.</p> 	<p>As English denunciations of lynching sharpened, from the South came a counter-barrage. Southern whites were not just defending their section against foreign attack.  They realized the pocketbook consequences of a bad image in Britain, from which so much of the investment flowed that a New South desperately needed.  Aware that Wells's status as a lady and a living refutation of the image of blacks as irredeemably degraded lay at the heart of her influence abroad, polemicists tried to blacken her morals.  More than ever, they tried to tie vigilantism to the victimization of white womanhood. When neither line of attack succeeded, apologists lashed into Britons as meddlers and hypocrites, whose sympathies might better be turned to the outrages just across the Irish Sea.</p> 	<p>It cannot be said that Wells's overseas allies created a sea-change. Indeed, a pause in her efforts allowed British public opinion to turn its attention elsewhere, if, indeed, it could ever have been continued.  From Silkey's research, nothing shows that the South lost out on investment from abroad to any measurable extent because of her crusade. Readers may find that the book's conjecture that Wells ""forced the South as a whole to pause to consider the potential economic, political and social ramifications of its brutal treatment of African Americans,"" showing that ""communities that supported mob violence faced negative consequences"" (p. 143) more wishful thinking than anything proven or, indeed provable.  If the British critique persisted and revived in the early twentieth century, it was a harassment that a Jim Crow South found itself able to bear without any statistically measurable effects.</p> <p>Yet Silkey is on to something crucially important, so much so that it is a shame that <i>Black Woman Reformer</i> did not expand its scope beyond the controversy over the rights and wrongs of racial vigilantism. Her examination of British editorial opinion expands our historical knowledge of an area hitherto too little explored, the transatlantic character of reform.  With a few honorable exceptions, scholarship has treated activism as if it stopped at the water's edge, and most of the exceptions cover the period before the Civil War, when much in the abolitionist movement, including the  antislavery society's emblem and its slogan, ""Am I not a man and a brother?"" came from English efforts to end first the slave trade and then the concept of human property itself.   Some work has been done on the settlement house movement, less on tenement reform and temperance, but the subject, as Silkey's work makes clear, is far from exhausted and would prove quite fruitful.  Without that attention, the general perception of reform movements will remain so deeply rooted in American traditions and concerns that the larger interlocking character of those movements will go unappreciated and, indeed, misunderstood. The fact is, a country that prided itself as an example to all the world and towards which many democrats elsewhere looked for models to apply to their own societies cared deeply how others perceived them and saw economic consequences in losing their good opinion.</p> 	<p>Dr. Silkey, an assistant professor at Lycoming College, writes well and affectingly, and if most of her sources are published, what else should we expect in assessing public debate? Even her acknowledgments -- the part of any book that readers are likeliest to skip -- are a gem: where else will one find an encomium to Piglet and a comparison of the Very Small Animal to Wells herself, in having the courage that, even if they blinched, ""only blinched inside"" (p. ix)?  No student of the least gilded part of America's Gilded Age or of English conscience in an equally dark age of overseas empire, should overlook this impressive book.</p><p><i>Mark W.

6517	9780803295858	$65.00	Unpopular Sovereignty: Mormons and the Federal Management of Early Utah Territory		Rogers, Brent M.			"Bleeding Utah?: The Importance of Mormon Utah in Antebellum U.S. Politics	<p>Mormon history is firmly rooted in, and a distinct product of, U.S. history.  Yet, for much of the twentieth century, nineteenth-century United States historiography and nineteenth-century Mormon historiography have remained frustratingly apart. U.S. historians barely discussed the Mormons in their syntheses, while Mormon historians rarely cast their eyes beyond the narrow (albeit fascinating) confines of the early LDS Church and its adherents.  In recent decades, scholars have done much to bring the two histories together, as topics such as Joseph Smith and the origins of Mormonism, polygamy, the Mormon Trail, and Mormon theories of government have all been placed in a wider American framework, yielding intriguing and fruitful results.  Early Utah Territory, however, has stubbornly persisted in scholarly isolation.  In many ways, this isolation makes sense, as Mormon leaders moved to the Great Basin <i>to be isolated</i>.  Yet, as Brent Rogers, a documentary editor of the Joseph Smith Papers at the LDS Church History Library, demonstrates in his impressively researched new book <i>Unpopular Sovereignty: Mormons and the Federal Management of Early Utah Territory</i>, the drama of 1850s Utah was entangled with the drama of the 1850s United States.  Rogers' wide-ranging study skillfully integrates the history of the antebellum United States with Mormon and Native-controlled Utah Territory, and definitively establishes that the 1857 Utah War was indeed a national event -- one that informed the larger debate over popular sovereignty and slavery in the decade preceding the Civil War.</p>   	<p>The title of Rogers' book is an appropriate one, for the concept of sovereignty infuses all aspects of the book, and as a framing device it holds the study's expansive elements together.  In this approach, Rogers is aided by antebellum Americans' own rhetoric that also returned time and again to sovereignty.  Hoping to secure a railroad through his native Illinois, Senator Stephen Douglas orchestrated passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which repealed the Missouri Compromise and opened up Kansas Territory to ""popular sovereignty.""  To Douglas and much of the Democratic Party, popular sovereignty offered a permanent solution to the issue of slavery's expansion by giving territorial inhabitants a vote on slavery's legality in the territory in which they resided, thereby removing the federal government from the decision-making process.  Meanwhile, having been forced from U.S. borders in 1846, the Mormons asserted their own sovereignty in the remote Great Basin, at that time claimed but not controlled by Mexico.  When the United States gained title to the Great Basin in 1848, Mormon leaders hoped to make what they termed Deseret a state in the Union.  By securing statehood, the Mormons would elect their own officials, manage their own marital practices, and essentially govern themselves.  However, U.S. officials remained wary of Mormon intentions.  Rather than approve Deseret as a state, Congress created Utah Territory, for territorial status would allow greater federal control over the Mormons.  Rogers brings together these seemingly unrelated events in Kansas and Utah by demonstrating that, in response to the creation of Utah Territory, Mormon leaders seized on the doctrine of popular sovereignty as the next best alternative to statehood, arguing that its core principal of federal noninterference in the territories did not just apply to slavery in Kansas, but to Mormon practices in Utah.  With the Mormons seeking self-sovereignty, and federal policymakers refusing to grant it, the stage was set for the Utah War.</p>   	<p>Rogers locates the U.S.-Mormon struggle over sovereignty in Utah Territory in three areas: first, the implementation of republican government; second, regulations over marriage and the family -- in particular, the struggle over the Mormon doctrine of plural marriage; and third, control of Native American affairs.  In regards to the first two, the book differs from other studies in more its emphases than its broader arguments.  The battles over who would wield political power in Utah, and how it would be wielded, have been detailed before, but Rogers makes a more forceful distinction between American republicanism and the Mormon ""authoritarian theocratic alternative"" (62) -- which was not a ""theo-democracy,"" as the Mormons publicly stated then and many scholars have continued to argue today.  Ultimately, Rogers contends that federal and Mormon political goals were fundamentally incompatible.  Polygamy, too, has been the subject of many books on Mormon Utah, but Rogers' insertion of sovereignty provides an illuminating integration of the Mormons' internal gender dynamics with both Mormon-U.S. Army relations and U.S. national politics.  According to Rogers, the clash over plural marriage was fundamentally a fight for Mormon (male) sovereignty, for sovereignty presumed control over the domestic sphere -- in this case, Mormon men's control over Mormon women (84).</p>    	<p>Of the three sovereignty locales, <i>Unpopular Sovereignty</i>'s investigation of Mormon-Native-federal relations is the most novel and also the most fascinating.  This clash, unlike that over government and marriage, was a tripartite struggle, as the Utes, Shoshones, and other Great Basin Natives competed with the Mormons and the federal government for sovereignty.  Moreover, both Mormon leaders and federal officials believed that only the sovereign power in Utah Territory had a right to engage in Indian diplomacy, and thus they competed with one another for influence among Utah's Natives.  When treating with Indians, Mormons consistently argued that they were fundamentally different from Americans, which in turn proved to federal officials -- albeit in most cases erroneously -- that a Mormon-Indian alliance was in the making (an assertion that plagued the Mormons since their troubles in Missouri in the 1830s).  President Buchanan cited Mormon control of Indian affairs as one of the primary reasons to justify an army expedition to Utah.  Ironically, in the war's aftermath, after federal officials finally did wrest control of Native relations from the Mormons, it was the Mormons who now believed in an anti-Mormon U.S.-Indian alliance (258).  Rogers skillfully interweaves the story of Utah's Indians with both Mormons and federal officials to provide a fascinating portrait of the wider geopolitics of early Utah Territory, and his sifting of evidence to determine in what fashion Mormons did indeed make substantial diplomatic inroads with Utah's Natives is particularly adroit.</p>   	<p>While Rogers' narrative of confrontations over sovereignty on the ground in Utah Territory comprises a majority of the book's contents, readers interested primarily in Utah's connection to antebellum politics will be drawn to his discussion of how Utah sovereignty impacted the slavery debate in the United States.  In assessing the Buchanan administration's decision to initiate the Utah War, Rogers asserts that it was undeniably legal and probably justified, but it was ""not a politically savvy maneuver"" (181).  The Utah War exposed the central hypocrisy at the heart of Democrats' popular sovereignty doctrine: if Kansans possessed the power to decide on slavery's legality in their territory, why did the Mormons not possess power over their own affairs in Utah?   Quoting from an extensive array of antebellum newspapers, Rogers demonstrates that many Americans immediately recognized the inconsistency.  For antislavery northerners, Utah revealed popular sovereignty as, in Lincoln's words, ""nothing but a humbug"" that existed simply as cover for slavery's expansion (170).  For anxious southerners, the Utah War demonstrated the real weakness of popular sovereignty as a legal concept.  No matter how much Buchanan and Douglas championed the doctrine as providing self-governance for a territory, from a legal standpoint a territory still remained permanently subject to the federal government.  And, if the federal government could wield martial power to interfere with the Mormons' ""other peculiar institution"" of polygamy, then perhaps it could interfere with <i>the</i> peculiar institution in the South.  In the end, claims Rogers, the Utah War ""irreparably harmed the viability of popular sovereignty as a political concept"" (280).</p>  	<p>Beyond Rogers' attention to sovereignty, his book possesses several other strengths.  First, it presents a clear but sophisticated analysis of legal and constitutional issues in the relationship between Utah and the United States.  Rogers not only addresses the nuances of the popular sovereignty doctrine and the legal status of territories, but also topics such as the Mormon rejection of common law in Utah Territory, the application of the 1834 Trade and Intercourse Act to Utah affairs, and the connections between the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act and the Homestead Act.  Additionally, Rogers' assessment that the Utah War was a decisive federal victory over the Mormons, and for federal power in the West more generally, is convincing, and his final chapter on the growth of this power provides a seamless segue to studies that explore the struggle over polygamy in Utah after the Civil War, now the sole locale of sovereignty the Mormons still contested.</p>  	<p>Despite all of its strengths, I was only partially convinced by one of <i>Unpopular Sovereignty</i>'s central arguments that the Utah War decisively exposed the hypocrisies of popular sovereignty.  Undoubtedly, Rogers proves that events in Utah <i>mattered</i> to antebellum Americans, often a great deal.  The Republican platform decrying the ""twin relics of barbarism"" was in fact concerned with <i>both</i> of these relics, and it is a testament to Rogers' scholarship that any new synthesis seeking to describe the countdown to the Civil War must now include the Utah War.  But did the Utah War really <i>prove</i> to Americans the flaws in popular sovereignty, or simply <i>confirm</i> them?  To many Americans, Bleeding Kansas was proof enough.  Moreover, Rogers scarcely discusses <i>Scott v. Sandford</i> (165), a decision that the Supreme Court delivered in March of 1857, the same month as Buchanan initiated the Utah War.  While the Utah War may have exposed popular sovereignty as hypocritical, Taney's opinion essentially declared popular sovereignty unconstitutional: no territory (or state) could prevent slaveowners from bringing slaves across its borders, no matter the will of its citizens.  It was this decision that ultimately destroyed popular sovereignty's viability.  Tellingly, while Rogers cites extensive newspapers to show the importance of Utah in antebellum politics, these citations are clustered around 1857, suggesting that its significance in the national dialogue rapidly diminished in the final years before secession.  Although it entered and influenced the national conversation over slavery, for most Americans Utah Territory remained far away, and ultimately their attention turned to events and decisions that hit much closer to home.</p>   	 <p>Like all good works of history, <i>Unpopular Sovereignty</i> raises as many questions as it answers, particularly in regards to Utah's place within the wider U.S. West.  At various points Rogers places Utah not only alongside Kansas, but also other U.S. territories.  He compares, for example, the U.S. approach to Catholicism in New Mexico with its approach to Mormonism in Utah (56), and Oregon's provisional government with the provisional state of Deseret (42-43).  As Rogers admits, these brief comparisons are not the primary purpose of his work, but they undoubtedly offer lines for further inquiry about the broader status of the territories in the late 1840s and 1850s.  Utah, perhaps, was not as exceptional as scholars may have assumed, but we will only know with further study.</p>   	<p>Ultimately, <i>Unpopular Sovereignty</i> is a noteworthy addition to both U.S. and Mormon historiography, and will be the vital text on early Utah Territory's important place in the American Union for years to come.  Rogers must be commended for this fine effort.</p>	<p><i>Thomas Richards, Jr. is the 2017-2018 David J.

6334	9781469625423	$34.95	Ku-Klux: The Birth of the Klan during Reconstruction		Parsons, Elaine Frantz			"Born in Violence, Remade in Terror: The KKK and the National Imagination<p>With <i>Ku-Klux</i>, Elaine Frantz Parsons has made a substantial contribution not only to our understanding of the Klan's origins, but to the deeper meanings behind the national perceptions of this secret, terrorist organization as it circulated in the pages of northern newspapers during the era of Reconstruction. Though the author accepts the general chronology of the original Klan, established by Allen Trelease in <i>White Terror</i>, Parsons focuses on the discourse surrounding Klan violence rather than the group's organizational features. She demonstrates that Ku-Klux violence was ""embedded in a broader national culture,"" rather than an organic creation born solely of the American South (20). At its core, this book is a product of the cultural turn and it uncovers the cultural ramifications of postwar white fury and how it manifested itself in, and was explained by, northern and southern newspapers. </p>  <p>The book is arranged in seven chapters with an introduction and conclusion. Parsons focuses on four major northern newspapers in this study: the <i>Chicago Times</i> (Democratic), the <i>Milwaukee Daily Sentinel</i>, the <i>New York Times</i>, and the <i>New York Tribune</i> (all Republican, though with different degrees of support for the party's ""radical"" arm). To prove the interest of the northern press in the Ku-Klux Klan, Parsons identifies more than three thousand articles published in these northern papers before 1873. In addition to newspaper analysis, Parsons also presents the findings of federal investigations and the testimonies taken from the African American victims of Ku-Klux violence and their white allies. Beyond more traditional data such as this, Parsons employs multiple ""visualization[s] of the connections"" between criminals in Union, South Carolina (the location of study in the last two chapters) and men of property in order to demonstrate cross-class interests within the local white community. Each visualization utilizes network metrics via Gephi -- a digital analysis tool which allows users to input data and arrange it into visualizations in order to reconstruct and clarify the configuration of a particular social group. Through this type of analysis Parsons shows just how connected white outlaws and elites could have been, and often times were, by locating prominent members of a subculture of violent criminals -- whose names appeared most frequently in the Union County courthouse records -- with men of higher social standing, such as a local hotel proprietor, for example. This book, then, represents a welcome way to combine multiple historical methods into a cogent narrative. </p>  <p>In the first chapter, Parsons revisits and challenges the truths historians have generally accepted regarding the origins of the first Ku-Klux, however indistinct, which was formed in Pulaski, Tennessee. Rather than formed by a group of ruffians, Parsons argues that men such as Frank McCord -- local publisher of the <i>Pulaski Citizen</i> -- were elite members of the community. Rather than well-organized and politically oriented, as historians have previously agreed, the Pulaski Klan was not only ineffective and mostly performative, but the progenitor's efforts at self-publicity failed to reach a larger audience. Only once rumblings of the Ku-Klux entered the national press did the organization gain general attention and thus a reputation for organization and violence. </p>  <p>In the second and third chapters, Parsons describes the concerted violence perpetrated by the Ku-Klux from 1868 to 1871, and how it attempted to redefine white and black manhood in the South as well as the nation at large. Of utmost importance, the author details how these men used ""physical force to break down specific bodies that housed memories, sensations, words, and wills and that enabled them to feed and house themselves and their dependents"" (72). The very mystery that the Ku-Klux evoked with masks and bizarre costumes -- sometimes men even donned women's clothes -- was meant not only to intimidate their victims, but also as a way to define themselves and to project that identity into the national imagination. When federal investigators ventured to southern towns to collect victim testimony of Ku-Klux violence, the depositions often reinforced the idea of racial inferiority as those testifying curtailed their words as a means to remain safe in the communities where they continued to live after investigators departed. Ku-Kluxism exhibited multiple cultural meanings, Parsons argues, including the broader message of recalcitrance and obstructionism for radical Republicans in Washington. </p>  <p>In the fourth and fifth chapters Parsons fleshes out the motivations and interpretations of printing Ku-Klux stories in northern newspapers, as well as how the idea of the Klan evolved over time. Democrats and Republicans interpreted instances of Ku-Klux violence in accordance with their own political goals. As Parsons writes, Democrats favored ""an organization less robust and political and Republicans""one more robust and political"" (153). Of utmost interest, Ku-Klux discourse became a lens through which to view -- and criticize -- the expanding nation-state. Federal investigations of Ku-Klux violence in the South only bolstered burgeoning ideas of the government's growth as well as its supposed overreach with the Enforcement Acts, for example. Parsons also powerfully asserts that skepticism and outright denial of the Klan ""became a way for Americans to critique governmental information-gathering mechanisms and the postwar press as unreliable"" (182). That national presses battled over the actions and messages of the Klan suggests that the organization had a national presence well before the Second Klan of the 1920s, if only temporarily. </p>    <p>The final two chapters return from the arena of publicly constructed identity to the actuality of Ku-Klux violence in Union County, South Carolina. Parsons describes how the advent of able African American leadership challenged the power of whites within the South Carolina Upcountry. It was in response to this perceived threat to white authority that, Parsons argues, forced Union County elites to acquiesce to the interests of the white criminal underclass. Through African American participation in the Republican Party, including Union Leagues and black militias, whites became fearful of black-on-white violence and took forceful measures to disperse black organization in general. Prominent African American Republicans served as state representatives and local judges, and informal associations of African American men who provided protection for their leaders displayed the power of effective black associations. Replete with picnic raids, jail raids, and alleged ambushes, the violent clashes in Union County's history serve as an appropriate laboratory within which to test how national discourse affected local circumstance. Ku-Klux response to the actions of African Americans and the portrayal of this violence in the press attracted federal attention. State officials and federal authorities imprisoned a healthy number of Ku-Klux culprits under the Enforcement Acts, yet white Democrats ultimately attained their goal of removing African Americans from power. </p>  <p>This unfortunate paradox captures what is at the center of <i>Ku-Klux</i>: the emergence of the Klan and its portrayal in the national press ""marked the inevitability of white dominance and the tragicomic nature of black aspiration"" (304). Though common violence would remain, the Klan reached its peak and receded in the early 1870s, and white Americans who thought themselves the proper inheritors of power returned to fight over the spoils of supremacy as the pillars of Reconstruction crumbled. </p>  <p><i>Ku-Klux</i> grapples with complex webs of identity produced on multiple levels, both local and national. For this reason, this book would be a welcome addition to any reading list for a graduate seminar, especially one focusing on cultural history. Also, any scholars interested in the relationship between the nineteenth century press and the public sphere may find this book indispensable. Readers today may relate this episode in Reconstruction with modern culture wars, as Americans continue to debate the origins, meanings, and consequences of violent reactions to racial friction in the United States. </p> <p><i>Joshua S.

His main characters are elite Bostonians -- the so-called Brahmins -- whose families had become rich in previous decades via merchant enterprise and textile manufacturing.  After the Civil War, Maggor shows, some of these Brahmins became important investors in the American West, where they became major players in stockyards, railroads, and copper mines.  Meanwhile, at home in Boston, the Brahmins and their allies sought to maintain their local authority, and limit their tax bills, by engaging in urban politics.  Tracing the activities of the Brahmins and their opponents at multiple levels -- local, state, and continental -- Maggor's book portrays the elite Bostonians of the late nineteenth century as aggressive, enterprising capitalists, bent on maximizing their own wealth and power.</p><p>Moving back and forth between East and West, the book's narrative reinforces its arguments about the deep connections between the two regions.  In the first and third chapters, Maggor describes the Brahmins' successful efforts, in the 1870s and 1880s, to find new investment opportunities in the West.  One chapter concentrates on the Western adventures of one young Brahmin, Henry Davis Minot, who spent much of the 1880s traveling the continent, accumulating knowledge on behalf of Boston investors.  Minot and his peers helped to maintain the fortunes of the Brahmins, well into the future, by making Boston an important center of finance capital.</p>  <p>Despite its attention to the far West, this book is also concerned with municipal politics back East, in Boston.  This is the subject of the book's second, fourth, and sixth chapters, which describe local struggles over annexation, tax reform, schools, and the use of public space.  The central story in these chapters concerns the efforts of the Brahmins to limit their own taxes.  Maggor concludes that they ended up having good success in this endeavor, but not without encountering stiff opposition.  Throughout the book, Maggor emphasizes the importance of democratic politics, which allowed a variety of non-elites to stand up to the Brahmins.  This challenge was mounted not just in Boston, but also in the far West.  The Western part of this story of political contestation is told in the book's fifth chapter, which describes the proceedings of the original constitutional conventions in new states such as Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming.</p><p>Maggor claims that <i>Brahmin Capitalism</i> breaks new ground not only by providing an original account of Eastern capital in the West, but also by showing that the making of national markets was contingent and contested.  This seems to at least slightly misrepresent the current state of scholarship, which now contains several decades' worth of studies with a similar perspective on the politics of economic development.  This is evident from Maggor's own notes, as is the fact that there is a valuable, older monographic literature tracing the importance of Eastern capital (including Boston capital specifically) in the nineteenth-century West.  So it would seem that an important part of Maggor's impressive achievement in the book is his success in blending original interpretation with synthesis.</p><p>The research presented in the book is creative and original, and is in many ways impressive, particularly for its attention to multiple geographic spaces and levels of American politics.  However, in several parts of the book, the evidence is too limited to sustain some of Maggor's most ambitious claims.  Most individual chapters are based on very close readings of a relatively small number of texts.  This approach allows Maggor to offer rich accounts of specific episodes and characters, but this focus can come at the cost of insufficient attention to broader contexts.  Some standard sources that might have provided more context, such as newspapers and legal cases, seem underused.</p><p>In the end, this book presents a blunt political story, with little room for nuance, in which selfish capitalists did battle with good democrats, including craftspeople, farmers, and small business owners.  Ethnicity and religion are seldom discussed in this book, which is focused squarely on class.  Maggor, like other historians of the late nineteenth century, are surely justified in claiming that their studies deserve special attention today, in a new age of finance capitalism and extreme inequalities.  Some readers may find fault with certain aspects of Maggor's account, but all will gain from engaging with this well-crafted, provocative book.</p><p><i>Mark R.

6399	9780806152240	$34.95	Serving the Nation: Cherokee Sovereignty and Social Welfare, 1800-1907		Reed, Julie L.			"Citizen and Nation: Cherokee Welfare Reconsidered <p>In <i>Serving the Nation</i>, Julie Reed, assistant professor of history at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, examines how the Cherokees debated and devised social policies within the Cherokee Nation over the course of the nineteenth century. At the heart of traditional Cherokee communal ethos were <i>gadugi</i>, or work coordinated for the social good, and <i>osdv iyunvnehi</i>, social policy predicated on matrilineality, egalitarianism, and commitment to communal landholdings.  <i>Serving the Nation</i> explores how these traditions helped shape the alternative social welfare system the Cherokees created while facing a series of challenges from national reformers and federal policies. Reed pays special attention to the impact of legislation and services on the people served by them. In addition, she examines the interplay between the Cherokee people with their own nationally controlled social services and institutions. Finally, she addresses the ways in which the Cherokee institutions forced conversations in the region and at the federal level over social welfare.  Utilizing the methodology of ethnohistory, Reed relies heavily on materials by the Cherokees themselves and documents produced within Indian Territory. Especially important is the inclusion of voices generally overlooked in favor of the elites, including women and those served by the institutions. The picture that emerges is one of complexity and Cherokee agency as they ""imagine[d] a viable alternative to the social policies offered by federal officials and states"" (p. 15). Reed suggests that these debates influenced how federal officials approached their delivery of social provisions.</p>    <p>The book opens with an exploration of the internal debates about social welfare concerns and the larger threat of removal that eventually divided the Cherokee Nation. As other scholars have pointed out, class, race, and political schism informed debates and decisions in the Nation. Yet, Reed argues that different means did not mean different ends. Social welfare debates all focused on the same central question: who has the responsibility, the rights and the ability to assume care for other Cherokees. So, while influenced by national reforms, the Cherokee Nation established institutions to serve orphans, the (dis)abled, and incarcerated. These institutions advocated on behalf of Cherokee citizens and took care of them, based on the traditional communal ethos. The 1829 Constitution consolidated the authority of the Nation in delivering social services, intricately intertwining the political entity -- the Cherokee Nation -- with the social welfare of Cherokee citizens.</p>    <p>Faced with the crisis of removal and the imposition of individual land ownership, the community mustered its collective will to care for its people. In chapter 2, Reed examines Cherokee resistance to removal and the political and social crisis that followed. Importantly, the Treaty of New Echota, signed by the Removal party in 1835, laid the groundwork for Cherokee administration of social services by placing fiscal control and implementation of educational and orphan projects with the Nation, not an outside entity. Under the leadership of Principal Chief John Ross, the Nation began rebuilding its institutional structure, amidst the challenges of population loss, social chaos, and financial crisis following removal.  The subsequent Civil War further challenged Cherokee people's faith in each other and their social safety nets. Chapter 3 specifically examines the Treaty of 1866 with the United States and reassesses its impact on social policy in the Nation. While this treaty diminished aspects of Cherokee sovereignty, the leadership gained the political, economic and legal framework that secured them a space within the United States and outside of it as a sovereign Cherokee Nation.</p>    <p>In Chapter 4, Reed outlines the social policy changes following the Treaty of 1866. These changes occurred against the backdrop of new threats: territorialization provisions; arrival of the railroads; and yet another shift in federal policy to reservations. The chapter focuses on the New Codes, legal reforms prompted by the need to manage the social provisions in the Treaty, influenced by national reforms but with a Cherokee imprint. She also argues that this institutional structure, in a sense, helped in the process of healing the Nation by forging ties between the Nation and its citizens. Chapter 5 focuses on life at the Cherokee orphanage, the prison, and the Asylum for the Deaf, Dumb, Blind, and the Insane at a time when they had moved beyond their infancy. The chapter is alive with people who inhabited the institutions, both residents and staff. Their stories give the reader a keen sense of Cherokees interacting across age, lingual, familial, racial, and class divides. These interactions helped build their sense of community and identity as Cherokees. Reed also examines how the institutions reflected the Nation's engagement with national reform efforts. While the Cherokee leaders subscribed to many of the same beliefs as white, middle-class, Protestant reformers, they privileged a community ethic modeled on Cherokee values. As a result, Cherokee institutions educated without ""oppression,"" allowing Cherokees to remain Cherokees. Yet, race, class, gender, and language played a role in access to and experiences in these institutions.</p>   <p>Changes in federal Indian policy in the 1880s and the arrival of the Dawes commissioners to negotiate allotment and statehood in 1893 further threatened Cherokee nationhood. In Chapter 6, Reed points out that, more than anything, these attacks threatened to dismantle the alternative social policy that prioritized the needs of the Cherokee citizenry, poignantly illustrating the connection between the Nation as a political entity and its social policy. As Reed writes, ""The Nation was a social policy enacted by Indian people, in and of itself"" (p. 200). Cherokees utilized a variety of strategies to confront the formidable opposition of railroad interests, territorialization, and reformers combined. They emphasized commonalities between Cherokee and national institutions; they wrote in newspapers; they published pamphlets advertising their successes; they supported the value of their services using fiscal records; they used institutional hospitality to convince reformers and American officials of the merits of their institutions; they made astute parallels between American concerns over mass immigration and Cherokee  demands to remove intruders from their Nation. To them, the problem was not ""the Indian"" but American policy. This chapter powerfully counters the stereotype of ""Indians as victims doomed to an ongoing existence as state and federal welfare recipients"" (p. 15). Instead, it presents Cherokees as people with an acute sense of their own worth, and the worth of their institutions.</p>   <p>The federal allotment policy threatened to dismantle key features of Cherokee social policy by eradicating communal land ownership while the efforts at territorialization directly threatened sovereignty. Negotiating these challenges, the Nation continued its obligations to the people while aligning its institutional practices more closely with those of the northeastern reformers to defend itself against critics on the outside. As demonstrated in chapter 7, these changes came at a high cost to the average Cherokees who lacked external channels to voice their concerns and, even more so, to those within the institutions and with the least access to traditional social welfare. Even when advocating policies that benefited these constituents, the voices that controlled the debate belonged to the well-educated, middle-class, and affluent men. Yet, Reed also argues that the activities of the Cherokee people collectively, the ""Real People,"" informed these debates as they continued to express their views, consent and dissent to the leaders. Therefore, Cherokee responses to allotment, examined in Chapter 8, represented a wide-spread commitment to the community ethic. Reed documents ""an endless capacity for creative resistance"" to a process that most Cherokees rejected and an ""equally creative ability to regenerate solutions to the social welfare crises"" produced by the passage of the Curtis Act in 1898 (p. 234). In the short-term, Cherokee people maintained a voice in their institutions. Over time, Cherokees lost to the individualistic approach to social welfare that followed allotment and statehood in 1907. While Cherokee welfare institutions were not perfect, Reed argues, they were ""ten times better"" because Cherokee people devised, built, supported and contested them. Thus, the institutions served their needs on their own terms. They were ""ten times better"" because they communicated the value of being Cherokee and the importance of Cherokee sovereignty.</p>    <p>This book offers an engaging treatment of the Cherokee Nation and its approach to social policy while also providing insight into the workings of a national social welfare system. Especially valuable is the insight into the complexities of building the Cherokee Nation. Reed explores the challenges of race, class and gender with an open mind, presenting a picture of Cherokees as complex actors in their own story. The institutions they developed certainly shared characteristics of the national social services, aiming to reorient the Cherokees. More importantly, they operated at the will of the Cherokee people and within the boundaries of their own nation. The book thus presents a compelling story of resilience and self-determination in the face of challenges to the traditional communal ethos.</p>  <p><i>Päivi Hoikkala, Ph.D., teaches in the History Department at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona.

6575	1609384350	$20.38	The Sacred Cause of Union: Iowa in the Civil War		Baker, Thomas R.			"Civil War Iowa Defined	<p>Thomas R. Baker has written the first history of Iowa in the Civil War.  Remarkably, no historian has explored the subject until Baker's <i>The Sacred Cause of Union: Iowa in the Civil War</i>.  Baker is the associate dean of students at the University of Iowa and not a trained historian.  However, his book is an important one and a useful addition to the literature on the conflict.  It is focused on political and military history.  The social history of the Iowa home front receives relatively little attention.  Despite this, the book's strengths far outweigh any criticism.</p>	<p>Baker provides a thorough review of the important role that Iowa soldiers played in Union victory.  He argues that Iowans supported the North because of a ""cult of unionism"" which was nearly a religious obsession.  He writes that Iowans would have gone to war with New England if that region had fired upon a federal fort in Boston Harbor.  While this point is debatable -- and ignores decades of simmering regional tensions -- such interpretations are easily forgiven due to Baker's strong research and clear narrative.</p>	<p><i>The Sacred Cause of Union</i> follows the story of six individuals throughout the war, who are diverse in their backgrounds and experiences.  Several of them are well known to those who study the state, including Alexander Clark and Annie Wittenmyer.  Clark was a noted African-American leader in Iowa, a businessman, abolitionist, and reformer who fought against discrimination.  Wittenmyer dedicated herself to aiding the Union cause during the war, agitating for improved medical care for soldiers.  She eventually became president of the Iowa State Sanitary Commission, organizing aid for the state's soldiers.  Other main characters in his story include Cyrus Carpenter, a Civil War officer and politician, and Private Charles Musser, who left an important diary of his wartime experiences.  Musser's letters are collected in the book <i>Soldier Boy</i>, an important first-hand account of the war by an Iowan.</p>	<p>Initial chapters place Iowa in its economic and political context before the war and introduce main characters.  Debates over secession, recruitment, and local politics are also covered.  Baker adroitly reviews the contribution of Iowa troops to the war effort.  Iowa regiments assisted in occupying Missouri, helped win crucial battles such as Shiloh and Vicksburg and also made up a significant part of Sherman's army in 1864 and 1865.</p>	<p>Iowans helped the Union pacify and eventually control Missouri, battling guerillas and working as military police.  Soldiers found little military glory but much hardship in counter-insurgency operations.  Iowa troops played important roles in the battle of Shiloh in the spring of 1862, as well as at Fort Donelson and at the Battle of Pea Ridge in Arkansas.  At Shiloh, 2,400 Iowans became casualties.  Annie Wittenmyer, who happened to be on a hospital boat, cared for many of the wounded at Shiloh.  In Iowa, Alexander Clark worked to raise a regiment of African-American soldiers.</p> 	<p>Iowa soldiers fought across the South.  In 1863, Iowa troops helped Grant win the Vicksburg campaign.  Iowa units included Charles Musser, who wrote to his parents about the difficult environment and the carnage of battle.  Late in that year, Clark successfully recruited a regiment of black troops, full of Iowans and escaped slaves from Missouri.  The 60th U.S. Colored Troops was deployed to Arkansas in 1864.  Their sacrifice helped later convince Iowa voters to support postwar civil rights laws.  Fifteen Iowa regiments joined in Sherman's March to the Sea in 1864 and 1865, while ten more regiments fought in the abortive Red River Campaign that tried to take Shreveport, Louisiana.</p>	<p>The end of the war brought some civil rights advances for African-Americans in Iowa.  In 1868, voters removed the word ""white"" from the state constitution, allowing blacks to serve on juries.  The state's Supreme Court also invalidated school segregation.  Clark served as U.S. ambassador to Liberia, while Annie Wittenmyer became President of the Women's Christian Temperance Union.  Charles Musser lived until 1934.  After Reconstruction, white racism in the state helped roll back civil rights victories and many schools were segregated.</p>  	<p>This clearly written and well-researched book is an important contribution to Iowa history and to the literature of the Civil War.  Historians of the conflict, as well as anyone interested in the history of the state, or the war in the Trans-Mississippi West, will find it worth owning.</p> <p><i>Jeff Bremer is author of </i>A Store Almost in Sight: The Economic Transformation of Missouri from the Louisiana Purchase to the Civil War<i>.

6521	9780820349466	$49.95	Driven from Home: North Carolina's Civil War Refugee Crisis		Silkenat, David			"Commonalities Considered: North Carolina's Civil War Refugee Crisis	<p><i>Driven from Home</i> is a study of the lives of the thousands of North Carolinians, white and black, who became refugees during the Civil War by David Silkenat, a social and cultural historian of the South who is currently a lecturer at the University of Edinburgh. In defining refugees, Silkenat encompasses all individuals, regardless of class or color, who are removed by the war from where they had been living. This book is an example of how our understanding of the past continues to change when scholars bring different questions to their topics. Silkenat makes clear that his work has inspiration and insights that come from his knowledge of the refugee crises that exist in the early 21st Century. This perspective does not mean that he imposes modern viewpoints on these individuals but rather skillfully asks questions of the historical documents that individuals unfamiliar with the problems of refugees would never ask. In addition to the usual topics associated with wartime dislocation, he also considers the psychological impact of this traumatic event.</p> 	<p>Silkenat recognizes the contribution to the literature on Southern refugees by Mary Elizabeth Massey's <i>Refugee Life in the Confederacy</i> but points out that her original determination to examine the broader refugee phenomenon was deterred by advisors. As a result, her <i>Refugee Life</i> focused on the experiences of elite Confederates who moved to safety behind Confederate lines. Silkenat seeks to examine refugees in the broader perspective denied Masse, considering poor whites and blacks in addition to the well-to-do. He considers five types of refugees, with chapters devoted to each.</p>	<p>The first and second chapters examine the plight of whites and blacks who escape behind Union lines in eastern North Carolina. He concludes that these individuals may have suffered the greatest privation. Union forces never fully responded to the flood of refugees, placing them in camps where they suffered from inadequate housing and food shortages that brought many of them close to starvation. In addition, these two groups faced considerable psychological trauma created by their uncertain status. Blacks faced the uncertainty of what exactly freedom meant, with government policies in constant transition, with Edward Staley, the military governor of the state, actually closing their schools and returning escaped slaves to their masters. White refugees lived in a world where their basic loyalty was constantly questioned. Black and white refugees both had to deal with military and civil authorities who viewed them from within perceptual frameworks and attempted to impose their own priorities on them.</p>	<p>Silkenat's third and fourth chapters focus on blacks and whites who moved to the state's Piedmont region in order to keep behind Confederate lines. Again, both groups faced the hardships of inadequate housing and supplies, but their problems were never as dire as those for the Union refugees. The rapidly increasing population of the region, however, created an economic crisis with rapid inflation of prices and shortage of everything from food to clothing. Problems were increased for white women whose husbands were in the Confederate Army because of North Carolina's program of relief. North Carolina law distributed relief funds based on the prewar population, failing to take into account the shifting population and thus providing inadequate funds to the communities where the greatest growth occurred. As to the slaves, Silkenat sees the refugee experience as weakening owners' authority over their slaves in communities that often were anti-Confederate and antislavery. Many slave owners found maintaining their slaves to be beyond their resources and began leasing their slaves to solve their problems. Others were forced to breakup their slave holdings, sometimes leaving behind those they considered least productive while bringing those they considered useful with them. Such upheaval ultimately broke down the masters' control over their slaves and Silkenat cites a growing amount of slave violence and an increasing number of runaways as evidence of an emboldened slave community resisting enslavement.</p> 	<p>The fifth chapter considers the lives of girls sent to boarding schools. Silkenat sees these students as refugees in the sense that they were not living in their homes during the war. These girls generally did not experience the hardships that other refugees encountered although they found food more difficult to obtain at times and they also had problems finding clothing. Some schools actually advertised themselves as havens from the war and North Carolina's female academies saw an increase in enrollment through the war years and remained financially viable. The students lived, however, in relative isolation and that condition worked to increase their anxiety. Homesickness was exacerbated. Without accurate news, rampant rumor and conjecture increased their anxiety. Silkenat sees the pervasiveness of Spiritualism among many girls as an indication of their disquiet. In the long term, the war may have had its greatest influence on these students. They found that the very purpose of education changed for many of them. With large numbers of men, who had dominated teaching prior to the war, in the army an emphasis was placed on preparing women to teach. The opening of a teachers department at Concord Female College in Salem is seen as reflective of this change. Silkenat believes that many of these students came to see teaching not only as a symbol of status but as a means of financial advancement and they went into teaching in record numbers. He finds that the Civil War marked a watershed in the demographics of teaching in North Carolina, shifting from a field where the majority of teachers were male to one where females were the majority. Also, spared from the real horrors of war many of these school girls would take the lead in remembering the war in a celebratory way. Silkenat refers to them as the architects of the Lost Cause.</p>	<p>A final chapter addresses the problems of those refugees who moved beyond the Piedmont into the North Carolina mountains. Much of his evidence for this chapter focuses on the refugee community in the vicinity of Flat Rock, near Mount Airy and Hendersonville in the far southwest part of the state. These refugees, fewer in number overall, did not face the same threats of overcrowding, famine, or disease suffered by their fellow refugees in eastern North Carolina or the Piedmont. They did find the local population inhospitable though. Those who brought in large numbers of slaves learned that the mountain people did not want them among them and especially their slaves. These refugees often faced threats and at times found themselves the targets of bands of deserters that gathered in the mountains. Their chances of being murdered increased in these far western havens.</p> 	<p>Silkenat ultimately concludes that generalizing from the diverse experiences of the refugees is difficult and that the experience of each individual was unique. Still, he sees several overall themes present. The refugee situation was a humanitarian crisis created for all of them, even though the impact varied, by all of the forces produced by the dislocation of a sizeable population. They all confronted challenges of inadequate housing, insufficient food, social destabilization, and consequent psychological upheaval. In addition, he contends that the displacement of so many people broke down the boundaries between the home front and the military front, destroying what he calls the human geography of the Old South. Civilians could no longer isolate themselves from the impact of the war.</p> 	<p>Silkenat's conclusions would benefit from some effort at making a quantitative assessment of the extent of the refugee problem. It is unclear how many individuals or families within each group actually leave home. He relies, however, on qualitative evidence that makes that impossible. That evidence also restricts his conclusions in the same manner as Massey's study. The well-to-do refugees, largely those who sought to remain behind Confederate lines, left vast amounts of evidence concerning their plight and their feelings about it. Blacks and poor whites left no such firsthand accounts, leaving conclusions to be drawn from what others wrote about them or speculation as to the meaning of their behavior. None of this takes away from what Silkenat has done in here. It simply reflects a methodological problem that is virtually impossible for the social historian to get around. Indeed, Silkenat has written what may probably be as exhaustive a study of the refugee problem in North Carolina as can be written. Scholars and the general public interested in that state and in the Civil War will find it interesting, informative, and challenging in its interpretation.</p><p><i>Carl Moneyhon is a professor at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock currently working on an interpretive history of the Civil War in Texas.

6454	9781625110404	$25.00	A Southern Community in Crisis: Harrison County, Texas, 1850-1880		Campbell, Randolph B.			"Continuity Over Change        <p>Randolph B. ""Mike"" Campbell's study of Harrison County, Texas between 1850 and 1880 is an important work on Texas and the South during the Civil War and Reconstruction period, as well as a model for historians interested in social history methodology. Originally published in 1983, <i>A Southern Community in Crisis</i> was Campbell's second book, and much of the research presented in it prefigures his later work on slavery and Reconstruction in Texas. This body of work has made Campbell one of the deans of Texas history, and he currently serves as the Chief Historian of the Texas State Historical Association. Fittingly, the Texas State Historical Association has now reissued Campbell's monograph in an affordable paperback version, with a foreword by rising Texas historian Andrew J. Torget and a new author's preface.</p>        <p>The book's structure will be familiar to readers who are versed in historical community studies. The first chapter delineates the economic, social, demographic, religious, and political structure of Harrison County, Texas in 1850. The book then proceeds to chart these aspects of life in the county through the tumultuous years of secession, the Civil War, Reconstruction, and conservative Redemption. In the final chapter, Campbell profiles Harrison County in 1880 and identifies aspects of change and continuity over the preceding three decades.</p>        <p>As Andrew Torget notes in his foreword, the sources and methodologies employed in <i>A Southern Community in Crisis</i> are representative of the social history that was being produced beginning in the 1960s and 1970s. Campbell's analysis benefits from the fact that ""virtually every historical source traditionally employed in narrative and descriptive accounts is available for Harrison County"" (9). For scholars who are interested in quantitative and demographic methods, Campbell's work is exemplary. Twenty-eight tables display information derived from United States census data and from local tax, property, and probate records. Two appendices explain the usage of census information in the text. Rather than providing a dry account of land prices, voting patterns, and other data, Campbell produces a very readable narrative that draws upon a variety of manuscript and newspaper sources to give life to his subjects.</p>         <p>In utilizing the wealth of data that is available on Harrison County during the nineteenth century, Campbell contends with two major historical questions. The first concerns the relative preeminence of continuity or change as a characteristic of the American South during the Civil War era. Quantitative data on Harrison County's socioeconomic structure allows Campbell to argue, for instance, that although ""emancipation meant a tremendous loss of property"" (387) for planters, and that in the post-emancipation period ""planters were being joined to some extent by merchants and townspeople in the wealth holding elite"" (387), Harrison County planters actually increased their share of the community's wealth between 1860 and 1880 (389). Other measures of economic and social change outlined in the book also support Campbell's overarching contention that in Harrison County, continuity outweighed change during this period, at least in terms of the structure of wealth and power in the community. The end of slavery was the one major structural change in Harrison County during this period, but black political power was circumscribed after Harrison County's local version of ""redemption"" in 1878, several years earlier than a number of other Texas counties with large or majority-black populations.</p>         <p>The second major controversy that Campbell enters into is the question of Texas identity. Beginning with his opening salvo via <i>A Southern Community in Crisis</i>, Campbell has been a leading voice for the argument that Texas has been an essentially Southern state for most of its history, and may still be categorized as such today. Although scholars outside of the Lone Star State may be unaware of the controversy, Texas historians and cultural commentators waged something of a civil war for much of the twentieth century over the vexing question of whether Texas is Southern, Western, or something else entirely. The controversy continues today, although Campbell's interpretation seems to have gained the upper hand in academic circles in the early twenty-first century. In focusing on cotton-growing Harrison County, which is located on the Louisiana border in Northeast Texas and hosted the largest enslaved population of any Texas county in 1860, Campbell points toward his contention that the most heavily populated regions of Texas in the nineteenth century were without question part of the larger American South.</p>         <p>Because Harrison County was (and still is) a place that should be considered Southern in its identity, Campbell is able to offer an important work on a locality that has broader implications outside the boundaries of both Harrison County and Texas. In the new preface, Campbell acknowledges that the concept of a ""community,"" as he describes Harrison County, is troubled by lines of conflict along the boundaries of race, class, and gender, an idea that perhaps could have been explored in more depth in the book. Nonetheless, this seems to be a relatively minor quibble for a thorough and useful book that effectively contributes answers to the questions with which Campbell is concerned. Readers will likely derive the most insight from <i>A Southern Community in Crisis</i> by reading it in conjunction with similar local histories, such as Steven Hahn's <i>The Roots of Southern Populism</i>, which also appeared in 1983. By comparison with a place like the Georgia Upcountry over the same time period, Harrison County indeed seems to have experienced little structural change, a difference with wider implications for our understanding of the cotton-belt South in the late nineteenth century. Readers should also consult Walter L. Buenger's <i>The Path to a Modern South</i> (2001), which examines Northeast Texas between the 1880s and 1930. Picking up chronologically where Campbell left off, Buenger finds that the counties located just to the north of Harrison experienced a great deal of social and economic change beginning in the 1880s, a trend that marked a divergence from the rest of the South. Thirty-four years after its publication, <i>A Southern Community in Crisis</i> remains essential reading for students of Texas, the South, the Civil War era, and social history.</p>      <p><i>Nicholas Roland is a doctoral candidate in United States history at the University of Texas at Austin.

"Creating Political Parties in New Mexico<p>Most historians do not pay much attention to New Mexico during the U.S. Civil War. There are exceptions, of course. Donald S. Frazier's <i>Blood and Treasure: Confederate Empire in the Southwest</i> (1995) analyzes rebel general Henry H. Sibley's invasion of New Mexico and his quest to capture the territory, and its mineral resources, in an attempt to carve out a rebel empire in the Southwestern United States. Jerry D. Thompson's <i>A Civil War History of the New Mexico Volunteers and Militia</i> reminds readers that New Mexicans fought in the war, and illuminates some of their motivations. Other historians have written about the battles of Valverde and Glorieta Pass. However, New Mexico tends to be overlooked or minimized in the scholarly literature. This is likely because the Trans-Mississippi theater is the least studied of the three theaters of the U.S. Civil War (Eastern, Western, and Trans-Mississippi). For years, historians overlooked this theater or derided it as the junkyard of the Confederate army. Recent scholarship has begun to rectify this neglect and to consider the Trans-Mississippi more carefully. However, New Mexico remains an enigma. What, for instance, did the people of New Mexico, both Euroamericans and Nuevomexicanos (New Mexicans), think about the U.S. Civil War? For that matter, how did they feel about the U.S? What did political incorporation look like in New Mexico? Did the territory have a functioning two-party system? </p><p>Thankfully, historical sociologist Phillip B. Gonzales has written a very large book offering answers to these questions. Currently Professor of Sociology at the University of New Mexico, he has published widely about New Mexican history. In <i>Política</i>, he argues that Nuevomexicanos were very involved in territorial politics. As he observes, ""the United States conquered Nuevomexicanos through military coercion, but the latter realized substantial participation in the American polity from the start"" (3). In other words, Nuevomexicanos were not passive actors who had little to no agency. Rather, they became involved in politics very quickly and played an integral role in the political life of the territory. </p><p>Gonzales divides the book into five parts. The first covers the period before the annexation of New Mexico by the United States. Here the author includes useful background for readers who are not familiar with the history of New Mexico. He describes life and society in New Mexico and highlights the three groups that controlled New Mexico's government: the rich (hombres de bien), military and militia officers, and the Catholic Church. Although many people have images of vicious fights between newcomers and natives, this image does not capture the entirety of the situation. Cooperation, as well as conflict, characterized relations between the two groups. Once the U.S. Army arrived, during the U.S. War with Mexico, Stephen Watts Kearny did his best to co-opt Nuevomexicanos. Some New Mexicans found they had much in common with Kearny, but others resisted the lure of the occupier. Therefore, mistrust of U.S. rule, combined with accommodationism, fueled a politics of factionalism. </p><p>In the period between annexation (1848) and the beginning of the U.S. Civil War (1861), elections for a delegate to Congress and the territorial legislature ""generated a relatively constant attention to politics among Nuevomexicanos"" and ""encouraged territory-wide political networks"" (184). Nuevomexicanos were vital players in elections and the political life of the territory. In addition, many of them sought and won political offices. Gonzales disagrees with the notion that, for the first three decades after annexation, New Mexico had no political parties, only disorganized factions. Rather, he contends, New Mexicans quickly developed an American Party (not at all related to the Know-Nothing Party) and a Mexican Party. The designations ""American"" and ""Mexican"" should be utilized with some caution because both parties had Euroamerican and Nuevomexicano members. In other words, after annexation, Nuevomexicanos quickly joined Euroamericans to create political parties. These party labels were not static. In a few short years, the Mexican Party took a new name: the Democratic Party. The American Party, on the other hand, became the People's Independent Party (290). </p><p>At the beginning of the U.S. Civil War, Republican operators went to New Mexico and began the process of creating a Republican Party. As in other regions of the U.S., nonpartisanship and unity characterized the initial months of the war. This unity quickly fell apart and Nuevomexicanos began to use the label ""Copperhead"" and charge political enemies with draft resistance. Political foes of the delegate elected in 1863, José Francisco Perea, grumbled that he owed his election to the Copperheads and that he held Copperhead sentiments. In a fascinating chapter, Gonzales explores the 1865 delegate election between Perea and his cousin José Francisco Chávez. Chávez became involved with politics because of the furor over General James H. Carleton's proposed Indian reservation at Bosque Redondo. This issue ""drove New Mexico's binary cleavage to Grand Canyon depth"" (431) because many Nuevomexicanos despised Native Americans as bloodthirsty raiders. This is a particularly interesting discussion because historians have begun to pay more attention to the story of Native Americans during the Civil War and Reconstruction. </p><p>Parts Four and Five analyze politics during Reconstruction. Chávez defeated his cousin Perea in the delegate election of 1865. During the election of 1867, however, Chávez faced Charles Clever in a grueling contest. Gonzales devotes a great deal of attention, perhaps at times a bit too much, to this election. For instance, he spends a rather long chapter exploring the anti-Semitic language of some of Chávez's supporters. While interesting and revelatory, the material could easily have been compressed. Clever won the election, likely through fraud, and Chávez contested his election. Chávez eventually won the seat, but the time it took to render a verdict is instructive. The Republican-dominated House of Representatives had two claimants, both of whom claimed to sympathize with Republicans. Republican and Democrat parties, although in the midst of forming, had yet not fully coalesced. However, by the late 1860s, the New Mexico Republican Party solidified and dominated the election of 1869. Democrats, despite some shakiness, were not far behind. During the election of 1871, José Manuel Gallegos defeated Chávez. Thus, despite Republican strength during 1869, the resurgence of the Democrats meant both parties were established players in territorial politics by 1871. </p><p>There are two critiques worth exploring. The first concerns the chronological period of this study. The subtitle of the volume suggests that the book covers the period 1821 - 1910. In actuality, Política ends in 1871. The election of Gallegos, the author contends, ""inaugurated a new political era for New Mexico"" (785). To be sure, Gonzales discusses 1871 - 1910. However, he does so in a few dozen pages in the conclusion and the result feels rushed and cursory. The central issue here is that, in these few pages, he describes the erosion of Nuevomexicano political power. Given the limited space, his explanation of why this occurred is rather brief. Given the subject matter of this book, and his attention to Nuevomexicanos as political actors, this decision makes the ending feel discordant. One wishes he would have included a sixth part and probed this erosion of power. On the other hand, perhaps he will consider this topic in another volume. </p><p>The second critique concerns the material. Some scholars do not include many people in their books, preferring to focus instead on big forces and ideas. This is not a critique one can level at Política. This book is teeming with people, many of whom will be unknown to readers. Gonzales, therefore, should be lauded for featuring the voices of so many people in this volume and for making sure to include both Euroamerican and Nuevomexicano voices. On the other hand, at times one cannot but feel as if there were too many people, too many voices, and too many details. The coverage of New Mexican politics is exhaustive. However, that can be both good and bad. Political historians will appreciate this volume, but other scholars, not to mention a non-academic audience, might get lost in the thicket of details and not be able to see the big picture. In addition, the book does contain some errors, ranging from incorrect names and dates, to problems of interpretation. </p><p>The critiques raised by this review do not diminish the importance of this volume. Gonzales has produced a comprehensive discussion of politics in New Mexico and the linkages between territorial and national politics. This book will appeal to anyone interested in New Mexico, political history, and citizenship. It also demonstrates how rich this topic is and how much additional research could be conducted on politics and political incorporation in New Mexico during this turbulent period. </p><p><i>Evan C.

Mackowski, Christopher		"Destiny's Conditions: Joseph Hooker's Long Winter with the Army of the Potomac<p>The Civil War must occupy the top rank as the least forgotten conflict in the American experience with warfare. Nevertheless, despite many thousands of books and articles on the American Civil War, there are aspects of that conflict that remain unfamiliar to many readers more than one hundred fifty years later. Albert Z. Conner and Chris Mackowski explore one of these episodes in their history of the Army of the Potomac during a largely overlooked three-month period from January 26 to the end of April 1863. </p><p>In <i>Seizing Destiny: The Army of the Potomac's ""Valley Forge"" and the Civil War Winter that Saved the Union</i>, the authors examine the revival of the Army of the Potomac under Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker's command after its defeat at Fredericksburg and the infamous Mud March under Maj. Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside. Depression, desertion, and disease affected an Army that had been beaten down physically and mentally when it moved into winter quarters on the north bank of the Rappahannock. When Burnside offered to resign following these two disasters, Lincoln replaced him with his insubordinate subordinate, Hooker, who had commanded the Center Grand Division at Fredericksburg. </p><p>The relationship between Abraham Lincoln and Joe Hooker began with probably the most singular letter of appointment ever issued by a political leader to the general in command of the war's most important theater. Lincoln wrote, ""General: I have placed you at the head of the Army of the Potomac. Of course I have done this upon what appears to me to be sufficient reasons, and I think it best for you to know that there are some things in regard to which I am not quite satisfied with you."" </p> <p>Lincoln tells Hooker that his behavior toward General Ambrose Burnside, his predecessor, was ""a great wrong to the country and to a most meritorious and honorable brother officer."" He then informs Hooker that ""I have heard ... of your recently saying that both the Army and the Government needed a dictator. Of course, it was not for this, but in spite of it, that I have given you the Command."" Then he bluntly challenges Hooker: ""Only those generals who gain successes can set up dictators. What I now ask of you is military success, and I will risk the dictatorship"" (49-50). </p><p>After his appointment Hooker said, ""...I trembled at the task before me, in entering upon so important a command"" (51). And well he might. As <i>Seizing Destiny</i> illustrates, Hooker's tenure as commander began with the Army racked by exhaustion, desertions, illness, harsh weather, and slumping morale. Over the next few months, Hooker worked to achieve the success Lincoln demanded by returning to military fundamentals to regenerate the morale and fighting power of the Army of the Potomac. Conner and Mackowski tell the story of that renewal. </p> <p><i>Seizing Destiny</i> is the result of research that takes advantage of many hundreds of primary manuscript sources located at the Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park. As the bibliography notes, over 500 volumes exist in the Park's Bound Volume Collection. They, in addition to several other important private collections, provide the material for <i>Seizing Destiny</i>. The official military and naval records collected and printed by the Government Printing Office in the late nineteenth century also are referenced throughout along with many contemporary newspapers and periodicals, diaries and correspondence collections, and numerous regimental histories. The words of soldiers of all ranks supplemented by a broad sampling of other material create an interesting depiction of an army undergoing a complex process of recovery, renewal, and preparation. </p><p>The basic argument of <i>Seizing Destiny</i> turns on two concepts, the strategic pause and the non-battle turning point. Saratoga, Buena Vista, Midway, Inchon, and Tet are battles that historians have identified as turning points in American military history. Gettysburg and Vicksburg are considered turning points in the Civil War. Less attention-grabbing are the measures taken (or that ought to have been taken) in the weeks and months before those battles to create the conditions for victory (or defeat). That is the purview of <i>Seizing Destiny</i>. Indispensable to the realization of this non-battle turning point is what the authors call a ""strategic pause."" </p><p>The authors write that the strategic pause is ""regrettably (but revealingly) missing from U.S. military historical terminology,"" but it is doubtful that experienced regular Army officers were unfamiliar with the need occasionally to suspend operations to rest and regroup (xii). Even successful armies must halt and reorganize from time to time to allow supporting units and supply trains to catch up. Moreover, in January 1863 as the Mud March makes clear, the weather dictated a pause in military operations as much as any deliberate plan by Union leadership to refrain from battle. </p><p>As for the use of the label ""strategic"" in relation to this pause, the term ""operational pause"" is more accurate. Suggesting that the national war effort -- i.e., the strategic level of war -- was suspended just because one Federal army was stuck in the Virginia mud is inaccurate and overlooks activities in other theaters. Still, there's no arguing over the fact that the eastern front was seen as the most important theater, and it was there that Hooker went to work.<sup> </sup> Styled ""Fighting Joe"" as the result of a chance headline, Hooker set his organizational and leadership skills to work rebuilding the worn out Army of the Potomac for a new spring campaign while continuing to fight minor engagements around the Army's northern Virginia winter quarters (97, 199). </p><p>Hooker is given credit by the authors for the reformation of the Army. They specifically point out that the Army's turnaround could not have occurred before Hooker's tenure and that there wasn't time after his removal from command for Gen. George Meade to put his stamp on the Army before Gettysburg.(x-xi) However, it is worth noting that many of the problems encountered by Hooker echoed the chaos of the early days faced by Gen. George McClellan when he transformed the Army after First Bull Run. Then, everything -- manned defenses, proper encampments, troop training, extended enlistments, and even regular discipline to keep the men in camp -- was lacking. Little Mac advanced the work on these formative problems even if he proved not to be the field commander needed to lead the Army successfully in battle. Hooker by contrast did not have to deal with such utterly raw conditions; he could build on some of foundations laid by the earlier commanders and on the recent battlefield experiences of the soldiers in the ranks, who by January 1863 were well on their way to becoming true veterans. </p><p>Hooker proved to be an able administrator. Operating on the principle that a commander gets what he inspects and not what he expects, Hooker added an inspector-general to his staff (183). His administrative reforms corrected problems of supply and transportation and provided the Union soldiers with fresher food, new clothing, improved medical care, and better discipline. Private George Wolcott wrote home to tell his family that ""I am still in enjoyment of excellent health and would you believe it, weight 167 lbs. -- 19 lbs. more than ever before in my life"" (168). Hooker also reformed the leave system, a necessary corrective that kept soldiers from wandering away from the camps without authority while permitting those men with valid reasons to take time away from camp. He made way for the promotion of officers of proven merit and fired incompetent officers as a 7th Wisconsin captain reported in a letter. ""Gen. Hooker is weeding it out, almost every day there are a number of officers dismissed the service ... hurrah for Old Joe as the boys call him"" (109, 168, 291-292). Hooker enhanced training, and as the authors noted, by mid-February ""Discipline and training were accepted in a businesslike manner by the soldiers and junior officers"" (141). As a result of all this work, desertions declined, morale increased, and the Army's self-confidence grew. </p><p>Hooker also undertook other changes to what is now called the Table of Organization and Equipment (T/O&E), some more successful than others. He reorganized the Army's cavalry into a cavalry corps, which soon proved its value against the Confederate units that had previously tormented Union forces (90), and created a military intelligence bureau under Colonel George H. Sharpe to replace the informal organization that had existed previously (100). He also made changes to the Army's artillery organization that made it less effective during the coming battle at Chancellorsville (90). </p><p>It takes more than a dozen weeks, or even a dozen months, to make an effective army. In Northern Virginia in early 1863 there was time enough, however, for Hooker -- whose modifications and improvements of the Army were informed by recent experience -- to build on the work of those who had gone before. These housekeeping, administrative, and logistical tasks are not sexy. Nearly all readers and too many historians prefer the grand sweep of battle and the political intrigues that exist behind the lines. Fans of drum-and-trumpet history regularly fail to appreciate the long support and experience tail that extends behind the spear point of a successful modern army. The Romans knew the importance of this work. ""They do not wait for the war to begin before handling their arms,"" as Josephus wrote in <i>The Jewish War</i>, and ""It would not be far from the truth to call their drills bloodless battles, their battles bloody drills.""<sup> </sup> Training, supply, sound organization, and competent administration are crucial if not necessarily sufficient for victory. </p><p>That this was so was proven when Hooker put the Army on the road in late April 1863. Gen. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia remained in position around Fredericksburg, and Hooker, now commanding a rested and ready Army, set out to destroy Lee's force, saying ""May God have mercy on General Lee, for I will have none"" (230). For various reasons, Hooker's offensive failed despite the reorganization of the Army. It may seem like a peculiar sort of turning point that the Army Hooker had rebuilt immediately failed its first test at Chancellorsville, but Conner and Mackowski argue that the key conclusion to be drawn from this period is that the Army did not break or falter as it had done after Fredericksburg (268-269). Nevertheless, Lincoln fired Hooker on June 28, 1863, replacing him with Maj. Gen. George G. Meade just prior to the battle of Gettysburg. Hooker, like McClellan before him, left a legacy of an incrementally more professional, more honed military tool than the one he found. If he proved not to be the man to wield it, he helped form the edge until that man arrived. </p><p>It is a belief firmly held by military professionals that the study of military history is a fundamental part of understanding and preparing for war. The story of Hooker's reforms as told in <i>Seizing Destiny </i> by Albert Z. Conner, Jr., who passed away in May 2016, and Chris Mackowski will be another source soldiers should study. </p><p><i>Larry Grant is an adjunct professor of history at the Citadel. </i></p><p>_______________________</p><p><sup>1</sup> As James M.

6398	9780195187236	$34.95	The Rivers Ran Backward: The Civil War and the Remaking of the American Middle Border		Phillips, Christopher			"Dividing the West<p>The American West once flanked both sides of the Ohio River and the upper Mississippi.  Its peoples shared a regional identity and they intermingled freely.  Abraham Lincoln and Mary Todd, both born in Kentucky, met and married in Illinois.  Joshua Speed, a Kentuckian who lived for a time in Illinois, became Lincoln's best friend.  These three and many more regarded Kentucky's Henry Clay, ""Harry of the West,"" as the greatest political leader of the era.</p><p>But the antebellum West was torn apart by the Civil War.  <i>The Rivers Ran Backward</i> explains how the ""middle border region"" fractured (12).  Focused on the two border slave states, Kentucky and Missouri, and on the central and southern regions of the ""Old Northwest"" -- Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois -- this splendidly-researched book demonstrates that any common Western identity was lost amid enormous wartime convulsions.</p>   <p>Kentucky's and Missouri's whites found themselves ground between contending armies once the fighting started.  Majorities initially supported a war to restore the Union and many volunteered accordingly.  But ""military occupation"" upended the lives of the loyal and the disloyal alike.  A ""war within the war"" created insecurity for all.  The Union army increasingly used ""hard-line tactics"" against suspected rebels, while ""merciless guerrillas"" retaliated in kind against white Unionists, free blacks, and slaves (155, 167-70).  The book's cover reproduces ""Order No. 11,"" artist George Caleb Bingham's grim portrayal of Union troops marauding among Missouri civilians.</p><p>When the war for Union became a war for freedom, it pulled the rug out from under pro-slavery Unionists.  In Kentucky especially, emancipation ""strengthened a struggling southern nationalism, previously stunted by reflexive unionism and Confederate invasions"" (212).  Black enlistments in the Union army triggered ""white retributive anger"" and ""overt racial warfare"" (294, 296).  Kentucky, quipped historian Merton Coulter, ""waited until after the war to secede from the Union"" (331).  In the early twentieth century the ""commemorative power of the middle border's Lost Cause"" produced a prodigious 350-foot-tall obelisk in the Kentucky town where Jefferson Davis was born (315).</p><p>Phillips' expert command of Kentucky and Missouri history enables him to analyze incisively the war's impact in the Lower North.  He shows that many early white settlers in Indiana and Illinois had no quarrel whatsoever with racial bondage.  Most notably, the repulsive John Crenshaw of Shawneetown, Illinois, used enslaved labor to manufacture salt between the 1820s and the 1840s.  Accordingly, Phillips pushes back against the self-sanctifying postwar stereotype ""embraced by residents of the modern Midwest,"" who depict their region as always having been antislavery.  Instead, white residents of the Lower North saw slavery as ""a negotiable issue in American politics and society"" (35-36). </p><p>This book shows that many volunteers for the Union army from Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois broadly shared the perspective of their counterparts from Kentucky and Missouri -- they wanted to restore the Union, not disrupt slavery.  A pronounced ""backlash"" against emancipation was especially notable among soldiers from southern Illinois.  They ""found themselves caught between competing nationalist fires.""  Their ""western nationalism"" could not be reconciled with one that ""equated opposition to emancipation with disloyalty"" (230-31).  But in the end they were unable to resist forces that were transforming the West into a North and a South.</p><p>Phillips is careful not to conflate estrangement from the Union cause in the Lower North with far more overt pro-Confederate tendencies in the Union slave states.  Butternuts and Copperheads in Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois disdained overbearing Yankee meddling and rejected heavy-handed Republican Party efforts to insist upon emancipation as a key concomitant of the Union war effort.  But far more tangible economic and social costs infuriated border state slaveholders.  They blamed Yankees for taking their slaves away, and in so doing they became ardent Southerners.</p>  <p>Phillips relies primarily on a mountain of primary-source research and ventures only cautiously into disputed historiographical terrain.  But his familiarity with the Lower North leaves him unable to accept James Oakes' idea that the Republican Party favored emancipation ""before and during the early years of the war"" (363n47).  Phillips distances himself from Chandra Manning, who emphasizes the growth of emancipation sentiment in the Union army (396n52).  Unlike Jennifer Weber and others who share her views, Phillips leans toward Frank Klement's conclusion that the Copperhead threat was ""exaggerated by opportunistic Republicans"" (411n59).</p><p>Phillips writes most persuasively about Kentucky and Missouri, the two border slave states of the Old Southwest.  His coverage of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois -- the three adjoining states of the Old Northwest -- emphasizes their pre-war affinities with Kentucky and Missouri.  He tends to downplay the cultural and economic forces that were propelling the three northwestern states away from their slave state neighbors long before the war began.  Yankees from New England and upstate New York always dominated the so-called Western Reserve of northeastern Ohio; by the 1840s and 1850s Yankees also were flooding into northern Illinois.  Their presence unsettled existing political arrangements and prefigured the rise of the Republican Party.</p><p>Nobody would disagree with Phillips' view that partisan allegiances along the middle border did broadly pit Whigs, who wanted ""an active and even interventionist government to promote economic development,"" against Democrats, ""who regarded an invasive governmental presence at best with suspicion and at worst with outright hostility"" (59).  But Free Soil politics in the Old Northwest during the 1840s and 1850s appealed to Yankees from both the existing parties.  Talented political entrepreneurs -- most notably Abraham Lincoln -- recognized the potential for a new political grouping that would bring those with qualms about the South or slavery together with those who wanted to expand mechanized commercial agriculture and build a modern transportation network.</p><p>This is not to say that the Republican Party of the 1850s posed any kind of direct threat to the slave system.  Phillips notes that pioneering Republicans depicted their party as western rather than sectional.  But most whites in Kentucky and Missouri viewed Republicans as bitter antagonists rather than as fellow westerners.  Partisan ties that once stretched across the middle border were sundered.  The sectional split apparent during the 1850s then became a chasm during wartime.</p>   <p>Anne Marshall, Aaron Astor, William C. Harris, and Matthew Salafia each have offered recent books on the painful history of the border region before, during, and after the war.  Christopher Phillips, already established as a leading member of this significant subfield, has now produced its most important and wide-reaching title to date.  The <i>Rivers Ran Backward</i> deftly uses the lens of regional identity to make visible a transformation that has long been blurred or obscured.</p> <p><i> Daniel W.

And they also managed, for the most part, to avoid looking hard at the huge and long-lived Atlantic Slave Trade.  But with the modern Civil Rights Movement all that began to change.  One of its largest (and least acknowledged) triumphs involved demanding access not only to lunch counters, voting booths, jury boxes, and integrated public schools, but also to the long and inspirational black past.  Before the 1960s, white citizens had largely denied or ignored the existence of African American history; only a scattering of intrepid pioneers, black and white, had pursued this hidden heritage with seriousness, depth, and integrity.</p>   <p>Since then, several generations of well-trained scholars, using new and old historical tools, have been rebuilding a more honest and inclusive national past.  Unfortunately, despite the election of a two-term black president and the completion of the National Museum of African American History and Culture, much of this collective re-examination has remained inside the academic bubble.  Among historians, both slavery and the slave trade have come in for decades of increasing scrutiny and debate, and scholars are slowly knitting back together these two distinctive areas of research.  A new book by Sharla M. Fett, for example, reminds us again that, despite prohibitions, the profitable forced deportation of Africans to North America continued right up to the Civil War.  In <i>Recaptured Africans: Surviving Slave Ships, Detention, and Dislocation in the Final Years of the Slave Trade</i> (2017), Fett quotes a speech by Frederick Douglass in 1858.  He cautioned listeners that slavery and Atlantic slave trafficking remained deeply intertwined "" -- and the one is as hateful as the other.  They are twin monsters,"" the abolitionist thundered, ""both hatched in the same polluted nest.""</p>   	<p>The great American painter Winslow Homer gestured toward these twin monsters in his 1899 masterpiece, <i>The Gulf Stream</i>, though white critics overlooked his subtle suggestion for nearly a century.  Historian Sowande' M. Mustakeem also sees this intertwining, as the title of her new book suggests.  In <i>Slavery at Sea: Terror, Sex, and Sickness in the Middle Passage</i>, she rightly bemoans the fact that historians of the peculiar institution have generally picked up the story at the American shoreline, treating the horrific crossing as an inaccessible prelude, or separate research topic, rather than as the crushing formative transition that it was.  Huge numbers never made it, while the innocent survivors entered lifetimes of incarceration in the slave labor camps of the Americas.  ""One cannot make sense of""Atlantic slave societies,"" Mustakeem argues, without acknowledging that the ""deep psychological scars""of the Middle Passage"" worked to transform ""bondpeople's lives as well as the societies and communities into which they were imported."" (7)</p><p>Mustakeem follows in the wake of slave trade scholars Stephanie Smallwood and Marcus Rediker, whose important books appeared a decade ago, and she pays tribute to a long line of predecessors stretching back to W.E.B. DuBois.  She acknowledges the pioneering quantitative work of Philip Curtin and the subsequent accomplishment of David Eltis and others in creating slavevoyages.org.  (On the other hand, the four-volumes of slave trade documents compiled by the Wellesley economic historian Elizabeth Donnan in the 1930s go unmentioned in the text -- and in many recent reviews -- even though their republication by Octagon Books in 1969 offered inspiration to a whole generation of researchers.)  From the start, the author makes clear that she hopes to get beyond, and in some ways offset, primary and secondary sources that have pushed to determine the numerical scope and economic profitability of the traffic.</p><p> ""I came to explore,"" Sylvia Plath wrote in her memorable poem, <i>Diving into the Wreck</i>. Like a determined swim teacher, Mustakeem urges us to forego endless wading around the edges of this tough topic and dive into deep dark waters, seeing for ourselves, as the poet put it, ""the damage that was done.""  Beyond grim evidence about omnipresent violence, sexual abuse, and sickness, she wants us to consider the massive prevalence of death at sea that is too often discounted.  (The expression ""thrown to the sharks"" had its origins in  this dehumanizing Atlantic traffic.)  And for the saltwater survivors, she works effectively to underscore the indelible and widely varied trauma -- what historian Nell Irvin Painter has called the enormous ""psychological hurt."" (123)</p><p>For Americans of all sorts, this difficult dive is becoming more accessible, and more necessary, every day.  Not everyone will choose to tackle it in the same way.  For those drawn to fiction, <i>Sacred Hunger</i> (1992), Barry Unsworth's penetrating novel of a 1752 Liverpool slaving voyage, holds up well a quarter century later.  For others inclined to follow a single voyage in detail, Robert Harms' admirable work from a decade later unfolds the journey of an actual French slaving vessel in the 1730s.  His book, <i>The Diligent: A Voyage Through the Worlds of the Slave Trade</i> (2002), does not appear in Mustakeem's bibliography, but she makes good use of some of the jarring material from the later travels of a Rhode Island slaver, now well-documented by Sean M. Kelley in <i>The Voyage of the Slave Ship Hare: A Journey into Captivity from Sierra Leone to South Carolina</i> (2016).  Whether you elect to take the plunge with Mustakeem or some other expert diver, the damage you survey may prompt you to think differently about African American history, the so-called Age of Enlightenment, and even the American Civil War.</p>  <p><i>Peter H.

6348	9780807163108	$48.00	Marital Cruelty in Antebellum America		Sager, Robin C.			DUTY OVER LOVE: CHARGES OF CRUELTY IN ANTEBELLUM DIVORCE<p>In <i>Marital Cruelty in Antebellum America</i>, Robin C. Sager looks at over 1500 divorce cases from Virginia, Texas, and Wisconsin from 1840 to 1860 and argues that antebellum Americans understood and valued their marriages in terms of gendered duties rather than through the ideal of compassionate marriage. It has been well established by previous historians, such as Nancy Cott, Norma Basch, and Hendrik Hartog, that ideas about marriage and especially divorce were changing around midcentury. Sager takes all of these changes into account and separates the ideal of compassionate marriage from the reality of marriage for those seeking divorce on the grounds of cruelty. Sager does so by investigating not only how marital cruelty was defined by the states, but also how Americans themselves defined marital cruelty in the courtroom. </p> <p>The charges of cruelty in antebellum marriage covered a range of offenses. The first four chapters of this work each focus on a specific type of cruelty which includes: verbal cruelty, physical cruelty, sexual cruelty, and cruelty associated with drunkenness and neglect. The final chapter looks at the role and intervention of the community these cases of divorce on the grounds of cruelty. Perhaps the most significant aspect of Sager's work is her attention and analysis of divorce cases in which the wife was the one accused of cruelty. Except in what have been considered rare or exceptional cases, historians have been slow to recognize women as perpetrators of violence. In an attempt to help correct the assumption that only men were violent, Sanger highlights examples of women acting behaving cruelly toward their husbands through their speech, their fists, and in their drunken sprees. </p> <p>A main goal of Sager's work is to compare three distinct regions in order to gain insight as to whether the South's reputation for violence impacted divorces granted on charges of cruelty in any significant way. Sager chose Virginia to represent the established South, Texas to represent a southern version of a frontier region, and Wisconsin to represent a northern frontier region. In comparing both frontier regions to the established Southern state of Virginia, Sager argues that gender roles were much more unstable and therefore, were able to be challenged more directly in both frontier regions. As a result, these instances of marital cruelty in Texas and Wisconsin were very much reflections of these gender instabilities. However, the main distinction Sager finds between Texas and Wisconsin is that Texas, as a southern frontier region, was similar in many ways to Virginia, in that couples in both states viewed marital duty in terms of honor culture. As a result, Sanger finds more instances of marital cruelty in the frontier regions but makes the distinction that much of the marital cruelty in Wisconsin was aimed at couples battling for power amidst gender instability, whereas marital cruelty in Texas was understood through honor culture despite gender instabilities. Overall, Sager makes a convincing argument as to how region impacted couples' understandings of their marital responsibilities according to gender roles, however, it raises questions about one region that Sager has omitted, the northeast. Although, the addition of the northeast could potentially double the length of this work, it might help tease out more of the differences between northern frontier and southern frontier. Including the northeast might also provide a clearer distinction between antebellum Americans in the North and the South in terms of their expectations in marriage, as well as how they defined marital cruelty. </p> <p>Overall, <i>Marital Cruelty in Antebellum America</i> makes a considerable contribution to the scholarship on marriage, divorce, and domestic violence in nineteenth-century America. Most importantly, Sager's emphasis on the fact that women were also perpetrators of domestic violence and cruelty gets us one step closer to what life was really like in Antebellum America. </p><p>Lindsay A.

Among the many affecting images offered was a portrait of a young soldier, misidentified as ""Georgia private Edwin Jennison.""  Close to sixty years later, Alexandra Filipowski and Hugh T. Harrington's <i>The Boy Soldier: Edwin Jemison and the Story Behind the Most Remarkable Portrait of the Civil</i> War attempts to tell us the story of the boy in the portrait, Edwin Francis Jemison, Co I, 2nd Louisiana. Continuing the earlier work of teacher and researcher Jo-Ann Aiello, Flipowski and Harrington flesh out the life, service and death of Jemison. Through attention to the Jemison extended family, the environs of Edwin's homes and school, we learn about him and his world as it turned to war.</p> <p>As with the story of any individual soldier, the story of the regiment in which he serves offers a frame for understanding Pvt. Jemison's short military career. Using his familial nickname, Eddie, throughout, the authors try to give us a closer personal connection to the 16-year-old boy who enlisted and the 17-year-old soldier who lost his life at Malvern Hill. </p> <p>The history of the Pelican Grays- Company I - of the 2nd Louisiana Infantry is used to imagine the story of Eddie as a soldier. Held in reserve or keeping watch in fortifications, Eddie and the Pelican Grays served where and as needed. As is the case with many a Civil War regiment, the banality of daily discomfort, framed by the terror of infrequent interludes of active combat did not allow Eddie to become desensitized to the vicissitudes of war. When he and the rest of the 2nd Louisiana marched into battle at Malvern Hill, their previous experiences may have done little to prepare them for what they would face.</p><p>The researching of Eddie's death at the Battle of Malvern Hill provides us with the most interesting chapters of the book. Using newspaper articles of the period, the story of Edwin's death and burial take shape. These newspaper articles bring into question a mixture of truths, false memories, and perhaps a charlatan's molding of stories not able to be corroborated when all parties involved are long dead, which mars the researcher's ability to make any definitive statements about these accounts. Other more personal familial accounts, however, give us the bare bones on which the careful researcher must stand. In research, dead ends can be as fascinating as they are frustrating.</p><p>While every storyteller may not feel it is necessary to delve deeply into the still raw and complicated questions around the enslavement of a race, the authors sidestep the acknowledgement of the work of the enslaved in the Jemison household. It is difficult to read the sentence, ""Monroe's population in 1860 was only 364 people, not including the slave population"" (p. 21) without discomfort. The use of the word ""people"" to describe only the white population of Monroe without reporting the almost equal population of enslaved people in Monroe, Georgia seems out of place in this book and perhaps could be rethought if there are future editions printed.</p> <p>In the end, however, the book sheds light on the life of a soldier whose image many know and contemplate. Is the enigmatic look on his face prescience, in the moment captured by the photographer, revealing the solemnity and poignancy of the loss of a generation's future promise in the prosecution of a lost cause?</p><p><i>Meg Galante-DeAngelis is a Developmentalist who has served on the faculty of the University of Connecticut's Department of Human Development and Family studies for almost 25 years.

6459	9781935623915	$37.95	Astride Two Worlds: Technology and the American Civil War		Hacker, Barton C.			"Exceptional or Representative: Technology and the American Civil War<p>When lecturing about the American Civil War, one finds that the question of whether it was the 'first modern war' or the 'last Napoleonic conflict' invariably intrigues students -- who then devote perhaps too much of their research essays upon the comparatively straightforward, technological factors rather than the messier, seemingly less tangible political ones.  (Then again, analyses of raw 'weapons and tactics' continue to dominate military history no matter how much academics might complain.)  But those students who come across this book will fortunately be led into a much more sophisticated rendering of the topic, from nine authors including the editor, Dr. Barton C. Hacker, senior curator of armed forces history at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History.</p>  <p>Stemming from a 2012 conference, the following chapter-essays range from Merritt Roe Smith's take on mass-production of small arms to Steven A. Walton's survey of the big guns, from field artillery to seacoast 'monsters', which also seems to have made the most of international sources and reports, for example.  Other interesting chapters include David J. Gerleman's ""Veterinary Care in the Union Cavalry"", John A. Macaulay's discussion of observation balloons, and a recounting of the use of the telegraph technology as a system of modern 'information flow' by Seymour E. Goodman.  The two chapters which really stand out as relative novelties are undoubtedly Sarah Jones Weicksel's look at the potential use of body armor (and its rejection on a point of 'manhood' and 'the politics of mortality') and Tom D. Crouch's research on Civil War 'dreams' to design and deploy actual heavier-than-air flying machines such as proto-helicopters for recon and attack.  This is fantastic.</p><p>And yet <i>Astride Two Worlds</i> occasionally misses out on some wider contexts which are useful when attempting to define the role of technology in the American Civil War.  As the editor notes in his own essay, this ""was both the last great preindustrial war and the first major war of the industrial age"", which to a critical reader seems an equivocation evading a tough question.  What about the Crimean War (1853-1856) between Russia, Great Britain, France and Turkey, ending just five years before the Civil War began?  After all, the most important pre-war analysis of 'The Art of War' was published in America just as the Secession Crisis of 1860 forced professional military and naval officers to take sides, North or South.  This was a huge, in-depth study of not just Crimean War campaigns such as the Siege of Sevastopol (which American officers like George B. McClellan famously observed as part of the formal U.S. military commission there) but a fully-illustrated, meticulously-detailed report on the latest European military and naval technologies and practices in general.</p>    <p>Some of this might be down to careful word-play.  So what's the difference, for example, between 'great' and 'major'?  If the American Civil War was larger and more intensive than the Crimean War (something few historians would argue against) what exactly made it so?  Perhaps it wasn't so much about technological means as political ends which determined <i>how many would die before there was peace</i>, and if so, did the latter dictate the former's impact as major or not?  Hence, the Crimean War -- which featured rifled muskets, telegraph communications, steam-powered logistics by ship and rail, exploding shell-fire and trenchworks, as well as ironclad warships -- is mentioned only in passing; by Goodman's essay (Chapter 4), and in the excellent sixth chapter on ""Confederate Spar-Torpedo Boats"" by Jorit Wintjes.  'Sevastopol' isn't noted in the index at all, neither is Major Richard Delafield, Corps of Engineers, a former superintendent of West Point in charge of New York City's harbor defences and author of the Crimean War commission's official report, <i>The Art of the War in Europe</i> (1860), before becoming Chief Engineer in 1864.</p>  <p>Likewise, the editor notes in his introductory chapter that the Union turreted ironclad USS <i>Monitor</i> was the sole ""wartime invention""[which] significantly affected the course of the war"", and that this was ""the first time in history"" that a ""a new weapon was designed, developed, and deployed during the same war.""  But it's fairly well known that John Ericsson, the <i>Monitor</i>'s inventor, first pitched the concept of a 'sub-aquatic system' of naval warfare (solely steam-powered, screw-propelled, fully armored and with a revolving turret) to French Emperor Napoleon III during the Crimean War.  Its purpose was to penetrate the gauntlet of granite forts guarding the main Russian naval base at Cronstadt (St. Petersburg), sink all of the wooden men-of-war sheltering there, and then steam back out safely enough.  Following the rejection of his proposal by France, Ericsson's model collected dust in his home until 1861, when U.S. agents took a sudden, dramatic interest in the concept.  It was therefore no coincidence that when naming his extraordinary vessel in January 1862 Ericsson stated it would ""admonish the leaders of the Southern Rebellion that the batteries on the banks of their rivers will no longer present barriers to the entrance of the Union forces.""  But then he also added that British leaders both in the Admiralty and 'Downing Street' ""would hardly view with indifference this last 'Yankee notion,' this monitor.""  The American Civil War wasn't just 'astride two worlds' temporally, but spatially astride the 'Old' and 'New' worlds, inasmuch as events on one side of the Atlantic increasingly affected strategic interests on the other.</p><p>In closing, this work is presented very well, wisely interspacing photos and illustrations in the various chapters rather than a middle insert section.  Endnotes, on the other hand, would have been preferable than in-text parentheses.  For one, they allow for fuller reference-citations which include page numbers not just author names, publication year and perhaps chapters.  An edited collection of essays especially ought to map out precisely where to go for further reading and tracing contributors' research as precisely as possible.</p><p><i>Howard J.

6513	9780814783047	$55.00	Elizabeth Cady Stanton and the Feminist Foundations of Family Law		Thomas, Tracy A			"Family Law's Radical Origins<p>Elizabeth Cady Stanton was a woman far ahead of her time with regard to her advocacy for women's rights within the family. Tracy A. Thomas, Professor of family law and a feminist legal historian, argues that Stanton believed a radical challenge to family law was vital to the woman's rights agenda. Stanton asserted that four institutions: government, church, family, and industry acted symbiotically to keep women in a subordinate status. The public and private spheres were not separate, but intertwined and they operated in myriad ways to discriminate and hinder women and stifle equality. Thomas states that Stanton and many other nineteenth-century women's rights advocates had a fluid notion of feminism, one that embraced both the sameness and differences between men and women. Women were equal not inferior to men, but women were different because they could procreate while men could not so in addition to the vote, Stanton also promoted rights that extended to women as mothers. The greatest hurdle to achieving equal rights for women was that too many people confounded differences with inferiority. The rest of the populace was apathetic. The solution to the problem of women's inequality was complete formal legal equality. The question was how best to achieve it.</p>	<p>Thomas agrees with those scholars who claim the effort to pass the married women's property laws rather than the campaign to abolish slavery was the start of the women's rights movement. Stanton herself began her activism in the movement advocating for married women's property rights in New York. As a propertied married woman herself, Stanton lobbied the New York legislature to pass a law to protect married women's rights to their own property. New York got the law in 1848, but Stanton criticized its neglect to include earnings protection and its failure to recognize jointly owned property. She also insisted that propertied married women deserved the right to vote. Later, Stanton severely criticized judges who narrowly construed the law and who tended to favor traditional doctrines instead.</p>  <p>Scholars have long demeaned Stanton and many of her associates in the early women's rights movement as racist and class biased. Thomas acknowledges that Stanton did universalize her claims for all women, but she notes that Stanton would counter that the laws that discriminated against women universalized them as well. The legal and political significance of universalizing women in the fight to eliminate or reform discriminatory laws was to mitigate their destructive effects on all women. All women suffered under the same social, political, legal, and religious disabilities and all women would reap the rewards from the utter obliteration of deleterious systems and institutions. Further, Thomas observed that Stanton supported her long-time friend Frederick Douglass's marriage to Helen Pitts, a white woman. It was not the first time Stanton had encouraged interracial marriage. She had attended legislative hearings in Boston to support the repeal of miscegenation laws.</p><p>Stanton faced criticism for her positions regarding the family from anti-feminists and conservative feminists in her own day. Reforming the family's patriarchal structure and the laws that controlled it in Stanton's mind began with the complete elimination of coverture, a feudal remnant of the common law, that she saw as the primary mechanism of married women's oppression. In its place, Stanton offered a contractual theory of marriage that included what today is called ""no-fault"" divorce and that saw men and women as equal partners in the union. Women should not be defined by their place in a family but by their unique individuality, intellect, and capacity for work. Stanton failed to achieve this new kind of marriage as most people opted for the more traditional structure, a failure she blamed on men's efforts to keep women in a subordinate status. Stanton herself never divorced her husband even though she was in a loveless marriage to a man who neither supported his wife's activism nor financially, or emotionally, supported his own family. Indeed, she often used the fact that she had been married for several decades to highlight her familiarity with the institution of marriage and its discriminations. She continued to attack coverture for the rest of her life and even called upon the Supreme Court to declare marriage laws in violation of the Thirteenth Amendment.</p>	<p>Stanton's feminist attack on the oppressive structures of marriage was radical in that she framed women's inequality as systemic victimization. Marriage laws sexualized women and created a sanctuary for male lust through protection of the husband's marital right, a vestige of coverture that shielded men who raped their wives. At the Tenth Annual Convention, Stanton said marriage was legalized prostitution, a claim intended to shock her audience. Women give up everything when they wed while men gave up nothing. Marriage was analogous to slavery in many ways. Man was the master and woman had to obey him. Upon marriage woman's identity became submerged into that of her husband and she literally no longer existed in the eyes of the law. Stanton lauded Lucy Stone who kept her maiden name after she wed Henry Blackwell. Stanton herself demanded she be called Elizabeth Cady Stanton rather than Mrs. Henry Stanton to express her independent identity. This was less radical than Stone, but still radical for her time.</p>	<p>Stanton held many of the same positions as those in the ""free love"" movement, though she denied being an adherent. She did overtly advocate for voluntary motherhood because she believed women had a legal right to refuse sex with her husband. She used the furor over Mormon polygyny to further criticize the institution of marriage. Stanton was a staunch supporter of maternal rights to children. Lauding the new doctrines of ""best interest of the child"" and ""tender years,"" which gave some custody rights to some mothers, she at the same time, criticized them for relying on gender stereotypes. Her personal views on birth control are not clear. She mentioned abortion only once in all her extant writings. In a letter to the Seventh Annual Convention in 1856, Stanton claimed it was the consequence of sexual violence and involuntary motherhood. She did not campaign with physicians who sought to criminalize abortion and she expressed opposition to any and all laws that denied women sovereignty over themselves.</p><p>At the end of the nineteenth century, a group of young, conservative women's suffragists took control of the movement and kicked Stanton out. Undaunted, Stanton took to the lecture circuit where she got paid to speak to large groups of people who were interested in her radicalism. She did well on tour and earned enough money to put all her children through college. In many of her talks Stanton called for education reform. She wanted girls trained to be independent and boys socialized without male privilege. Educating children at an early age to express their intelligence, creativity, and independence was the path to radically reforming society.</p> <p>By the end of Stanton's life, family law had changed, but not as radically as Stanton had desired. It would not be until the last quarter of the twentieth century and the second women's rights movement that nearly all of her recommendations came to fruition. She truly was a woman far ahead of her time. Tracy Thomas has thoroughly documented Stanton's radicalism on matters of marriage and the family and has shown just how significantly one woman's feminism affected family law for the betterment of women.</p><p><i>Mary R.

6409	9780809334902	$19.50	Jefferson, Lincoln, and the Unfinished Work of the Nation		Hatzenbuehler, Ronald L.			"Finding the Nation: Jefferson, Lincoln, and the Development of American Constitutionalism<p>At first glance, a direct comparative analysis of two famous individuals like Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln would seem to be a fairly straightforward endeavor. Both men sit in the same pantheon of rarified air of ""Great Americans"" and former presidents. Both left copious primary source collections, and each is the subject of his own massive historical literature; there are in fact considerable numbers of historians who identify as ""Jefferson scholars"" and ""Lincoln scholars."" Both were serious thinkers with much to say about the American experiment, and their ideas often intersected in the same broad areas of the nation's intellectual life: freedom, liberty, the ongoing strengths and weaknesses of American democracy. </p><p>But such a project poses serious challenges, as well. Their ideas may have overlapped, but Lincoln and Jefferson came from very different backgrounds in different time periods, and were in many ways different in their personalities and temperaments. Another question also presents itself: what exactly are we comparing? Their respective biographies? Personalities? Psychological backgrounds? Ideologies? Without a careful delineation of some third thing -- ""Lincoln, Jefferson, and""""?"" -- the narrative risks turning itself into a sort of historical tennis match, bouncing back and forth between the two men with no real narrative coherence. </p><p><i>Jefferson, Lincoln, and the Unfinished Work of the Nation</i> happily avoids this difficulty, making clear from the outset that Hatzenbeuhler is primarily interested in how these two men understood and articulated a sense of the American nation as a community. He places particular emphasis on the ""unfinished"" part (a phrase Hatzenbeuhler derives from Lincoln's Gettysburg Address), arguing that ""neither [Lincoln nor Jefferson] reached closure on many of the important topics of his day (p. 5)."" This especially included matters related to race and slavery, which in different ways bedeviled both men, but more generally also includes an examination of the ongoing and contentious debates, in both Jefferson's and Lincoln's era, about politics and American constitutionalism. </p><p>These debates garner the bulk of Hatzenbeuhler's attention; his book is fundamentally a political and constitutional work of scholarship. He takes a topical approach to these issues, centering his chapters around each man's perspective on the nature of partisan politics in the American republic, the debates regarding federalism and the relationship between state and federal authority, government power and economic growth, and the role God and religious played in American public life. His comparative analysis of each issue is solid, accurate, and firmly rooted in the requisite sources. When analyzing their respective ideas about political economy, for example, Hatzenbeuhler observes that ""Jefferson encouraged government leaders to pass laws that favored agriculture over commerce or industry,"" while Lincoln tended to favor government-sponsored programs of internal improvements that benefited not just farmers but the nation's burgeoning industrial and market sectors as well (p. 95). ""Both Jefferson and Lincoln saw labor, not capital, as the basis of wealth and formed their ideas regarding the proper role of government in promoting economic growth as encouraging people to engage in what Lincoln termed ""useful labour (p. 113)."" </p><p>These are useful insights, but they will not come as any particular surprise to Lincoln or Jefferson scholars. Where Hatzenbeuhler is more original is his extended discussion in the latter chapters of his book of each man's ""sense of place,"" their ideas regarding community and how they related to the nation as a whole. ""Both men tried to foster change, Jefferson in his ""country"" and Lincoln in his nation,"" Hatzenbuehler observes, ""Ultimately, Lincoln was more successful in his goal than Jefferson, because they understood place differently. Put succinctly, for Jefferson <i>place</i> defined a <i>people</i>. For Lincoln, <i>people</i> defined a <i>place</i> (p. 115).""</p> <p>By this Hatzenbuehler means that Jefferson habitually used Virginia as his lodestone to use as a way of assessing other people and places; and he was, to his credit, able to see that Virginia had its shortcomings, particularly in its dependence on slave labor. But at the end of the day, Jefferson could not really transcend the values and norms of the Virginia gentry; he could not really mount an effective critique of Virginia's racial caste system and its oppressive slave system. ""He did not follow through with what he knew needed to be done,"" Hatzenbuehler writes, ""he accommodated to the way things were and contented himself with the personal satisfaction that he had done all he could for Virginia (p. 125)."" </p><p>Lincoln, on the other hand, was not so inflexibly wedded to the places in which he grew up and practiced law and politics (Kentucky, Indiana, and Illinois) or even the nation which he led that he could not transcend their limitations and provide real political and social change via the Emancipation Proclamation and the Thirteenth Amendment. More concerned with people than places, Lincoln ""moved beyond local attachments,"" according to Hatzenbeuhler, and ""in doing so, was able to redefine himself (p. 126)."" More to the point, Lincoln was able to redefine the nation. Jefferson was big; Lincoln was just a bit bigger. </p><p>This is an interesting and original insight. One wishes Hatzenbeuhler had gone further, however, and explained more fully just why this matters -- not just in our understanding of Lincoln and Jefferson as individuals, but American community and nationalism overall. He rightly observes that these two men's ideas are still vitally important to civic debates today, but he does not devote enough attention to explaining exactly how or why this is so. What does this Lincolnian approach's relative success <i>vis</i> Jefferson tell us about the nature of American nationalism and the role of reform in a democracy? What could it tell us about the breakdown of the Union before the Civil War, or the failures of Reconstruction afterwards? Hatzenbeuhler does not really delve very deeply into these questions, which are the natural outgrowth of his own fascinating insights. </p><p>These are not the complaints of a reviewer criticizing a bad book; rather, they are the complaints of a reviewer who has read a good, intriguing book and wishes for more. In some ways, this exploration of Lincoln and Jefferson's ideas about an unfinished nation feels a bit like an unfinished book. More could be done here, and one hopes that perhaps someday the author will produce another work which builds upon a promising beginning.</p><p><i>Brian R.

6356	1594162484	$28.00	The Confederacy at Flood Tide: The Political and Military Ascension, June to December 1862		Leigh, Philip			"Flood Tide: A Decisive Moment<p>Philip Leigh's book, <i>The Confederacy at Flood Tide</i>, begins with the Peninsula Campaign, the beginning of the flood tide, and ends with the Emancipation Proclamation, ""the most decisive event of the flood-tide period"" (204).  The author lays out his theses in the Introduction explaining why he uses ""flood tide"" rather than ""high tide"" which many readers might associate with Pickett's charge at Gettysburg.  Leigh maintains it was during this time that the European powers were most likely to have recognized the Confederacy and possibly intervened or pursued policies that could have meant Confederate success.  He explains that either Confederate independence or Union victory depended not only on military factors but on espionage, as well as diplomatic and political events. </p><p>The author, in his well-written book,  uses many  secondary,  as well as, a few published primary sources to support his theses.  While he ends each chapter with a brief summary of political events and  diplomatic maneuvering of European powers, especially England and France, the  principal focus is on the military aspects of the war.  He includes well drawn maps of the battles and campaigns of which those illustrating Robert E. Lee's actions are the easiest to follow. </p><p>The chapter dealing with Emancipation Proclamation stands out in that it demonstrates Abraham Lincoln's gradual change from tentativeness to fully embracing emancipation.  It demonstrates Lincoln's shift in rhetoric from questioning the wisdom of  the policy urged by more radical Republicans since the first days of the war to the actual issuing of the Emancipation Proclamation in spite of the fears of some Americans and Europeans that such a move would inspire slave insurrections and possible genocide. </p>  <p>Leigh keeps the general reader's interest in that he enlivens the military narrative with a combination of short personal biographical information about  major military figures, comments by combatants that bring to life the everyday activities  of soldiers or comments of major historians concerning the  significance of major events.   For instance on page 31 he  quotes from  James McPherson  on Major General John B. Magruder's colorful activities during the Seven Days battles:  ""The grey-costumed thespians responded enthusiastically. . . .{and} stentorian voices called out orders to imaginary troops in the wood.""  He especially uses anecdotes, some well-known, to add to the military descriptions. He cites on page 6 a comment  from William Watson, a British citizen living in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, taken from  Amanda Foreman to describe the corruption of Benjamin Butler :  ""Butler continues to hunt for treason, and all material that could contribute to it he confiscated.  He found it existed extensively in the vaults of banks . . . .""  In addition, Leigh adds references  soldiers' lives with their personal anecdotes in order to bring humor to the military narrative.  In order to illustrate the crushing boredom experienced by all soldiers,  on page 25, he cites  Private Sam Watkins', who served with Company H of the first Tennessee infantry, a story which Leigh claims rivals  Mark Twain's story ""The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County"":  ""The boys would frequently have a louse race.  There was one fellow [Dornin] who was winning all the money. . . .  We could not understand  it. . . . . The lice were placed on plates  . . .and the first that crawled off was the winner.  At last  we found Dornin's trick;  he always heated his plate.""  In addition, on page 120, he uses the well-known possible myth of Barbara Frietchie waving a Union flag when Stonewall Jackson's troops marched by her home  at the beginning of the Maryland campaign. </p>      <p>Leigh writes an engaging  account of this crucial year using this technique of quoting from many sources. As a result the battle narrative moves along quickly without getting bogged down in the  many details of  tactics or strategies of the many military engagements and campaigns. The book is highly recommended for amateur historians and for libraries catering to the general public  and undergraduates.  Its bibliography offers  a good beginning reference for those who wish for more detailed studies. </p>    <p>Philip Leigh authored <i>Trading with the Enemy: The Covert Economy During the American Civil War</i> (2014)  and <i>Lee's Lost Dispatches and Other Civil War and Controversies</i> (2015).  He also contributed twenty-four articles to the <i>New York Times</i> ""Disunion"" series. He edited the memoir of Sam Watkins, <i>Co.

6337	9780806152097	$29.95	Fort Bascom: Soldiers, Comancheros, and Indians in the Canadian River Valley		Blackshear, James Bailey			"Fort Bascom <p>Our understanding of the Civil War era's brutal fighting and unfinished reconciliation has long stopped on the eastern edge of the Great Plains. But scholars have lately expanded the <i>long</i> Civil War and Reconstruction into the American West and, by doing so, have started to slowly redefine the conflict's geographical and conceptual framework. Scholars like Adam Arenson, Andrew R. Graybill, Megan Kate Nelson, Virginia Scharff, and others have recently shown the rich and textured history of the American West in the Civil War era not only from a regional view but from a national perspective, challenging the eastern-focused paradigm of Civil War studies. In short, historians have moved the Civil War west. James Bailey Blackshear's exhaustively researched and well-narrated <i>Fort Bascom: Soldiers, Comancheros, and Indians in the Canadian River Valley</i> is a valuable addition to this growing westward-focused historiography. For Blackshear, Fort Bascom represents something of a lens through which to view and understand the diverse people who lived, fought, traded, and passed through northeastern New Mexico and the Texas Panhandle in the 1860s and 1870s. Blackshear contends that Fort Bascom was not only a critically important military outpost in the region, but that it also played a significant, if short-lived, role in Comanchero, white, and Indian trade networks. </p> <p>Blackshear's work is the most recent and comprehensive examination of Fort Bascom. It is difficult to imagine a more robust and detailed history of the fort and its place in the Civil War era West. Place biographies like this are valuable, and Blackshear's focus on Fort Bascom provides a central thread with which to tie together and explore in a clear narrative the cultural, military, economic, and environmental history of the region. Further, Blackshear engages borderlands history in helpful ways by illustrating the complex military and economic relationships between American soldiers, Comancheros, Comanche, Kiowa, Navajos, Puebloans on the border of the Llano Estacado and Commancheria during one of the most tumultuous times in that region's (and American) history. </p> <p>Union forces and local laborers built Fort Bascom in 1863 in order to guard the major thoroughfares from Arkansas and Texas as well as protect American interests from hostile Indians -- namely the Comanche and Kiowa. Located in northeastern New Mexico near present day Tucumcari, Fort Bascom was generally well situated to oversee the vast and harsh region along the western Canadian River Valley and the Llano Estacado -- a massive mesa encompassing over 35,000 square miles. And thanks to it being situated on the western edge of the lower Great Plains, the fort became the closest and most prominent Federal redoubt facing Confederate Texas as well as thousands of Kiowa and Comanche Indians. </p> <p>Perhaps Fort Bascom's most enduring impact occurred after the Civil War ended and the Indian Wars ramped-up in the region, and here is where Blackshear devotes the majority of his study. Blackshear nicely conveys the especially brutal <i>total</i> war that raged throughout the region -- a style of warfare brought to bear by the likes of Gens. William Tecumseh Sherman and Philip Sheridan. Sherman and Sheridan had practiced elements of this style of fighting during the Civil War, and they employed it with devastating effect against the Native Americans. Just as the nation struggled to reconstruct and reconcile the South following the war, people in the West now suffered a wrenching period of often bloody and always troubled racial, cultural, and political transformation and conquest. Fort Bascom, Blackshear makes clear, was situated at the center of this pointed struggle. As historian Elliott West has shown, the post-war South did not hold a monopoly on race-centered, broken, and bloody agitation for reconciliation -- far from it. To be sure, the West as a region had become an unparalleled ""ethnic stew"" defined by violence, conquest, and ever-shifting boundaries. Using Fort Bascom as a cultural, racial, and ethnic backdrop, Blackshear confirms this remarkable diversity and brutality. </p> <p>Blackshear also invokes the natural environment's critically important role in shaping the human experience at Fort Bascom. The harsh terrain and arid climate that defines northeast New Mexico and northwest Texas made life at the fort especially difficult for those American soldiers unaccustomed to the region. Blackshear provides an impressive analysis of the <i>science</i> behind the environment -- something that environmental historians will find especially gratifying and useful. He also shows in compelling ways how American soldiers dealt with, or succumbed to, the grim environment compared to the better adjusted local New Mexicans, Commancheros, and Indians. Here Blackshear delves into detailed logistics based on careful and thorough research to show how the fort remained operational and productive in the middle of a largely desolate landscape. </p> <p>Blackshear's book is a fine and much needed contribution to an exciting and critically important movement in Civil War era scholarship, and it is a solid addition to western, environmental, and borderlands historiography. More specifically, Blackshear's study pulls from the shadows a fort and a region that deserves a prominent spot on our geographical and conceptual radar, especially as scholars continue to reevaluate and reinterpret the West's place in the greater Civil War and Reconstruction. </p> <p><i>Matthew M.

6342	9780252039959	$40.00	Women, Work, and Worship in Lincoln\'s Country: The Dumville Family Letters		Heinz, Anne M.	Heinz, John P		"Four Women's Stories<p>In 1840 the Dumville family left England and settled in the American Midwest.  They joined the millions of European, chiefly German and Irish, who immigrated to United States in the 1840s and 1850s.  Thanks to the meticulous research by the editors of <i>Women, Work, and Worship in Lincoln's Country: The Dumville Family Letters</i> readers can view a photo of the ship's manifest showing Dumvilles' names upon arrival in New York City.  Thomas Dumville, the patriarch, died two years later, leaving his wife Ann a widow tasked with raising three girls - Elizabeth, Jemima, and Hephzibah - amidst the farm country of central Illinois. The four women's lives cover three centuries. In 1796, the year of Anne Dumville's birth, George Washington urged his compatriots to refrain from entanglement with the politics of a fractious Europe. Anne's second daughter, Jemima, died in 1919, the year when millions of American troops were returning home from Europe after decisively intervening in Europe's ""Great War."" </p> <p>The lives of rural middle-class women in the Civil War era come to light thanks to Anne M. Heinz and John P. Heinz's fine edition of the Dumville letters, now archived at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library in Springfield, Illinois. In the preface to <i>Women, Work, and Worship</i> the Heinzs provide a backstory to the letters and a helpful discussion of the writing conventions of the mid-nineteenth century. As the editors have noted, the three Dumville daughters improved in spelling, grammar, and syntax as the years progressed. Writers with modest income had to be economical since paper, envelopes, and stamps were relatively expensive. Yet, as other scholars have pointed out, the antebellum period saw a revolution in communication and transportation that transformed American social, economic, and political life. The Dumville sisters entered adulthood and the start of their epistolary careers at time when commoners could afford to write on a regular basis and had access to a nationwide postal system. </p> <p>The commentary at the beginning of each section provides a useful primer for readers unfamiliar with the major social, political, and economic trends in the antebellum period. Along with their well-crafted and well-researched footnotes, the editorial notes greatly enhance the reader's engagement with the letters and the world that the Dumville women inhabited.  The commentary by itself is a worth a read; the editors write in a very accessible style and they show a deft understanding of the historical trends and issues of the era. <p>Religion, specifically of the Methodist persuasion, permeated the lives of the Dumville women. The Dumvilles sincerely believed in the doctrines of the faith and proved themselves articulate, intelligent, and observant of both religious precepts and of the human condition. Yet, women did not hold positions of leadership in the Methodist congregations. Like most women, the Dumvilles had little access to the channels of formal power in this most powerful of human social institutions. </p> <p>The letters frequently mention revivals, pastors and preachers, and conversions, and deathbed reconciliations with the Almighty. Indeed, death and disease provided a steady staple of epistolary content. The letters contain frequent references to measles, scarlet fever, ""tyfoid,"" ""bilious fever,"" and ""congestion of the brain."" One of the earliest letters in the collection, dated ""July the 18th 1852"" mentions ""the death of Mr. Louis"" who ""has left a Widow and Six Childeron [sic] to mourn his lost."" (27) Other topics also made regular appearances.  Hephzibah suggested in one letter to her sister Jemima in 1857, ""I will try to write a few words on the topics which are attracting general attention, which are Matrimony, Cold Weather, and Small Pocks."" (67) On the subject of matrimony, all three Dumville daughters went on to marry, though Jemima and Hephzibah did not enter the conjugal state until both women were in their early thirties. </p> <p>Though far removed from the corridors of national power, central Illinois in the last two decades of before the Civil War felt the full force of transnational events. The housing shortage in Jacksonville, where the Jemima and Hephzibah lived during their teenage years, arose in part to the large wave of Irish and German immigrants settling in the area. Though Hephzibah proclaimed in 1856 that ""I do not desire"" the ""privilege of voting,"" the sisters' writings strongly suggest that they were invested in the political controversies of the time.  The letters, especially from Hephzibah, contain numerous references to leading Illinois politicians like John Yates, Stephen Douglass, and Abraham Lincoln.  Hephzibah even referred to Lincoln in March 1861 as ""the man for the hour.""  A century before the historians reached a consensus on the issue, Hephzibah in a September 1856 letter hit dead-on the fundamental root cause of the nation's political troubles: ""the Southern states with their African slavery, the desire of some to extend it and determination of others to abolish it."" (62) Jemima in an 1859 letter mentions ""poor Brown who was taken at Harpers Ferry"" and other ""awful events in Virginia."" (101) By mid-war, the Dumville sisters, like many other Northerners, had turned decisively against slavery. In March 1862 Jemima wrote, ""I firmly believe peace never will be restored unto us until we as a nation""place our feet upon the neck of the monster slavery."" (143) </p> <p>What the Dumville women thought of emancipation and Reconstruction remains a mystery. As the editors admit, missing is ""the complete record of their correspondence"" in the postwar years. (xv) Still, what we do have tell a remarkable story of the everyday lives and extraordinary events of mid-nineteenth century America. The editors have made a strong case for the vibrancy and historical significance of women's personal writings. ""The Dumville letters,"" they correctly point out, ""are a small counterweight to the dominant, elite, masculine perspective."" (21) Like intellectual fingerprints on the ledger of history, each letter reveals the distinctiveness of each woman's view of herself and the world around her. Thanks to the solid editorial work by the Heinzs, the voices of commoners, of lower-class people, of women in the American heartland struggling to control their destinies, are now heard and cherished. </p> <p><i>L.

6343	9780252080869	$28.00	Free Labor: The Civil War and the Making of an American Working Class		Lause, Mark A.			"From Battlefield to Pickett Line: American Labor Redefined<p>In <i>Free Labor: The Civil War and the Making of an American Working Class</i>, Mark Lause seeks to rectify what he calls an oversight in the history of the Civil War. Neither Civil War historians nor labor historians, he contends, have adequately examined how the war contributed to the making of an American working class. Lause imports to the American setting E. P. Thompson's framework for studying the making of an English working class. The implication of this approach is that it forces Lause to emphasize social class formation as a process where workers identified themselves as a distinct segment of society with unique concerns. Lause suggests that the first years of the war decimated the labor movement. Workers were forced to rebuild in 1863 and 1864, only to run up against the heavy hand of government power in 1864 and 1865. Lause concludes that the Civil War produced an American working class with the central characteristics of pursuing respectability and avoiding mass strikes -- tactics that largely excluded African Americans, unskilled immigrants, and women and that guided the labor movement's tactics for decades to come. </p><p>Potential readers should not be turned off by Lause's framing of the study as an intervention in the historiography of class formation. This is not a book that is heavy on theory. Nor does Lause use the study as a venue to grind an ideological ax. Instead, it is a history of working people's experiences during the Civil War. Lause organizes the book in four parts that proceed chronologically. He makes clear attempts to be inclusive, which for this topic necessitates addressing the various characteristics of workers -- skilled, unskilled, white, black, male, female, native-born, immigrant -- and their geographical locations. The nature of economic development meant that most of the union organizing and strike activity occurred in the North, but Lause includes sections on key southern cities such as Richmond, Nashville, and New Orleans. The breadth of this book -- an attempt at a national analysis of the entire war in less than two hundred pages -- is one of its strengths and key contributions. </p><p>In many ways this is a book written for labor historians, but Civil War historians will find insights and provocative interpretations as well. One of the most compelling aspects of the book is Lause's ability to track a handful of individual workers from the eve of war through the conflict. He shows how they went from the picket lines to the front lines. He places trade unionists in the midst of campaigns and key battles with particular emphasis on Gettysburg. The most interesting example is Alonzo Draper. Draper went from leading the great Lynn shoemakers strike of 1860 to the battlefields of emancipation, commanding the 36th Infantry United States Colored Troops, and connecting antebellum land reform arguments to the importance of land for freed people. While Draper exhibited a continuity of ideas, Civil War experiences had transformative effects for others. Before the war George Washington Beidel, a member of the National Typographical Union (NTU), viewed abolition and blacks negatively. His war experiences purified his prejudice. Before his death in March of 1864, Beidel had come to equate slavery with sin and fraternize with his fellow black comrades. Lause uses examples such as these to show how the war could strengthen unionists' pre-war beliefs in some cases and transform them in others. </p><p>In addition to individual experiences, Lause examines the reemergence of the labor movement between 1863 and 1865 that featured the strike wave of 1863 and numerous other workplace actions. Paying greater attention than many previous scholars to these labor conflicts allows Lause to illustrate an important dynamic between the federal government and the citizenry during the war. He argues that the state embraced a new role of arbiter of labor disputes during the last years of the war that would have profound implications on labor relations and the making of the working class in the coming decades. Lause's examination of these strikes contributes to an understanding of the growing power of the federal government and connects to the scholarly project of better understanding the ""Long Civil War,"" as advocated by Aaron Sheehan-Dean. </p><p>No look at workers during the Civil War would be complete without a few words on the New York City Draft Riots in 1863. Lause challenges many of the previous interpretations of this event. Too often, he suggests, Civil War historians confine the appearance of workers to these bloody days, which has the effect of ascribing the rage to the entire working class, misconstruing who participated, and simplifying the causes. The actions of workers varied. Lause suggests that much of the city's workforce did not participate in the mayhem. Some took up defensive positions either in their roles as soldiers in the Union Army or in the NTU-mobilized protection of the offices of the <i>New York Tribune</i>. Others denounced the riots as inimical to the republic rather than as effective protests against conscription. A few labor reformers stepped into the fray on the side of African Americans. Instead of viewing the riots as representative of a unified working-class response to conscription and fears of economic competition, Lause urges historians to interpret the violence more complexly and recognize how both political parties shaped the narrative of events that informed later histories. </p> <p>While the book provides an account of what workers did between 1860 and 1865, we learn relatively little about their motivations, whether in fighting the war or rebuilding their unions, or what they thought about their actions. When Lause discusses Alonzo Draper's leadership of black troops in 1863, for example, he provides no interpretation about the former union leader's motives. More broadly, the concept that provides the title of the book -- free labor -- receives scant attention. Readers hoping to learn more about what workers thought about free labor or how the ideas associated with it might have motivated them will need to look elsewhere. The absences of sustained analysis of motivations or discussions of free labor from a worker's point of view may be best attributed to sources. Labor historians are constantly frustrated by the paucity of what workers left behind when trying to understand their interior lives, a point Lause acknowledges impacted his work. Overall, this book rests on an impressive body of research, which suggests the silences are more reflective of the sources than disinterest or oversight on the part of the author. </p><p>Whereas Lause's key accomplishment in the book is telling a history of the labor movement during the Civil War, he suggests his main purpose is to explain how the Civil War contributed to the ""making of an American working class"" (x). This purpose fades from view as the chapters unfold. There is a tendency for the author to let the events speak for themselves rather than provide an interpretation that connects events to claims and the claims to a central argument, which is perhaps most noticeable in the chapters devoted to African Americans, unskilled immigrants, and women. This writing style introduces opportunity for the author's key points to be missed or, worse, misinterpreted. Patient readers will be rewarded, however, as Lause brings the key points together toward the end of the book. He concludes that workers' wartime experiences, participation in strikes, and treatment as objects of government repression created a working class that sought a respectable status that would allow it to achieve its goals through politics. The price of respectability was perpetuating paternalism to marginalize women workers and avoiding using strength in numbers and the mass strike -- tactics that had been stigmatized as unworthy of respectable white workers by their association with African Americans and immigrants during the war. Thus, Lause explains how the war created some of the dominant features of the labor movement that emerged from the war and why the skilled white working class sought to distance itself from other workers -- a near-mortal wound that would take more than three-quarters of a century to heal, even if then only partially. </p><p>Anyone wanting to learn more about how the Civil War impacted the labor movement and how workers experienced the conflict would do well to read this book. It is Lause's tenth book and reflects the work of a scholar who has devoted a career to understanding the Civil War and nineteenth-century United States history. He offers a history of labor's Civil War, and provides an important contribution to labor historians' study of working-class formation. </p><p><i>Michael K.

6456	9781469628752	$35.00	Braxton Bragg: The Most Hated Man in the Confederacy		Hess, Earl J.			"From Infamy to Intrigue: Braxton Bragg Revised<p>One of Earl Hess's great gifts as an author is that he can take a topic we all talk about but which tend to be inglorious -- fortifications, infantry tactics, rifled muskets -- and then creates essential contributions to our Civil War libraries. He has done so again with his latest endeavor, a biography of <i>Braxton Bragg: The Most Hated Man in the Confederacy</i>.</p><p> ""One need only mention [Bragg's] name at a Civil War round table meeting to bring a guffaw from someone who will make a snide comment about the general,"" Hess writes in his prologue, explaining the fundamental problem of writing about his subject (xi). Yet Hess rightfully contends that Bragg was ""a complex and important individual who deserves much more from students and historians than to be made the butt of unfounded ridicule"" (xix). </p><p>The challenge Hess lays out for himself with the book -- and for readers -- sounds deceptively simple: ""We have to approach Bragg from a clear perspective and take him for what he was while rejecting the old image that has become a comforting but unfair view of the man and his military career"" (xiii). </p><p>Hess does this by effectively aggregating dozens of wildly diverse contemporary opinions about Bragg, which he then sifts through, organizes, and insightfully assesses. He also outlines the historiography of Bragg biography, then draws on that historiography throughout the book to contextualize his own assessments. The resulting work is not, as Hess admits, a full-fledged biography but rather a careful and more objective analysis of Bragg's Civil War career. </p> <p>However, Hess does draw enough detail from the rest of Bragg's life to give his study firm grounding. As the owner of a mid-sized Louisiana sugar plantation, Bragg devoted himself to the Confederate cause because of his own entrenchment within the Confederate plantation culture. ""Like most Southerners, Bragg considered the peculiar institution of slavery to be not so peculiar at all,"" Hess writes (10). Hess also uses the ""ardent & devoted"" relationship between Bragg and his wife as an important lens (5). </p><p>Bragg is best known -- and scorned with relish -- for the maelstrom of bad blood between him and his subordinates. ""His record of success while shaping the Army of Tennessee and leading it longer than any other individual was severely tarnished and corrupted by the controversies that erupted from his ill-advised dealings with recalcitrant officers,"" Hess laments (xx). Hess walks readers through each of these many controversies, playing fair-handed referee. </p> <p>Of particular note is Hess's excellent treatment of the controversy that arose following Bragg's failed Kentucky campaign in October of 1862. An eventual split between Bragg and former Vice President John C. Breckenridge, a Kentuckian, had its seeds in the campaign, as well -- one of many relationships that would sour over the course of Bragg's tenure. Hess carefully traces both sides of the long-running feud until eventually -- surprisingly -- it mellowed after the war. </p><p>As anyone familiar with Bragg knows, one might pick any number of his subordinates as a case study in high-profile, long-running rancor: Benjamin Cheatham, William Hardee, Leonidas Polk, D. H. Hill, James Longstreet, and on. Hess gives air to their grievances, but he reminds readers that they were often ""willful, unreliable subordinates who could not be counted on to obey orders or cooperate with their commander"" (168). Bragg's problems, in short, were not all of Bragg's making. ""Historians have tended to see Bragg as the actor in creating a circle of negativity around him,"" Hess says of these controversies, ""but we must also understand that he was in turn deeply affected by the actions and opinions of others"" (xii). Hess gives everyone a fair hearing, but the cumulative effect is that Bragg deserves more benefit of the doubt than critics have generally given him. </p> <p>One of the book's great strengths is that Hess assigns blame and credit equally, for everyone concerned, and only when due. This is particularly admirable when writing about a subject like Bragg, who becomes such easy sport for detractors.

""There is no substitute for a general's postwar view of his career,"" Hess contends; ""Bragg should have written his memoirs and braved whatever criticism came his way in the same fashion he braved the storm of abuse directed at him during the war"" (262). Compounding the problems Bragg's legacy would face were his mixed war record and his tendency to find it easier ""to reconcile with his former war enemies than with his Confederate colleagues"" (256). </p><p>Bragg's reputation is not apt to suddenly undergo a Renaissance -- 150 years of entrenched preconceptions is too much for any one book to overcome -- but Hess's sympathetic but balanced reassessment should give readers ample reason to reconsider any long-held assumptions and prejudices. In his prologue, Hess suggested that he wanted to craft a study that would transform Bragg ""from a cardboard figure into a real person with admirable personal qualities as well as distressing personal faults"" (xii). <i>Braxton Bragg</i> succeeds in recasting ""the most hated man in the Confederacy"" into one of the most interesting. </p><p><i>Chris Mackowski, Ph.D., is a professor of journalism and mass communication at St. Bonaventure University.

6501	9780807164570	$27.50	Stepdaughters of History: Southern Women and the American Civil War		Clinton, Catherine			"From Periphery to Center: Southern Women and the American Civil War<p>This concise volume marks the publication of three lectures that Catherine Clinton delivered at Louisiana State University in 2012 as the honored Walter Lynwood Fleming lecturer in Southern history.  The Fleming lectures have been a venerable LSU tradition for nearly eighty years, and in that time, only a handful of female historians have been invited to contribute.  Fittingly, then, Clinton's three lectures-turned-essays focus on the history and historiography of southern women in the Civil War era.</p><p>Despite its slim size, this volume packs an outsized punch.  It is a tour de force for Clinton, an exposition of her vast and deep knowledge of the field in which she has worked -- and written or edited nearly thirty books -- throughout her distinguished career.   The lectures and resulting book are part of her larger project to move women from the footnotes and sidebars of Civil War history and into the center of the narrative -- a place where they clearly saw themselves.  ""I believe in taking every opportunity to afford women a platform, a place at the table,"" she writes in the introduction, ""even when we don't like the menu."" (xvii)</p><p>Clinton's first chapter examines white Confederate women and their Civil War experiences, a relatively virgin terrain when Clinton began her career.  Historians have trafficked the field with gusto during the past two decades and Clinton highlights their valuable contributions.  She is just as intent, however, on showing how able Confederate women themselves, who constituted a veritable ""sisterhood of scribblers"" after the war, were at shaping and re-shaping the Confederate experience for hungry readers.   She credits this ""dethroned plantation royalty,"" the likes of LaSalle Pickett and, most famously, Mary Boykin Chestnut, among others with ""erect[ing] a barricade, a façade, incorporating remembrances of things imagined,"" which largely came to dominate the national reading of the war for decades. (2)</p><p>In chapter two, Clinton turns away from the elite women who were meant to emblemize southern societal expectations to those women who either chose or were forced to transgress them.  Her starting point is Loreta Janeta Valazquez, the Cuban-born, Louisiana-raised woman who, after the death of her husband and children, donned male clothing and took up arms as Confederate Lt. Henry Burford in 1861.   Clinton argues convincingly that Valazquez's experience may have been unusual, but it certainly was not singular.  Hundreds of southern women engaged in transgressive acts including cross-dressing, spying, smuggling and other gender-bending acts in service of the Confederacy.  Acknowledging both the problems and the promises of fragmentary evidence of these women, she insists that whatever we may think of their cause and motivations, that ""these spirited patriots require interrogation."" (74)</p><p>Clinton centers her final chapter, ""Mammy By Any Other Name,"" on that highly problematic archetypical southern figure that has historically rendered black women ""disembodied and anonymous."" (76)  She lays out in example after despairing example how, despite the bold and important contributions of black women as well as those of the the historians who study them, the mythology of Mammy continues to subsume the historical identity of southern African American women.  This problem appeared in all-too-bold relief when, during a recent discussion of who might Alexander Hamilton on the ten-dollar bill, one scholar vetoed Harriet Tubman, claiming that ""the American people might not be prepared to accept a 'Mammy' image on [their] money.""(77)  Clinton remains hopeful, however, that the cultural tide is turning thanks to modern historiography, and most importantly, social efforts such as the #SayHerName initiative.  ""Mammy may seem to have nine lives,"" she quips, ""but hopefully at least eight of them are gone."" (110) </p> <p><i>Stepdaughters of History</i> highlights the many stories southern women left of their Civil War experiences, as well as their narratives were variously embraced, discounted, buried, or eventually debunked.   The book serves as a bold and breezy appreciation of all of the important work that historians have done in the field to reveal and interpret southern women's experiences, and as a call for them to do more.   Clinton blends her historiographical and historical terrain seamlessly, and her piercing and witty prose is imminently readable, making this book essential reading both for people who have read much southern women's history and for those who have read none.</p> <p><i>Anne Marshall is an Associate Professor of History at Mississippi State University.</i></p>"	Marshall, Anne	Summer 2017	2017-8-1	Review			LSU Press		Antebellum;Reconstruction;Social_History;women			"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=249 alt=\""Product Cover\"" border=0 src=\""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/stepdaughterswr.jpg\"">"

Reading the thoughts of this passionate, pious, dedicated Quaker -- abolitionist, minister, and woman's rights and peace advocate -- causes one to reflect on the many American reformers in our past who worked to uplift our nation. Quakers like Mott were often at the forefront of those efforts. </p><p>Four eminent scholars have edited this collection of some sixty representative selections of Mott's words. They have chosen a balanced range of her stirring speeches and sermons, offering insights into the several causes she fought for, including some new material not found in previous publications. All of Mott's addresses were extemporaneous. Like fellow-abolitionist and woman's rights advocate Lucy Stone, she spoke from the heart, using no notes. Her speeches were either paraphrased by journalists and co-workers or recorded word-for-word by stenographers.</p><p>Reform was basic to Mott's very being, and for over sixty years her voice never stilled, continuing to lecture until months before she died. In all these selections, one senses both her calm demeanor and her ardent commitment in promoting various causes. Though diminutive in stature and feminine to the core, she was blisteringly effective with words. In addition to anti-slavery and women's rights, Mott advocated temperance, prison reform, the rights of Native Americans, and opposition to the death penalty. As one of the most famous women of her day, she spoke at Quaker meetings and in large, public halls. Many in her audiences agreed with every word she uttered; others hissed and jeered at her radical ideas, offended, too, by a woman speaking on a public stage. </p> <p>Faith was at the heart of her words and actions. Evident here is a woman who knew the Bible well, frequently citing scripture to argue her points. But Mott judiciously selected its truths, insisting that the Bible could be used most effectively by reflecting current times rather than some of the outmoded ideas from the time when it was written. For instance, she insisted that a perverted understanding of the scriptures and the influence of the church were in part responsible for women's oppression. She quoted passages that celebrated and honored women. </p><p>Mott understood the perpetuation of slavery better than many Americans, then and now, blaming not only southerners but northerners as well--manufacturers, financiers, and consumers -- who shared responsibility for the vile institution. Northerners ""ought not to use the products of slaves' unrequited toil,"" she maintained, for in doing so, they were promulgating slavery's existence. (142) </p><p>Mott was very much a part of history, in both her speeches and actions. She was a peace advocate and a critic of Abraham Lincoln and of the Civil War. She urged her own country as well as all nations to adopt an anti-war stance, insisting that arbitration and the spoken word, rather than the sword, could resolve global problems. She worked for equal pay and celebrated the opportunities gradually opening to women, including Philadelphia's women's medical college, the city's design school, and various professions formerly closed to women. She was present at the founding of the American Anti-Slavery Society in 1833; among eight women excluded from London's 1840 World Anti-Slavery Convention; one of five women who, in 1848, organized the Seneca Falls Woman's Rights Convention; a major presence and speaker at many women's suffrage conventions, and a founder of Swarthmore College in 1864. Like a number of abolitionists, she remained an active member of the American Anti-Slavery Society after the Civil War, urging the nation and the federal government to counter southern whites' cruelty against former slaves.</p> <p>As a Quaker, Mott sensed an inner light in every human being, insisted on racial and gender equality, and rejected racist sentiments, such as those expressed by her friend, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who opposed the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. To Mott, life should be lived simply but purposefully.  She set high standards for women, decrying those who embraced the latest fashions, thus becoming ""frivolous"" appendages of society. Mott continually encouraged women to be combative, to demand their rights rather than wait for them to be granted. She believed woman was man's equal, but having been ""so long crushed,"" she was too often ""enervated, paralyzed, prostrated by the influences by which she has been surrounded."" (111) Frustrating to her were the many women who saw no need to fight for their rights. ""So circumscribed have been her limits, that she does not realize the misery of her condition,"" she argued in one of her most-often quoted insights. (112) Women deserved access to education and to all the opportunities and rights that men enjoyed, including equal pay. </p><p>In a final public utterance, as she did so often throughout her life, she offered wisdom and inspiration. ""I want that we may all show our faith by our works, by our honesty and justice and mercy and love."" Would that everyone today could live by that thought and profit from her wisdom. </p><p><i>Sally G. McMillen, Professor Emeritus, Department of History, Davidson College.

6504	9780870624407	$32.95	Soldiering in the Shadow of Wounded Knee: The 1891 Diary of Private Hartford G. Clark, Sixth U.S. Cavalry		Clark, Hartford G.	Ed. Greene, Jerome		"Garrison Scenes: The Diary of Hartford G. Clark<p><i>Soldiering in the Shadow of Wounded Knee</i> is the edited diary of Private Hartford G. Clark, 6th U.S. Cavalry. The diary begins in January 1891 and ends in December. Essentially, it is a transcription of a transcription. In 1962, National Park Service historian Don Rickey, Jr. contacted Clark's widow, Pearl, who allowed him to transcribe her husband's diary, which he did by hand and typewriter. Four years later, Pearl Clark died and the original diary has since been lost; however, Rickey's transcriptions remained and Editor Jerome Greene has used them to complete <i>Soldiering in the Shadow of Wounded Knee</i>.</p> <p>Private Clark's diary entries annotate each day of the year. While some are short, single-sentence entries, most of them are meaty, detailed descriptions of life on the Nebraska frontier. The chapters are broken by month and are easy to read. Only one month is missing. The February entries never made it to Rickey for copying, so Editor Greene has included a five-page chapter, describing the known movements of Private Clark during this period.</p><p>Although born in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1869, Private Clark considered himself a New Englander. His family had moved to South Carolina during the Civil War to set up a retail business. In 1878, the Clarks moved back to Exeter, New Hampshire, where young Hartford completed his schooling. In the summer of 1890, at age twenty-one, he enlisted in the U.S. cavalry for a five-year term of service. He was assigned to Troop G, 6th U.S. Cavalry, a unit recently redeployed to South Dakota to deal with the Ghost Dance uprising. Clark's company arrived too late to participate in the Battle of Wounded Knee Creek, but Clark was witness to its grisly aftermath. His January 12, 1891, entry read: ""There lay in death the old and young of both sexes that were not [yet] buried, also about seventy-five dead horses and ponies."" (34)</p><p>Still, readers should be advised that <i>Soldiering in the Shadow of Wounded Knee</i> has little to do with the Battle of Wounded Knee itself, a veritable massacre that left as many as 200 Sioux dead on the field. After Clark left the battlefield, he did not think about it again. Mostly, Private Clark's diary describes his hum-drum life inside and around Fort Niobrara, a 470-person army outpost in northern Nebraska, immediately south of the Sioux reservations and 130 miles from the scene of the December 29 massacre. The diary, then, is not an action-packed account of U.S. cavalry operations. Instead, it is a catalogue of the day-to-day activities within one of the U.S. cavalry's many far-flung frontier outposts.</p> <p>But let it not be said that <i>Soldiering in the Shadow of Wounded Knee</i> is without excitement. In fact, the year-long diary is chock-full of colorful stories about life at the fort, both depressing and uplifting. Crime, vice, and violence marked Clark's year. During the winter months, boredom and melancholy caused by the foul, freezing weather set the soldiers on edge. Even the mild-mannered Clark became involved in a brawl with a surly, drunken soldier over a game of pool. Even in the vast prairie, the troopers at Fort Niobrara had easy access to the sins of civilization, and throughout the diary, they are seen drinking, swearing, fighting, or womanizing. In September, one trooper -- Trumpeter Clinton Dixon -- murdered Corporal John R. Carter when they fought over a local courtesan, Lillian ""Offie"" Lewis, sparking something of a scandalous murder trial that was well-remembered by local Nebraskans.</p> <p>At various points, Clark experienced wholesome activities. He participated in friendly horse races and he played on the fort's excellent baseball team. Further, his diary described his deep relationships. Much of his diary is devoted to his courtship of a young lady, Sarah Marshall, who lived in the nearby village of Valentine. Clark also developed a heart-warming connection with his horse, Nooney, and a friendship with a Brulé (a branch of the Lakota) named Yellow Hand who served with Company L, 6th U.S. Cavalry, one of the first units to enlist Indian men as regular cavalry (as opposed to scouts).</p><p>Clark's diary is generally devoid of broad opinions about his unit's mission, and rarely did he offer thoughts about the success of Indian pacification. However, after Wounded Knee, Clark offered this tantalizing assessment. He became enraged by a newspaper article that described the battle as a massacre. That was not the way he saw it. He wrote, ""What do they [in the East] know about what the Indians do . . . [?] Comparatively nothing. If they were out in this part of the country, and see the deeds done by them (Indians) while on the warpath, it would make them wish they were back among the more civilized class in the East."" (36) The lack of military campaigning, the recruitment of Indians into the Army, and his friendship with Yellow Hand probably changed Clark's opinion of his unit's mission, but we are left to guess how. Editor Greene speculates: ""In the broadest sense, neither Clark nor his compatriots at the time likely fathomed that the era of the Indian campaigns had passed before them."" (16) In short, Clark's diary describes the culmination of U.S. policy against the Plains Indians, but Clark's service was not long or deep enough to understand its significance.</p><p><i>Soldiering in the Shadow of Wounded Knee</i> is a great book, copiously footnoted and expertly annotated. Editor Greene makes Private Clark's stories interesting and accessible. This book will likely appeal only to specialists, those particularly interested in the history of Fort Niobrara or the history of late nineteenth century cavalry operations. It is an excellent example showing how a U.S. soldier's garrison journal can be used, but the subject matter will capture the attention only of those already deeply interested in this narrow slice of U.S. military history.</p><p>Timothy J.

6629	9780807164358	$49.93	The Slaveholding Crisis: Fear of Insurrection and the Coming of the Civil War		Paulus, Carl Lawrence			"Governance by Fear: The Politics of Insurrection<p>Expanding on Matthew Clavin's <i>Toussaint Louverture and the American Civil War: the Promise and Peril of a Second American Revolution</i> (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2010), Carl L. Paulus's new book broadens the specter of servile insurrection in America, particularly in the slaveholding South.  Planters and intellectuals in the South such as Edmund Ruffin linked territorial expansion of slavery with the avoidance of slave uprising and feared that Republicans would force slaves to abandon masters and flock to Republican ""invaders"" (p. 3), laying the groundwork for another Santo Domingo.  Fear of black insurrection merged in the minds of these planters with the image of Republicans transforming northern states through insurrectionary slaves, and, with a sympathetic president from the North, refused to send troops and thereby encourage black rebels to burn down plantations and destroy the white racial hierarchy in the South across social spectrums.  Thomas Jefferson's longing for an empire of liberty <i>and</i> territorial expansion that enslaved millions of blacks required dependence upon non-slaveholders.  Even in the North, slavery in white South was at stake; therefore, whites across most of the South readily prepared for war rather than real or perceived abolitionism.</p> <p>This book explains the horrors for many contemporary white antebellum Americans.  It has surpassed the still useful <i>Crisis of Fear: Secession in South Carolina</i> (1970) by Steven Channing and incorporated the entire slaveholding South. Paulus both covered a series of atrocities by blacks and white alike in a book that reads like a civil war.  Louis Moreau Gottchalk, virtuoso pianist, worried about potential black savagery in New Orleans because of the proximity of nearby: St. Kitts, Haiti, and Cuba. He watched as the black population in the South grew steadily. More broadly, stories of the Haitian Revolution seldom subsided and at least undermined the thoughts of planters great or small. Gottchalk knew that whippings and whites' violence occurred often and were usually savage, and at any time or incident <i>could</i> rise up against whites.  Masters remained vigilant.  They had to when South Carolina and Virginia nearly outnumbered slaves in the 1790s. Benjamin Franklin created chaos in the House of Representatives when Congress petitioned to end the international slave trade. During that era, Americans feared that emancipation, or worse, insurrection, occurred, to the dismay of anti-slavery Quakers. Jeffersonian Republicans labored to distance themselves from the French Revolution and <i>universal</i> equality in their efforts to stop slave insurrection and that dangerous concept, the universal equality of the human race. Slave violence occurred at Point Coupee, Louisiana, in 1795 and plotted to attack local planters.  French slaveholders used torture against them with whippings, getting dragged and tied to death, and many more died by hanging.  Corpses were posted to strike fear into rebellious slaves.  Patrols were similar in Virginia and South Carolina.  Thomas Jefferson feared a slave uprising, as did men in Maryland and North Carolina.  White Virginians doubled the forces of their state militias and feared two hundred or more slaves ready to torture whites. From Pennsylvania, Albert Gallatin was troubled by the idea of slave rapine, pillage, and massacre.  During Gabriel's uprising in 1800 he walked the streets of Richmond and obtained iron tools in order to overthrow slavery in Virginia and plotted to kidnap Governor James Monroe.</p> <p>Paulus noted that Patrick Henry's ""give me liberty or give me death"" adage paralleled Gabriel's ""Liberté ou La Mort, "" from the French Caribbean's independence.  A harrowing dilemma spread across the nations' newspapers. Should publishers distribute newspapers that dealt with various aspects of slavery's horrors, lest they send violence and carnage into their minds?  This problem vexed the Phliadelpia <i>Gazette</i>. With or without newspapers, black rebels forced whites together from Massachusetts to Georgia to the point that many white Americans feared the destruction of democracy and the Union. For many, the idea of the death of the Union was at best precarious. When David Walker published his <i>Appeal to the Colored Citizens of the World</i> in Boston, a thousand miles south a planter used extra security and demanded censoring abolitionists. President Andrew Jackson ordered his Postmaster General, Amos Kendell, to block attempts to stir slaves rebelliousness by publishing incendiary ideas.</p>   <p>Time, of course, escalated the situation.  John Brown's antislavery fanaticism both in Kansas, and more so at Harper's Ferry, was stirred by the Haitian Revolution.  One of Brown's sons explained to correspondent to the <i>New York Times</i> that the body of Toussaint L'Ouverture slept in tombs, but his soul laid in the cabins of slaves, and the despots of America had to strike the first blow.  They found the right person.  John Brown took his war in 1859 and aimed to free the slaves across the nation in a bungled effort. However, he renewed the Haitian Revolution that was backed, among others, by the abolitionists who called themselves the Secret Six, although they did make a martyr of Brown and bolstered abolition.  Brown's execution was received as either heroic and despotic depending not only blacks and whites. Abraham Lincoln became the commander-in-chief in 1861 and risked civil war.  Slaveholders no longer wished to witness more conflicts over slavery. So did Lincoln. Virginian Edmund Ruffin took it upon himself to leave his beloved Virginia and head to South Carolina and a standoff between what would result in the Union and the Confederacy. Early on the day of April 12, 1861, the very radical Ruffin and others at Fort Sumter heard a tremendous explosion: the warning shot at union vessels. Ruffin took credit for firing the first shot at Sumter and Union Major Robert Anderson. Carl Paulus' richly rewarding book reminds that warfare, and those who engage in it, have always been in the eyes of beholders.</p> <p><i>Eric H.

6450	9780820350028	$29.95	The Ghosts of Guerrilla Memory: How Civil War Bushwhackers Became Gunslingers in the American West		Hulbert, Matthew C.			"Heroes from Another Land: Confederate Guerrillas and the making of the Wild West<p>Few events in American history generate as much popular interest and stir up as many conflicting memories as the Civil War and the Wild West. Both produced battles, heroes, villains, victims, drama, and controversy that left lasting imprints on American culture. Dominant narratives abound in both. Civil War accounts center on the famous leaders and battles in Virginia, Tennessee, and Georgia and foster collective memories anchored on the Lost Cause, emancipation, and the restoration of the Union. In the West, the inexorable march of civilization -- punctuated by tales of railroads, cattle, miners, bison, Indians, outlaws, gamblers, and lawmen -- ushers in end of the frontier as a dynamic catalyst for the development of American values. In <i>The Ghosts of Guerrilla Memory</i>, Matthew C. Hulbert skillfully uses memoirs, contemporary histories, Hollywood movies, and numerous primary sources to take some of the key figures from one of the unruly fringes of the Civil War -- the ugly partisan bloodletting in Missouri and Kansas -- and link their collective memories to the legendary outlaw myths of the Wild West.</p>  	<p>At the epicenter of this fascinating process is Confederate guerrilla chief William Clark Quantrill, the Ohio-born architect of the 1863 raid on Lawrence, Kansas and one of the crucial figures in the construction of the border war's checkered legacy. Like many of his fellow guerrilla leaders, Quantrill did not survive the conflict, leaving it to his followers, enemies, victims, apologists, and a myriad of historians to sort out the truth about his life, death, and significance to the history and memory of the war. The first in this long line of chroniclers was former Confederate John Newman Edwards, whose 1877 tome <i>Noted Guerrillas, or Warfare on the Border</i> attempted to incorporate Quantrill and the conflict in Missouri into the larger framework of the Lost Cause. While his portrayal of the guerrilla leader as a stone-cold killer was awash in hyperbole, his justification for the band's unfettered violence as self-defense against malevolent Kansas ""Jayhawkers"" was pure Lost Cause rhetoric. The motive behind this effort was mostly practical, as it served to place Missouri and its partisans into a unique sub-section of the Confederate war narrative, which in turn provided an ideological basis for the maintenance of White supremacy and Jim Crow.</p>	<p>In the wake of Edwards' influential work, the surviving partisans reinforced their own Confederate identities by holding reunions at various locations near the scenes of action. What began as a meeting between a handful of Quantrill's former comrades and his mother Caroline in 1888, morphed into a more formal set of encampments held annually between 1898 and 1929. These gatherings strove to integrate the border raiders into the larger story of the South's perseverance in the face of a destructive war, oppressive Reconstruction policies, and ongoing racial dysfunction. They adopted many Lost Cause themes, including the need to protect women and children from aggressive Yankees (both black and white), and attempted to fit in with the more respectable United Confederate Veterans. In this context, the raid on Lawrence became a retaliation for the deaths of southern women at the hands of their Union captors and thus a justifiable act of war. However, even as Quantrill's men attempted to join the mainstream Confederate veterans in their commemorative activities, dissenting voices appeared that pushed the guerrilla image in a new direction.</p>	<p>Not surprisingly, the first level of disagreement came from the former Unionists in nearby Kansas, who took issue with the idea that the vandals who pillaged Lawrence were somehow honorable soldiers. In 1909, William E. Connelley, ""an avid chronicler of the Missouri-Kansas border war"" wrote what he claimed would be a ""serious study"" (145) of those violent days in <i>Quantrill and the Border Wars</i>.  His version describes Quantrill as a psychopath whose grotesquely violent tendencies were rooted in his flawed character and manifested during the border conflict. The heart of his narrative was the raid on Lawrence, where vivid accounts by survivors highlighted the brutality of the raiders towards the town's peaceful citizens. This hatchet job on Quantrill's image corresponded with efforts by the citizens of Lawrence to denounce the former raiders who still boldly held reunions just across the border. Other counter-jabs at the Edwards/Lost Cause version of Quantrill's life and career included a satirical 1875 play entitled ""Quantrill the Queer,"" an epic poem glorifying Jayhawker and arch-enemy Jim Lane, and a series of vivid (and often contradictory) eyewitness accounts describing the violent fate of the only raider killed during the Lawrence Raid.</p>  	<p>The other challenge to the heroic Quantrill myth ironically came from the movement's own female contingent. One of the singular characteristics of the border war was the direct inclusion of families and homesteads as spies, runners, supply depots, hideouts, hospitals, and sources of moral support. The fluid nature of guerrilla warfare eliminated the safe rear areas common to a traditional military conflict and rendered the term ""non-combatant"" rather meaningless. Both sides accused the other of vulgarity, brutality, sexual assault, and the outright murder of women, children, and the elderly; both claimed that the right of retaliation justified continued violence. In a weird case of role reversal, guerrilla women often protected their men rather than the other way around. Tales of fierce women defending hearth and home from predatory Yankees dominated several published accounts and served to undermine the manhood of their oft-absent menfolk. Fitting the borderland fighters into the mainstream narrative proved difficult and ultimately unproductive, which led to another avenue for the construction (or de-construction) of guerrilla memory.</p>	<p>The second half of Hulbert's study focusses on how ""Missouri's bushwhackers were culled from the Civil War borderlands, stripped of their Confederate context, and conflated with other western figures"" (183) via dime novels and other forms of popular literature. With the James and the Younger brothers serving as key figures, this contingent of former raiders were folded in with characters like Billy the Kid to provide fodder for a sensationalized, mostly fictional construction of western outlaw tropes. Although there had been real shootouts, bank heists, and train robberies (notably the James/Younger gang's disastrous 1876 Northfield, Minnesota raid), by the time Jessie James and Billy the Kid were gunned down in the early 1880s, many of the conditions that had existed during their heyday were already in decline. The diminution of the real west did not inhibit the creation of a dynamic ""Wild West"" in the minds of the dime novelists and the reading public. Before and after their deaths, James and The Kid were featured in farfetched exploits ranging from Mexico to the Yukon, fighting Comanche's, Mexican bandits, Texas Rangers, and all manner of ruffians. They rescued maidens, married and fathered children, and alternated ranching and homesteading with their ""thrilling adventures."" For James in particular, this fanciful life as a roving outlaw all but obliterated memories of his early career as a Civil War guerrilla. He became almost interchangeable with the much younger Billy the Kid as an icon of the west rather than one associated with the late war.</p>  	<p>By the early 20th century several of the remaining guerillas feebly endeavored to cash in on their western fame. Some wrote memoirs or gave speeches, and upon their release from jail, Frank James and Cole Younger attempted to create a Wild West show using the model provided by Buffalo Bill's successful venture. Unlike the more famous version, the Younger-James experiment was a failure, punctuated by accidents, ineptness, and allegations of embezzlement and fraud against the former outlaws. The final evidence of this metamorphosis from wartime to western imagery is shown in films, beginning with 1940s westerns that reflected the dime novel approach to storytelling. Quantrill makes an occasional appearance as a villain and the Civil War gets passing mention, but most of the plots focus on the reluctant and morally torn hero making choices between loyalty to the outlaw band, love for a woman (sometimes portrayed as the wife or sister of Quantrill), or duty to cause or community. While mostly Hollywood hokum, these films represent the ambiguous role that the Civil War played in defining western heroes and villains. Among more modern treatments, the Clint Eastwood classic, <i>The Outlaw Josey Wales</i> (1976) and Ang Lee's <i>Ride with the Devil</i> (1999) stand out as films that pay more than a passing attention to the complexities of the guerrilla war and its effect on the post-war west.</p>  	<p>During a final Tony Horwitz-like search for landmarks and graves associated with the guerrilla fighters, the author discovers that not everyone agrees that the legacy of these characters is worth remembering, which in turn threatens the preservation and interpretation of these sites.

6563	9780820351124	$69.95	Homicide Justified: The Legality of Killing Slaves in the United States and the Atlantic World		Fede, Andrew T.			"Homicide: A Matter of Law and Practice	<p>In his book, <i>Homicide Justified</i>, Andrew Fede compares slave homicide laws in the slave societies of ancient Rome, the colonial West Indies, British North America, and the United States. Fede, a law partner in a New Jersey firm and an adjunct professor of law at Montclair State University, has written two other books on slavery in the southern United States. Homicide is the broad overarching term used to denote the taking of a human life. Murder is a specific kind of homicide that indicates the killing was premeditated, intentional, and malicious. Not every homicide is illegal and, in fact, may be permissible as in the case of self-defense and even required as in the case of blood vengeance or blood feud. Fede asserts there is no consensus among scholars as to what a master's liability was for slave homicide. Using the southern United States as his primary model, he notes that Ulrich B. Phillips declared whites that killed slaves were treated the same as if they had killed another white person while Kenneth Stamp and Stanley Elkins argued the law legitimized slave killing, especially when masters did the killing. Fede uses a law in the books and a law in action approach to show that for the southern slave states both assertions are correct.</p>	<p>Fede begins his study discussing slave homicide in the Roman Republic. As Judy Gaughan has proven, murder was not a crime in the Roman Republic, that is to say it was neither a public wrong nor a matter for the state. It was a private issue settled between families. In the case of a slave killing, a master sought damages under <i>Lex Aquilia</i> where property owners claimed compensation for the loss. Damages were assessed at the highest value during the prior year. Thus, in the Roman Republic murdering a slave was a tort or a private wrong rather than a crime. The exception to the rule was if the slayer was the master. Masters were free to treat and dispose of their property as they saw fit and could not be held liable if they killed their own slave. Things changed during the era of the Roman Empire as masters saw their once absolute rights incrementally restricted. An early law of the Empire prohibited masters from selling their slaves to fight wild beasts in the arena. Later the law forbade abandoning a slave who was ill and designated the crime as murder. Some later Emperors decreed that killing a slave was a crime unless the slayer had a good reason to do so.</p>	<p>The slave law of homicide in the Roman Empire became more fully developed during the reign of Constantine who issued an edict defining three classes of slave homicide. First, masters saw no punishment for accidental killings if the death occurred during an ordinary chastisement where there was no intent to kill. Second, masters could be held liable if they intentionally killed their slaves while punishing them. Third, masters could be held liable for killing their own slaves if the disciplinary method fell under one of the prohibited punishments listed in the ""gruesome catalogue"" of abuses. Laws restricting a master's right to kill his own slave were part of a larger effort to regulate property rights. These laws were designed to protect the slave owner's heirs. Unfortunately, Fede could not find enough cases pertaining to slave homicide to be able to draw concluded as to how the law in the books was put into action.</p>	<p>Visigoths were Germanic peoples whose kings ruled Spain from 415 to 711. Slavery reached its peak in Visigoth Spain in the sixth and seventh centuries and flourished in areas where the Roman Empire had collapsed. Visigoths were tribal and followed custom, which meant they used blood feud to avenge murder. Masters had an unlimited right to kill their slaves, as slaves were property and nothing more. Later Visigoth kings created law codes that were an amalgam of Roman law and German custom. Kings sought a monopoly on violence, but made exceptions legitimizing certain kinds of private violence. The law codes limited a master's right to kill a slave by requiring him to get a court order first. Visigoth law codes legalized slave killing in cases of self-defense or if death occurred in the course of punishment. If the killing was the product of malice, the master could be deprived of the right to testify in court, exiled for life, compelled to do penance, or deprived of his property, which would be transferred to his nearest heirs. If the killer was not the owner of the slave, then the master could seek compensation. Visigoth law influenced Spanish law generally, but it is not clear whether it had any effect on slave homicide law specifically.</p>	<p>The slave laws of Spain, Portugal, and France came to the Americas as part of conquest. Slavery was not common in Spain. It flourished mostly in urban centers and most slaves were female. In Castile, the <i>Partidas</i> defined three kinds of homicide: wrongful, justified, and accidental. If not done in self-defense, the killing of a slave was punished the same as killing a free person, which meant five years banishment. This Spanish law of slave homicide came to the Americas with the Spanish conquerors. In neighboring Portugal, the slave homicide laws were the same as Spain's and the Portuguese brought their slave laws to Brazil when they conquered that land. In Brazil it was a capital crime for anyone, including a master, to intentionally murder a slave. In March of 1685, King Louis XIV issued the <i>Code Noir</i>, the first slave code for the French Atlantic in the Americas. Article forty-three of the code authorized colonial officials to punish owners and overseers who murdered slaves, though killers could be absolved of punishment under certain circumstances such as slave insurrection or in the course of disciplining the slave. Fede says the <i>Code Noir</i> was implemented in New France, but there are not enough extant cases to be able to draw conclusions about how the slave law of homicide was deployed.</p>	<p>Despite the fact that there is no tradition of slavery in English common law, British settlers in the Atlantic islands and British North American mainland presumed it was acceptable to enslave natives and Africans. Gradually, an imperial law of slavery developed as local assemblies adopted and adapted slave laws from Spain and Portugal. Judges then developed a common law of slavery. Laws pertaining to slave homicide, however, were not taken from Iberian law, but rather were developed locally. The Barbadian legislature enacted the first slave code in 1661, and it quickly spread throughout the British Atlantic island colonies. After 1750, the Barbadian slave code made its way to the British colonial mainland. Clause twenty of the Barbadian law gave masters the right to kill a slave who had run away or misbehaved. Killing a slave for any other reason could be punished with a fine. If a third party murdered a slave, he had to pay double to slave's value, but if the killing was accidental, the master determined the compensation. Barbadian slaves did not possess the right of self-defense, except to defend their masters. Scholars commonly presume the mainland British colonies adopted the Barbadian slave code wholesale, but Fede found that only South Carolina adopted the homicide part of the code. The other colonies incorporated slave killings into the common law of homicide. In theory, killing a slave was equal to killing a free person and would be punished as such. That means a master would be executed for the intentional killing of his slave. In practice, Fede found that the exceptions swallowed the rule. Murders of slaves that occurred in the course of discipline, insurrection, and self-defense were readily accepted and master acquitted for the killings. Few white men were executed for the killing of a slave in the North American British Empire. </p>	<p>After independence, states attempted slave law reform, including the homicide laws. The tendency was to equate the murder of a slave with the murder of a free white man, but the practice allowed for so many exceptions that only a few masters were executed for killing their own slaves. Almost all of these men were outcasts in their own communities. Virginia, South Carolina, and Texas each executed one master. Tennessee executed two men who were not masters. As the nation expanded westward, the slave homicide laws of the new states were like those of the old. American slave law proclaimed in the books that slaves were entitled to the same protections as whites, but in practice the law operated to serve the master's economic interests. <i>Homicide Justified</i> gives us a comprehensive examination of the law of slave homicide from ancient times to the abolition of slavery in the United States. </p><p>Mary R.

6500	9780807166024	$45.00	Remembering Reconstruction:  Struggles Over the Meaning of America's Most Turbulent Era		Ed. Emberton, Carole	Ed. Baker, Bruce E		"How and Why Americans Remember Reconstruction -- and Why They May be Forgetting It	<p>Civil War memory continues to generate public debates, most often over the Confederate flag and Confederate monuments.  It has also long attracted the attention of historians who have published a seemingly endless stream of studies on the topic.  The construction of the memory of Reconstruction, ""one of the major American cultural projects of the late nineteenth and first half of the twentieth centuries"" (8) as W. Fitzhugh Brundage puts in his introduction to this book, has received strikingly less scholarly attention.   <i>Remembering Reconstruction</i> offers a welcome and important corrective.  Its editors, Carole Emberton and Bruce E. Baker, bring together ten essays that discuss varied topics and time periods, but together address four important themes.</p>	<p>First, several of the essays trace the development of the traditional image of Reconstruction and its use by white southerners.  K. Stephen Prince argues that in 1890 the North had not yet lost interest in racial change in the South or embraced the South's view of Reconstruction.  Over the next two decades ""white supremacists used the memory of Reconstruction as a bludgeon -- a blunt rhetorical tool that worked best through sheer repetition"" (19).  The memory they promoted included a myth of Negro domination, the idea that unprepared and uncivilized African Americans dominated and corrupted the South, but ""it was also about northern control of the South"" (18), what might be called the myth of Carpetbag rule.  It was that aspect of memory, Prince rightly points out, that ""presented a powerful argument against further federal interventionism"" (23).</p> <p>In another essay on the 1890s, Mark Elliott analyzes what he considers a critical moment in the development of the white supremacist memory of Reconstruction, meetings at the Mohonk Conference, usually devoted to Indian affairs, which in 1890 and 1891 focused on the ""Negro Problem.""   The conferences ""downplayed the importance of black political rights, lamented the mistakes of Reconstruction, and accommodated proslavery ideology.""  As a result, he concludes, ""Republicans in Washington"" received ""little encouragement to undertake a renewed intervention in the South"" (160).  In an essay on the late 1930s through the 1960s, Jason Morgan Ward further develops the idea that white southerners employed the memory of Reconstruction to prevent federal intervention in southern race relations.</p>	<p>In a survey of the treatment of the Ku Klux Klan in United States history textbooks, and one of the best essays in the collection, Elaine Parsons also explores the construction of the memory of Reconstruction.  She finds interest in the KKK rose in the 1880s, declined in the 1890s, then rose again after 1905.  Like Prince, she argues that texts' treatment of the Klan as a necessary response to black political power owed much to pressure by organized white southerners.  But her account suggests that white northerners did not have to be bludgeoned; they played a role in creating a white supremacist memory.  Elliot agrees, saying that ""Northerners were complicit in allowing the mythology about the 'horrors of Reconstruction' to flourish"" (139).   Parsons, though, goes further.  She perceptively observes that the Klan came to ""stand for all white-on-black violence, allowing the reader to believe that such violence had geographic and social limits, a beginning, and, most comfortingly, an end"" (226).   It naturalized and romanticized white racism, ""displaced it temporarily as well as spatially from"" the readers' ""own lives,"" and rendered it ""unrelated to more proximate claims of oppression that might require political response"" (225).</p>	<p>The memory that whites constructed did not go unchallenged, however.  African Americans developed their own narrative of Reconstruction, a second theme of the collection.  Shawn Leigh Alexander analyses how African American journalist T. Thomas Fortune used his memories of Reconstruction and those of others who lived through it ""to stress the violence of Reconstruction while demonstrating the resilience of the black community"" (62).   In an excellent essay on John R. Lynch, Justin Behrend shows that his history, <i>The Facts of Reconstruction</i>, also rested on his personal experience.  In it, however, Lynch did not stress racial violence or the era's intense political struggles.  Instead, he attacked the myth of Negro domination and stressed that Reconstruction brought democracy to the South.  Along with elite accounts such as Lynch's, Carole Emberton argues in an intriguing examination of the slave narratives the Federal Writers Project collected in the 1930s, a very different vernacular memory of the era persisted among African Americans.  What she terms ""the 'being good' mentality"" (124) developed in the midst of ""deprivation and fear"" (119) during the years after the war.  It was rooted in the freed peoples' appreciation of the fact that local whites still maintained power but nevertheless allowed them ""a semblance of control over their own lives"" (124).  In the 1930s interviews, former slaves told stories that focused on ""misguided attempts to reform the postwar South, all seasoned with declarations of love for their downtrodden former masters, disdain for impotent 'Yankees,' and sharp criticism for 'biggity' freedpeople"" (111).  These three essays at once reveal the power of whites to influence how blacks portrayed Reconstruction but just as surely demonstrate the persistence of a distinctive African American memory of it.  The essays thereby complicate an understanding of the rise of the dominant memory.  If the white South's views did not go unchallenged, then northerners clearly chose to accept it, which reaffirms the case for their complicity.</p>	<p>Although still addressing issues of racism, three other essays place the memory of Reconstruction in an international context, the third and perhaps newest theme of the book.   Elliott's essay argues that the myth of Negro domination influenced the new American empire created after the Spanish-American War, which was built upon ""the presumption that an extended, open-ended period of white tutelage had to precede self-government"" (166).  Natalie J. Ring describes what she terms a ""New Reconstruction"" (174), in which turn-of-the century Progressives sought to address the serious problems in the South through ""the use of the regulatory state and guided by social scientific theory"" (178).   Treating the first Reconstruction as a failure, these reformers distanced their efforts from it by ""drawing comparisons between the region and overseas colonies of other countries"" and then framing their efforts at ""southern readjustment, both implicitly and explicitly, in the context of colonialism and transnational reform"" (183).  Looking at a slightly later period, Samuel L. Schaffer argues that Woodrow Wilson's memory of the South's experience after the Civil War influenced his search in World War I for a just, non-punitive peace as well as his support for the postwar colonial mandate system.  Wilson had concluded that Reconstruction showed that ""dark-skinned peoples untrained in freedom could not be left on their own"" (215).   Both Schaffer and Ring acknowledge that their subjects rarely mentioned Reconstruction, a silence that raises questions about how direct and important an influence its memory was.  And putting Reconstruction in an international context raises an even more interesting question.  Imperialism seemed to be most influenced by a version of the myth of Negro domination; the lesson drawn from Reconstruction was that whites needed to exercise control.  Yet Americans, southerners in particular, could easily have compared colonialism to another theme of the memory of Reconstruction, northern control of the South.  Why did the memory of Reconstruction not lead more Americans to condemn colonialism as another attempt at Carpetbag rule?</p>  	<p>Only one of the essays directly addresses the book's fourth theme, one Brundage describes as ""the erosion of the power of Reconstruction memory to mobilize Americans"" (10).  Bruce Baker finds that during the 1970 South Carolina Sesquicentennial local historical celebrations, with a few exceptions, ignored Reconstruction, in large measure because race relations at the time were better than ever before or since.  Other authors, however, touch on the diminished public interest in Reconstruction.  Ward argues that in the post-World War II years use of Reconstruction memory continued but its political impact diminished.  And Parsons shows that in textbooks the old stories of the Klan had been excised, although romantic echoes remained.</p>  	<p>In developing all four themes, <i>Remembering Reconstruction</i> makes a major contribution.  Perhaps the fact that Reconstruction no longer has the emotive powers it once had helps explain why historians have devoted so much more attention to Civil War memory, over which disputes continue.    Why does the Civil War command greater public interest than Reconstruction?  It may be, in part, because there are so many physical reminders of the war--monuments and the Confederate flag--that evoke such passions.   Reconstruction has left far fewer artifacts over which to fight.  But the nature and function of the memory of Reconstruction may play a role as well.  Opposition to the federal government certainly has become stronger in recent years, but with national conservative opposition to it and southern Republican influence in Washington, it is hard to see the relevance of the myth of Carpetbag rule.  And the myth of Negro domination may be too explicitly racist for modern sensibilities.  Defending Confederate symbols may allow an assertion of white identity without, as Parson puts it about the Klan, ""confronting an enduring problem that demanded political response.""</p><p><i>Gaines M.

There was no central bank and no national currency, but rather a mostly decentralized system of banks of varying sorts that circulated thousands of different paper banknotes throughout the country. Counterfeiting was widespread, banknote values fluctuated wildly and varied from place to place, and chains of credit and debt created through promissory notes and bills of exchange easily became byzantine. Fundamental instability was endemic to the economy, and only the exigencies of the war itself led policymakers to craft an economic order that began to resemble that of the modern world.</p> <p>Anyone who has ever tried to convey the complexity of these circumstances in a survey lecture knows the looks of befuddlement and boredom on the faces of undergraduates, and when pressed more than a few historians would surely admit that they do not entirely understand how the economy worked in the early republic either. But banking and finance were crucial to the development of the United States, and they shaped the lives, fortunes, and politics of millions of people, which makes Sharon Murphy's <i>Other People's Money</i> a very welcome contribution. Part of a series from Johns Hopkins University Press designed to explain ""how things worked"" in American history, <i>Other People's Money</i> traces the evolution of the American financial system in a fairly clear and straightforward manner from the age of the American Revolution through the aftermath of the Civil War. In so doing, it provides a historical and mechanical primer that experts in the field may not need but that anyone ranging from undergraduates to scholars with limited economic literacy will find invaluable.</p><p>Befitting a work designed to explain the basics, Murphy begins in the era of European exploration, laying out elemental components of a barter economy, the emergence of merchants and of money as a stable store of value, the significance of specie and of fiat currency, and the mechanics of inflation and deflation. A quick tour of the financing of the Revolutionary War, the economic chaos that followed it and that helped create the need for the Constitution, and the financial plans of Alexander Hamilton leads directly into a discussion of early banks.</p> <p>For all that the Constitution helped provide some economic authority to a central government that could act on behalf of the entire nation, Murphy observes that federalism and constitutional ambiguity set the stage for financial bedlam in the early republic. Under the Constitution, the federal government could issue specie but had no explicit power to charter a bank, while states could charter corporations but had no power to issue money of any kind. In the event, Congress used the elastic clause of the Constitution to charter a National Bank that held federal funds, states issued charters for banks that printed money, and within the space of two generations Americans had created a sprawling patchwork system of banks and currency. On one hand, that system expanded the money supply, facilitated all sorts of economic transactions, and enabled the financing of internal improvements and western expansion. On the other hand, frauds and failures were not uncommon, it was challenging and sometimes impossible to sort good money from bad, and both the outsized influence and the very idea of a national bank were controversial.</p><p>Financial panics hardly instilled public confidence in banks. Even as Murphy delineates the various structural and global factors that contributed to contractive meltdowns such as the Panic of 1819, she acknowledges that the difficulties of knowing whether bank loans were sound or speculative, bankers honest or corrupt, and investments safe or insecure yielded an environment where distrust was easy to come by and predictability hard to find, making panics in some measure ""a self-fulfilling prophecy"" (p. 78). Following the disaster of 1819, some states instituted reforms designed to prevent the recurrence of such events, and the Second National Bank under the directorship of Nicholas Biddle did institute something resembling real regulatory control of the banking system. But many Americans remained deeply skeptical of banks regardless. Those skeptics found a champion in President Andrew Jackson, who achieved his personal mission of destroying the Second National Bank at the expense of the stability that institution provided.</p> <p>The result was the Panic of 1837, and the banking system became more disorganized in its wake than it had ever been before. No one would deny the significance of the demise of the Second National Bank, but Murphy makes a strong case that we have underrated that significance and that it was central to the history of nineteenth-century America. In its absence, the national economy entered a multiyear freefall followed by stagnation that only truly lifted with the California gold rush. Moreover, the panic served as a turning point for experimentation in the banking system. Some states were so scarred by the panic that they simply banned banking altogether, but most looked for new banking models that could make claims to providing stability. This was the age of so-called free banking, which in an antimonopoly spirit allowed for general incorporation of banks (and for occasional outright frauds known as ""wildcat banks""). Some places saw the proliferation of savings banks that offered financial services to members of the working class, or of building and loan banks that worked especially for members of the middle class. It was in this era as well that investment banks started coming into play to facilitate sales of stocks and bonds for states and corporations alike. On the whole, even as there was significantly greater disarray in the banking and financial system after 1837, processes of diversification, sophistication, and modernization took place that paralleled and advanced those trends in the economy more broadly, and that pointed toward the financial expansion of the post-Civil War era.</p><p>Importantly, however, the post-1837 era was not an era of unregulated banking. Simultaneous to the spread of trends like free banking were more stringent government regulations of banks put in place to try and avoid yet another bust. Some states crafted strictly controlled public-private hybrid systems of banks. Others saw the institution of safety funds, bank inspections, banking commissions, higher reserve requirements, and check clearinghouses. The federal government turned to a variant of Martin Van Buren's Independent Treasury system that created subtreasuries throughout the country to hold federal money and that created deflationary pressures that somewhat contained unwise speculation. Business cycles could not be controlled altogether, but instituted reforms helped stave off total systemic collapse when the next downturn came in 1857.</p><p>Ultimately, it was the Civil War itself that truly transformed the American financial system. In the Confederacy, the course of the war and policy choices by Confederate officials proved disastrous for the banking system specifically and for the economy more generally. The Union, meanwhile, drew on some of the experiments of the antebellum era, but both bankers such as Jay Cooke and Treasury officials such as Salmon Chase made clear that extensive reform would be needed to sustain the bonds and greenbacks issued to fund the war effort. By the end of the war, the United States would have a uniform currency, state banknotes were set down a course toward disappearance, and a system of federally chartered and federally regulated banks came to exercise outsized sway over the national economy, though the United States would not have a true central bank until the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913.</p><p>One critique of Other People's Money might be that the narrative centers overwhelmingly on politics and the law at the expense of explaining the impact of the changing financial and banking system on American culture and especially on the lives of individual Americans. Thousands thrilled to eras of expansion, fretted that banks were little more than scams and gambling operations, suffered when economic bubbles burst, and raged for policymakers to exact revenge against the moneymen on their behalf. More of their voices would have enlivened a book that can sometimes be dry even as it is deeply informative. In addition, some greater attention to the significance of slavery in the development of the banking system would have been welcome. The subject is hardly absent, but it could have been integrated more thoroughly, particularly in light of the growing historiography on slavery's relationship to capitalism.</p><p>Nonetheless, Murphy has provided what should be the go-to source for anyone looking to understand the differences among savings banks, investment banks, and commercial banks in pre-Civil War America; to know what it meant for banks to provide discounts on commercial paper; and to know what terms like fractional reserve, independent treasury, bimetallism, shinplasters, wildcat banks, and bills of exchange meant. Oh, and if you are wondering how exactly Andrew Jackson ended up on the twenty-dollar bill, Murphy answers that too. Read the epilogue.</p><p><i>Joshua D.

6455	9781421421360	$32.95	Faces of the Civil War Navies: An Album of Union and Confederate Sailors		Coddington, Ronald S			"Humanizing the Fleet: A Look at the Men Who Crewed the Navy<p><i>Faces of the Civil War Navies: An Album of Union and Confederate Sailors</i> by Ronald S. Coddington offers an interesting insight into the lives of those who served at sea during the Civil War through the use of photographic portraits. The Civil War was the first war in American History to be seen through the cameras lens. Photographers followed armies providing images of camp life and battlefields. It is also the first war to show us the faces of those who fought. The invention of the <i>cartes de visite</i> in the 1850s made photographic portraits accessible to the common man, in a format that provided multiple prints from one sitting. These portraits are at the core of <i>Faces of the Civil War Navies</i>. This is Coddington's fourth volume to use Civil War portraits, having previously looked at the Union Army, Confederate Army, and African-Americans. The purpose remains the same, """" to humanize the Civil War through the stories and images of men in the ranks and officers and through their lives and military experiences in order to increase our understanding of the revolution that resulted in a new America free of slavery and rededicated to equality for all its citizens. "" (xviii).</p>  <p>The layout of <i>Faces of the Civil War Navies</i> is rather simple, yet very informative on both the subject and the medium. To truly understand these sailors, it is important to learn why these men volunteered for naval service. In the Forward, noted Naval Historian Craig L. Symonds describes the makeup of the Civil War Navy. As the Navy grew to meet wartime demands it needed new officers and sailors to crew the growing fleet. To fill the need for officers, the Navy turned to sources beyond Naval Academy graduates -- mostly volunteers from the merchant trade. As such the Navy, like the Army, had a number of newcomers serving along veteran officers. Equally, about 80% of enlisted sailors were new to the service. The demographic of Civil War sailors differed from that of soldiers, with most enlistees coming from maritime states with established skills needed on ships (e.g. carpenters, mechanics, and clerks). Additionally, naval crews were more heterogeneous -- encompassing individuals from different towns, states, and nationalities as well as race. Symonds also notes how sailors' portraits differed from their Army counterparts. Naval officers were more likely to visit photographic studios than sailors; hence the greater number of officers portraits in Coddington's study. Unlike soldiers, photographic studios did not have the tools of the sailor on hand, which resulted in less martial poses then one finds with soldier portraits. Symonds also explains the reason many posed with their hands in their vests -- besides mimicking Napoleon it also kept the subject's hand still while the negative was being exposed.</p>  <p>Coddington's Preface discusses his organization of the study, and places the seventy-seven images used into the context of the Civil War. From an organizational and research perspective it is interesting to read how he found the images, making use of private collections, professional contacts, and images he personally acquired. Coddginton also notes how the changes in digital scholarship influenced his research during this project. While researching the first three volumes, Coddington made use of message boards and online forums to track down sources and individuals. With the expansion of online resources (databases, historical newspapers, digital books, and finding aids) he was able to search for individual names across various formats, providing access to sources that would have proven time consuming in the past. Yet it is Coddington's depth of knowledge on the history of Civil War photography which really helps expand the readers understanding of why photography (particularly the <i>cartes de visite</i> ) is so closely linked to the Civil War. Many of the men who fought in the Civil War had grown up with access to photography, with sitting for portraits a common experience. The <i>cartes de visite</i> format not only allowed for subjects to have their portrait taken, but to share copies with friends and family. As Coddington notes, ""Cartes de visite were social media for the nineteenth century. "" (xxv) The <i>cartes de visite</i> format also had the advantage of providing ample room for the subject to write his personal information -- allowing for future identification.</p><p>At the heart of <i>Faces of the Civil War Navies</i> are the seventy-seven portraits Coddington has compiled -- consisting of sixty-two officers, and fifteen enlisted sailors (two of whom are African-American). The portraits are arranged chronologically based on the biography of the subject. Each sailor's biography is short (two to six pages -- depending on the sailor), focusing on his background, why he joined the Navy (either Union or Confederate), the most significant event he participated in, and his fate. While this might sound like a repetitive formula, Coddington's writing style and use of sources make for lively and interesting reading. None of the officers are above command rank -- providing insight into the lieutenants, engineers, and masters mates of the fleet. Readers learn of Lt. Francis Winslow, USN, who was at his in-laws residence in North Carolina when the War began -- having to find a way North to resume his naval career. Readers are presented with the experiences of five sailors who were at the Battle of Mobile Bay. Many of the biographies are from those who served on prominent ships such as the <i>Monitor</i>, <i>Kearsarge</i>, <i>Alabama</i>, and <i>Shenandoah</i>. One also reads of sailors with more mundane experiences -- such as George Ormsbee who was underage when he enlisted -- only to be retrieved by his parents before he even shipped out. Coddington is also not afraid to look at the lives of those with more tragic turns -- including stories of suicide, and drug addiction. As such, in seventy-seven short biographies, one gets the full spectrum of naval experiences by both Union and Confederates sailors on a personal level.</p><p><i>Faces of the Civil War Navies</i> is a notable addition to anyone's Civil War library -- whether they are interested in the War's naval history or social aspects. Coddington does a worthy job providing scholarly biographies that are both interesting to read and informative. The scholarly nature of this work can be appreciated through the thoroughly cited entries, and extensive bibliography. In the end <i>Faces of the Civil War Navies</i> does accomplish Coddington's goal of adding the human story of the war at sea.</p>  <p><i>Joseph-James Ahern is a senior archivist at the University Archives and Records Center at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, PA.

"In Dangerous Pursuit of a Fundamental Freedom<p>Early in its pages, <i>An Indispensable Liberty: The Fight for Free Speech in 19th Century America</i> features a political print from 1838, saluting the memory of the murdered Rev. Elijah Lovejoy. A Presbyterian minister and a journalist, he had died defending his printing press, attacked by a pro-slavery mob in Alton, Ill., the previous year. The print labels Lovejoy a ""martyr,"" but also treats his killing as foreshadowing a coming triumph of his principles: Liberty, in female form, raises a hand as if to bless his press; at her side, a black man sheds his shackles.</p><p>Lee Joliffe, author of the article in which the illustration appears, ""A Press Ablaze: Violent Suppression of Abolitionist Speech, Press, Petition and Assembly,"" regards the crime as fundamental in its effect: Northern newspapers began increasingly to turn critical of slavery after this brazen assault on press freedom. It helped that Lovejoy had hardly been obscure. Mobs had earlier wrecked three of his presses when he lived in St. Louis. Shortly after the final assault, Abraham Lincoln, then a rising young lawyer in Springfield, Ill., spoke to the lyceum there, warning that mob actions threatened democracy itself. </p> <p>Joliffe's is one of 11 informative articles collected in <i>An Indispensable Liberty</i>, edited by Mary W. Cronin. Focused on the long and dangerous struggle for free speech and a free press, these works describe the tenacity of an American ideal and the pressure that could be brought to bear against its exercise 150 years ago. When slavery was the issue, its opponents found their efforts to denounce it would be checked by Congress, which barred anti-slavery journals from the mails, or lynched by thugs. (Lovejoy hardly stood alone.) </p> <p>The Civil War's outbreak in 1861 added a substantially greater challenge to newspaper editors. Political and military leaders could -- and did -- suppress journalists out of concern that the latter might expose troop movements, possibly tipping the scales in coming battles. Notably, civil authorities in Washington and Richmond regarded press freedom as a fundamental American ideal, and decidedly not simply a peacetime luxury. But from time to time, they did step in call a halt to the work of individual journalists and their publications.</p> <p>Debra Reddin Van Tuyll cites research showing far more of these incidents occurred in the North than the South -- reflecting at least in part that the North had many more newspapers and a more developed news culture. The Confederate government incorporated provision for a free press into its constitution -- not entirely surprisingly, given that its political leaders saw themselves as the true heirs of the Founders.</p> <p>Interestingly, in her essay, ""Freedom of the Press in a Slave Society at War,"" she tells us that 35 percent of Southern newspaper editors owned slaves, a higher proportion than among Southern society as a whole. However, shared economic interest did not prevent Southern journalists from criticizing political leaders, up to and including President Jefferson Davis. The Charleston Mercury's Richmond correspondent accused Davis of corruption. Davis let the press alone. His doing so, Reddin Van Tuyll indicates, fit with the overall attitude toward freedom that existed among Southern whites in a slave-owning society. ""Such close proximity to those who had lost all vestiges of freedom could not have helped but give Southerners radical notions about the value of their freedom,"" she writes.</p><p>As for the North in wartime, David W. Bulla describes the shuttering of the <i>Chicago Times</i> in June 1863 as the best-known -- and perhaps least popular -- example of press suppression under Abraham Lincoln. The paper's editor, the Copperhead Wilbur Storey, campaigned hard against slave emancipation and its supporters, most definitely including Lincoln. His fiery editorials eventually provoked General Ambrose Burnside to regard the newspaper as a font of treason and to order the <i>Times</i> shut down, for ""repeated expression of disloyal and incendiary sentiments."" No sooner had Burnside acted than a fierce backlash developed within the Illinois legislature and among Chicago's citizens, thousands took to the streets in protest. Three days after Burnside issued his order, Lincoln overrode it and ended the suppression. Storey resumed bluntly criticizing the president. </p> <p><i>An Indispensable Liberty</i> relates valuable stories of how individual journalists coped with all manner of official and public hostility to their dedicated pursuit of free expression. Erica J. Pribanic-Smith, recounting the intense antagonism experienced by journalists of different political views during Reconstruction, highlights the story of Jason Clarke Swayze, a New Jersey journalist come south to Georgia. Swayze, an ardent Unionist, drew continuing threats from his unreconstructed neighbors for his defense of African American civil rights and his criticism of the Ku Klux Klan. For some, the freedom to speak out and publish public attacks against injustice is a near-useless right unless the bearer of that freedom is prepared to shout it from the housetops.</p>  <p>Stories of unflinching courage in defense of First Amendment rights are particularly important now. Daily, it seems, we are reminded of the public's distain for news organizations and their vital work. Add to that the vociferous hostility aimed at the press during a very long election season -- it is a trend deeply corrosive of a foundational liberty granted us by our nation's Founders who regarded an unbound press as a bulwark of the republic. The essays in this book help remind us of a fundamental freedom we should always value.</p><p><i>Gustav Niebuhr, author of </i>Lincoln's Bishop: A President, a Priest and the Fate of 300 Dakota Sioux Warriors<i> (Harper, 2014), and he is working on a book about religion in America.

6620	9780618428250	$38.00	Lincoln's Lieutenants: The High Command of the Army of the Potomac		Sears, Stephen W.			"Inside the Union High Command<p>The Army of the Potomac, arguably the Union's most important field army, has been the subject of many historical examinations. Classic works like Bruce Catton's beautifully-written narrative trilogy and Rusell H. Beatie's analytical multivolume study have, for years, remained the standard accounts of that army and its exploits during the Civil War. Among modern historians, Stephen W. Sears is perhaps the most well-known modern chronicler of the Army of the Potomac and its campaigns, and his series of books on the Civil War in the East continue to sell to both popular and academic audiences alike.</p><p>Sears, in <i>Lincoln's Lieutenants: The High Command of the Army of the Potomac</i>, takes the army's leadership and command culture as his particular focus. In a sense, Sears' group biography approach may seem rather old-fashioned. By foregrounding the ""great men"" of the army and detailing the complex interplay of relationships, personalities, conflict, and controversies in their experiences, the lives and deaths of common soldiers and those not on the front lines tend to blur into the background of Sears' tale. The officers in <i>Lincoln's Lieutenants</i> are the prime movers in Sears' drama, which is as he intends it. Some may decry such an approach as out of touch or elitist, but his decision to focus on the Army of the Potomac's high command is what makes <i>Lincoln's Lieutenants</i> a particularly valuable contribution to the historiography. The art of command during the Civil War was an especially personal enterprise; human interactions, shared histories, and complicated relationships among a small group of high-ranking military leaders could, and did, shape the nature and course of the conflict. Without a clear understanding of these very personal connections, it is impossible to gain a complete picture of how Civil War armies operated. Sears is to be applauded for undertaking this monumental task and executing it with grace and grandeur.</p><p>For all its rhetorical élan and narrative ambition, there are still quibbles to be found in <i>Lincoln's Lieutenants</i>. Sears, a (critical) biographer of George B. McClellan, spends about half of his 900-plus page effort, or nine of his eighteen chapters, detailing McClellan's tenure as commander of the Army of the Potomac. Ulysses S. Grant, who did not technically command the army but who loomed over George G. Meade's shoulder in Virginia from 1864 to victory, is the subject of only about three total chapters. Further, Sears' criticisms of McClellan are not new, and much his McClellan material is drawn from earlier works on the Peninsula Campaign, Antietam, and other pieces. McClellan partisans will be chagrined at Sears' unsympathetic analysis of ""Little Mac"" as a commander, and Sears seems to be largely unpersuaded by reevaluations of McClellan by Ethan S. Rafuse and others. If readers are looking to Sears for a reinterpretation of the standard McClellan criticisms, many of which were perpetuated by post-war political partisans, they will be disappointed. Also, those hoping that Sears would integrate the wave of fresh Grant historiography now appearing in both academic and popular media will also come away unsatisfied. While much of the Grant and post-Gettysburg Meade material appear to be based on new research, the Overland and Petersburg Campaigns, the Shenandoah Valley Campaign, and the Appomattox Campaign feel surprisingly rushed in a volume so massive in length and scope. Further, Grant's experiences in the Western Theater, so essential in shaping his approach to war in the East, hardly appear at all.</p> <p>Still, <i>Lincoln's Lieutenants</i> is a remarkable achievement. The personalities of most (but not all) of the Army of the Potomac's generals shine through, and the bickering, rivalries, arguments, and power struggles among these leaders makes for fascinating reading. For readers with the patience and endurance to digest such a large book, Sears' work pays dividends in its insights and sheer entertainment value. Scholars will find points of disagreement with some of Sears' conclusions, his use of evidence, and what they may see as outdated or erroneous interpretations, and readers already familiar with his earlier works might long for something new. The book also suffers from a lack of useful maps or organizational charts and tables. But while the sheer weight of detail in <i>Lincoln's Lieutenants</i> might overwhelm some, and the heavy focus on the McClellan years is imbalanced, Sears has managed to present the best single-volume synthetic narrative of the Army of the Potomac's leadership yet written.</p><p><i>Andrew S.

6470	9780465096640	$32.00	CWBR Author Interview:  Thunder at the Gates: The Black Civil War Regiments That Redeemed America		Egerton, Douglas R.			"Interview with Douglas Egerton, author of <i> Thunder at the Gates: The Black Civil War Regiments That Redeemed America</i>  Interviewed by Tom Barber<p></p><p>Civil War Book Review (CWBR): Today the Civil War Book Review is pleased to speak with Douglas Egerton, Professor of History at Le Moyne College and author of several books including <i>The Wars of Reconstructions: The Brief, Violent History of America's Most Progressive Era</i>, <i>Year of Meteors: Stephen Douglas, Abraham Lincoln, and the Election that Brought on the Civil War</i>. Today we are here to talk with him  about his latest book, <i>Thunder at the Gates: The Black Civil War Regiments that Redeemed America</i>, and co-winner of this year's Lincoln Prize. Professor Egerton, thank you for joining us today.<p>Douglas Egerton (DE): Good to talk to you.</p><p>CWBR: What drew you to investigate these black regiments, and can you explain how these units redeemed the United States?</p><p>DE: Sure. The answer to your first question--my books tend to lead one to the next. I never have a plan and as I'm writing I realize that here is something that needs more than the few pages it's getting. And my last book on Reconstruction, one of the people who I wrote about, just got a few pages, was a black boatman from Elmira, New York, who settled in SC after the war, went into state politics, a guy named Stephen Swails, and he was in the 54th and I thought ""There's a lot more to this story here. ""  And of the 1510 identified people of color, men of color, who go on to politics--national and state level in Reconstruction, at least 130 are ex-military. So there's a lot more of this story to tell.</p> <p>In terms of how they redeemed America, they were the guinea pigs--they're the test case these three regiments--and they knew it. White America, including the North, especially among conservative northern democrats were very reluctant for black men to serve, and had grave doubts about ability of black men to be combatants and that opinion kind of turned on a dime after July 18, after the battle of Ft. Wagner. Lincoln wholeheartedly, at that point, began to recruit black soldiers, 180,000 black men served by the end of the war. And so, these guys didn't just kind of redeemed themselves they sort of changed the opinion of white America had toward black soldiers and black citizens, so they're impact was enormous.</p> <p>CWBR: How did these black regiments come to form? African Americans had fought in the nation's conflicts since the Revolution. What went into creating these regiments? </p><p>DE: Well, it wasn't easy. As you mentioned black Americans, of course, had fought in previous conflicts, which white Americans always tried after the conflict to very much forget. And of course, one thing that is very confusing about the Civil War is that when white southerners secede they made it very clear they are leaving because of Lincoln or they're leaving because of perceived attacks on slavery, attacks on the right of slave holders to carry their property into the western territories, so they make it very clear that this is a war about slavery, but that's not for the first two years the Northern point of view. Lincoln makes it very clear this is a war to save the Union, not a war against slavery, no matter what Jeff Davis is saying. So after Ft. Sumter, young black men from Syracuse, where I live, from Chicago, go down and try to enlist, and they're turned away on the orders of Lincoln and Stanton, and the war department, and were told that this is a white man's war, this is not about slavery, and that goes on for two years. Until finally, of course, January 1, 1863, the Emancipation Proclamation goes into effect and now the country has two war aims: reunion, but now also black liberation, and also, of course, because the armies needed more men. It suddenly becomes very sensible to begin to recruit all these black men all across the North, young and able bodied. But of course the way Civil War armies work is that you enlist in a state, even sometimes local regiment, and then you are folded into the larger national army, so you are in the Connecticut 31st or the Virginia 76th. So the governor of Massachusetts, was a liberal Republican, John A. Andrew, the governor of New York--where I live-- was a conservative Democratic who had no interest in black military service, so Andrew is the first guy to write to war department to say ""let's raise a regiment"" and then mid-January Stanton agreed. And so black men from all across the North who wanted to serve, had to go to Boston. They came from all across the North to Readville, which is just outside Boston, at Camp Meigs and join up. Basically, it had been pushed for a long time by activists like Frederick Douglas, but finally Andrew gets the job done. </p><p>CWBR: So why were so many in the North opposed black regiments. It seems militarily, it is the smartest thing to do because, the Confederacy gets a lot military value from black labor, but as you mentioned so many were opposed to these regiments and their formation, and what were some of the reasons? </p><p>DE: Well you know we tend to think, optimistic creatures that we are as Americans, that history moves in one direction--life always gets better. But of course for blacks living in the North the 1850s was one debacle after the next, the Fugitive Slave Act, in which a long free blacks are being captured and returned to slavery in the South. The Dred Scott decision in which the Supreme Court of the United States announces that blacks, even if born free in Boston, are not citizens of the United States. So for a lot of white conservatives, like the governor of New York, Horatio Seymour, if black men can fight and can wear a blue uniform then that was their ticket to citizenship. And so it was really kind of less about, I think, questions about black men's ability to fight, but rather what they thought would happen with black veterans after the war--the political demands they would make, white Americans in the North did not what to concede, and so that was the big push there. </p><p>CWBR: And so, even after these regiments are formed, these sort of political battles don't stop over just the question of whether the regiment should be formed. What other obstacles did the soldiers who joined face off the battlefield? </p><p>DE: Well they faced all kinds of discrimination within the U.S. Army and they also faced the possibility of brutalization by the Confederate army but, first things first, because most people in Congress, including Republicans assumed that blacks assigned on would be driving wagons, digging ditches, working as laborers, arriving without decent clothing.  They're paid only about half of what white soldiers were paid.  White soldiers approximately $13 a month, black soldiers were paid $10 and then $3 dollars was deducted for uniforms that was not deducted from white soldiers.  So they faced that kind of stuff, internal discrimination at least initially, and really until the last few months of the war.  They were not allowed to rise into the ranks of commissioned officers.  Three of the guys that I write about in my book  made that leap and made it to the rank of lieutenant.  Many of the men had served under white officers who had very little training and were much much younger than they were.  There were a lot of white officers that made it very clear, especially outside of black regiments, they just didn't want blacks in the military.  And of course these guys are fighting in much larger groupings with other white units that just don't want them there.  They also sign up knowing that on Christmas Eve 1862 it becomes clear the Emancipation Proclamation is not going to happen.  President Davis issues an edict announcing that black men taken under arms will be sold into slavery and that white officers will be severely executed as insurrectionists, as sort of John Browns.  So these guys are facing trouble within the army and trouble from the Confederates.  They were really in between kind of  a rock and a hard place and yet they sign on anyway. </p>    <p>CWBR: So they sign on and what kind of white officers are tapped to lead these units? </p><p>DE: They mostly come out of the antislavery movement (or at least their parents come out of the antislavery movement, these are all younger guys of course).  The Republicans for the most part, but a lot of them are not hardcore abolitionists.  There is a distinction between being antislavery/mainstream Republican, like Lincoln being a hardcore Garrisonian/Frederick Douglass abolitionist.  They're sons of privilege.  They all go to Harvard, at least the guys I write about.  They come from money and so they're sympathetic to black soldiers and they want to advance the cause, they don't have to do this, they volunteer for this.  But neither do they come from a background that allows them to understand what these men are like. In the film <i>Glory</i> Robert Gould Shaw has a friend Andre Braugher, a character he's known for years but that's completely made up.  Shaw didn't know any black folks before serving in the 54th.  So even though these guys are among the more Progressive, northern white contingent, there's still some kind of friction.  They don't really understand each other very much.  Certainly the working class black guys, the farm boys came from Ohio who served on the 54th and 55th, there's a real cultural gulf between them and the Harvard kids. </p>  <p>CWBR: Is this goal something that's closed over time?  How does it break across the spectrum?  Because in the book, some of these white officers appear to become more sympathetic and others are okay with leading black soldiers but still have a really difficult time with the notion of black citizenship and how service in the army is going to be a foundation toward black citizenship and voting rights. </p>    <p>DE: It varies.  Most of the guys I followed did change over the course of the war.  If a ghastly Civil War won't change your attitude then nothing will.  Lincoln changes at the top.  When Rob Shaw first signs on, he's reluctant to do so because he's with his band of brothers in his white regiment.  He's also afraid his that his fiancé will look down at him for leading black soldiers in battle because it's almost a disreputable thing to do, in Northern opinion. He first, and so famously, is a ""negro colonel"" and of course he doesn't use the term ""negro. "" But he stops, about two months into the training he realizes how good these guys are as soldiers.  He dies at the age of 25, kind of a much more enlightened person.  And two brothers from Philadelphia who I also follow Ned and Pen Hallowell, they also show real progress and they actually look to appreciate the guys, they're leading.  And the fourth white officer I followed, Charles Francis Adams Jr., he's an Adams, he comes from this long line of anti-slave politicians.  He never learns to understand, or like, the guys he leads in the 5th Cavalry.  Basically he goes to his grave harboring doubts about the ability of black men to be horsemen, to be efficient cavalry men.  Later in life he turns on Reconstruction, he turns on black voting rights, he turns on Irish voting rights. Given Adams is a prickly, not very lovable guy.  But the war changes most of these people. </p>  <p>CWBR: One final question, how do many of the soldiers in these regiments transition from being a soldier into a citizen?  How long does the war stay with them and in what ways does it stay with them? </p><p>DE: They're always really, really proud of their service.  One of the photographs I have, in the book, is late 19th century when the Shaw monument was put up in Boston and survivors come and march.  By this time these are old guys, but they want to be there for their last reunion.  So they're always really proud of their service.  Most come back to the north, only Steven Swails settles for a time in South Carolina.  But they're determined to change the north as well, bear in mind of course, only in New England could black men vote before the war.  Equal basis with white men.  New York has a property qualification that is not imposed on white voters.  Lincoln's Illinois, black men can't vote at all, Pennsylvania they can't.  And that's where these guys are coming from.  So when they come home they're going to make certain that the world they live in, is changed.  There will be decent schools for the children, and integrated streetcars for themselves.  And again these are guys who faced tough fire during the war so they're not going to back down when someone tells them to get off their streetcar.  One of the guys that I follow, is Lewis Douglass, the son of Frederick Douglas, who's a sergeant major when he's badly wounded in Fort Wagner and mustard out and after the war he's ice skating outside of Baltimore and some white toughs want him off the rink, so he takes his skates' shoe and he puts it on his hand like a glove and goes after these guys and almost cuts one's thumb off.  These are guys, they faced tough battle and they're not going to back down now so for them the war is just part of their crusade.  It's not the end of their determination to fundamentally change America.</p> <p>CWBR: Professor Egerton, I appreciate you taking the time to sit and discuss your most recent work, <i>Thunder at the Gates: The Black civil War Regiments that Redeemed America.</i></p><p>DE: It was a pleasure, thanks so much.</p>

Bryan Jr., author of <i> The American Elsewhere: Adventure and Manliness in the Age of Expansion</i>  Interviewed by Tom Barber<p></p><p>Civil War Book Review (CWBR): Today the Civil War Book Review is pleased to speak with Jimmy L. Bryan Jr., Associate Professor of History at Lamar University and author of <i>More Zeal Than Discretion: The Westward Adventures of Walter P. Lane</i>. Today we are here to talk with him about his new book, <i>The American Elsewhere: Adventure and Manliness in the Age of Expansion</i>. Professor Bryan, thank you for joining us today.<p>Jimmy L. Bryan Jr. (JB): Thank you.</p>  <p>CWBR: A lot of books come across my desk. Your book's cover and title immediately grabbed my attention. And for everyone listening the cover features a white man clad in brilliant red shirt, wearing buckskin pants and holding a long rifle. I also found the title striking too. I had no idea what an elsewhere was. </p>  <p>Let's begin with the title, and if you could describe, or just answer the question: what was an elsewhere? </p>  <p>JB: Well it's a romantic idea. In the early nineteenth century, as many of your readers know, this was an era in which romanticism was very much discussed and thought about, and celebrated. One of the key components of romanticism is this notion of being unsettled in their current place and current time. Romantics very much celebrated the past, they always seem to be preoccupied with the future, and they are certainly preoccupied with other places. With the florescence of Romanticism during this period, which coincided with U.S. expansion--we are talking the 1810s, 20s, 30s, and 40s--it seemed to capture that notion that Americans, at least a significant number of Americans, were looking to other places. In this case looking across the continent and imagining what the continent might be. In a nutshell where the idea of the American elsewhere comes from. </p>  <p>CWBR: Right, and so it is both this imagined and real place. Let's look at the figure here. How would he--""Long Jakes"" the figure in the portrait on the front of your book--described his motives for becoming a quote mountain man, a frontiersperson, and adventurer? </p>  <p>JB: Well, if you are talking about the model himself, or the type that he represents, it may be two different questions. It is an interesting portrait. One it raises a number of layered questions. It is a portrait by an artist named Charles Deas who had made his way to St. Louis about this period -- the 1840s -- he encountered these trappers that made their way into the interiors and found them as these romantic figures and certainly worthy of the artist's attention. The reason why I mention the contradictions that this painting seems to incorporate is that the adventurer -- the men I study -- and that this portrait would later come to represent, was very much an Anglo-American idea. And that it was very much men who created stories that developed the notion of their racial superiority and their ethnic exceptionalism. I suppose that is a redundant idea, but the model himself, was actually part Native-American and part French. He was among the French trappers that were very much part of this experience and the fur trading industry in the interiors of the continent. The actual title was Long Jacques, it was a French name, and when they sent this portrait to New York to the Union Gallery -- I believe was the name of the association -- the cataloguer there decided to change the name to Long Jakes, make it an Anglo name rather than a French name. So in terms of what his motivations are, obviously if he's a member of  the French and Indian, descendants of the French and Indian along the Mississippi, his motivations would have been quite a bit different than these Anglo-Americans the portrait would later represent. </p>  <p>CWBR: Right, and this disconnect between this image and the actual experience of the West is something your book takes seriously. Unlike other historians, you take the stories that folks like Deas told through their portraits or through their written works seriously, because you argue that they influenced a generation of Americans to travel west either on their feet or in their imagination throughout the 1820s, 30s, and 40s. How did these adventurers themselves encourage territorial expansion through their written works? </p>  <p>JB: They made it personal. To put it simply. They showed ways in which the average American reader could personally connect with this national mission. Whether vicariously through the reading of this genre of literature, I refer to as the adventurelogue, or in some cases of men, in particular they could physically make their way to the territories. This was a time where the spaces of an adventure were accessible to many different classes, and many different classes took part in adventure and certainly many different ethnicities. But the stories that were published primarily, were stories that reinforced the notion that this was an ethnically white experience and primarily a masculine experience. So by making the connection personal, the reader and the individual, becomes personally invested in this mission to extend the territories through a number of narrative techniques, but primarily to show that this was an exceptionally American space because these were exceptionally men who were coming from this space. I'm not sure if that makes any sense. </p>   <p>CWBR: It does. It does. So you are talking about the adventurelogues and the people in the East who are going to be lured to the West, what kind of social groups in the more settled parts of the United States in the early nineteenth century did these adventurelogues appeal to? Who was their primary readership, what were they looking for? </p>  <p>JB: I'm not sure I can specify a group. My general argument is that is appealed to everyone. Now there are those who certainly were already quite wealthy and comfortable in their stations who might have been less inclined to go west, so I guess you could refer to them as middle-class and lower middle class, if you wanted to put a class spin to this. But in terms of sections of the nation, they seem to have come equally from both sections. Although there tended be to be a greater level of literacy from the north and northeast, and that may explains some of the bias in the source material that I referenced. They come from the city; they come from the farms; they come from the very poor working class; they come from a fairly wealthy middle class if not the more wealthy class. So I'm not sure there is one specific group. </p>  <p>CWBR: Right, in the book you talk about some of these push forces that made the elsewhere described in adventurelogues appealing. What were these folks interested in finding? Why did they leave the safety and comfort of the east to go west to these real and imagined places that were both dangerous and unknown? </p>  <p>JB: Exactly. This was of course what some historians refer to the Market Revolution in the United States, where the economy is changing rapidly and more to the point, at least our point, is that the position of middle class and workers within that economy is changing rapidly. There is a great deal of emphasis placed on personal success, personal wealth, a great deal of emphasis placed on impersonal and materialistic matters, and this alienated a number of men, primarily, in the east in the city, for that matter on the farm. They felt a sense of disconnection, if you will. And by making their way out west to go on these adventures, not only would they have the opportunity to feel emotion--and that's where the Romanticism comes in--the very intense emotional experience, but there is also the opportunity to perhaps obtain wealth and fame. These were certainly individuals who were interested in becoming famous and becoming wealthy. But also a significant draw, was the comradery with other men and forging these very strong, personal, affectionate relationships between men that would go out and experience these adventures together, and I think it was a way of finding a connection they were not able to find back home, which at least in their minds was an impersonal world that tore apart those personal connections. </p>  <p>CWBR: What I really enjoyed, and what you mentioned several times in the book, is that what this generation of men are doing in the 20s, 30s, and 40s isn't necessarily new. Americans in the Jeffersonian era, most famously I suppose with Lewis and Clark, had explored and written about the west, the territory that was unknown to these folks in the east. The adventurelogue does something different and it thinks about the west in different ways. Can you describe the differences between what you looking at, and what you found, in the adventurelogues that thousands of Americans were reading in the east and previous attempts to imagine the west and imagine the United States' place in this world? </p>   <p>JB: Thomas Jefferson, after the Louisiana Purchase, was certainly interested in understanding what he had just bought from the French, and sent explorers -- Lewis and Clark, Zebulon Pike among others -- to catalogue the west, to determine what's there. Of course, I'm talking in general terms. But the idea was to create an empirical catalogue of the west, and those were typically Army officers as William Clark was and Zebulon Pike. They tended to have a more Whiggish outlook, a more rational outlook, a more sober outlook of the world. When they travelled across the Great Plains, for example, they saw a world that did not quite fit this idea of agrarian empire that was so much a part of the Jeffersonian idea. So when they wrote about those expeditions, they were very cautious, and the prospect of future generations of Americans making use of that land in that way. What happens is that these adventurers, these romantics, making their way west, saw a different use for that territory. Part of that was a need to try and come up for a justification for acquiring that land. Of course, as far a Europe was concerned, the U.S. had already confirmed their title to that territory, but there many hundreds of Native American groups who still contested that terrain, and it would require conquest. And of course Americans, they do not like to view themselves as conquerors, they don't like to see themselves as the bad guy , and so they had to come up with stories in order to dismiss the more negative aspects of that conquest, and that's where these adventurers and their adventurelogues, using the Romantic toolkit, if you will, to re-inscribe, to reimagine what this terrain was useful for. And primarily it was about evoking an emotional connection. Not only in terms of this sense of monumentalism of the mountains, the expansiveness of the Great Plains, but the idea of this personal experience and that this land was already and  naturally and inevitably an American space, and that it had generated these exceptional American men. </p>    <p>CWBR: Now, as you and many other historians noted, violence played a definitive role in territorial expansion and so how did many of the writer-adventurers in your book reconcile the violence and peril that regularly punctuated their lives with their personal questions for independence in these elsewheres? </p>  <p>JB: Well, they created stories to obscure the violence or make that violence noble in some way. One of the key tactics that I actually get into more in an article that I wrote in an anthology that I edited called the ""Martial Imagination. "" I look specifically at Texas Rangers, and how the press and outside observers try to make sense of these rangers, many of whom were part of this adventuristic idea and this is at the time of the U.S.-Mexican War. And the argument that I make is that they could not ignore the violence, the brutality that the Texas Ranger represented, so in order to deal with that and recognizing that violence and brutality was necessary in this project of conquest, was that they created this idea of the Texas Ranger, and I suppose by analogy we could say more generally the adventurer, as this agent of violence but yet is somehow excused because he's exoticized it somehow, he's an exaggerated version of the American and because of his experiences out west. I suppose I do get into this when I talk about this philosophy of a savage life, which was an idea presented by a short story writer, who was also a Texas Ranger by the name of Charles Webber, who tried to explain this in a way that the average, typically the reader back east, could not understand the harsh world and the kinds of travails and dangers that these adventurers faced and therefore were not worthy of judging or assisting the morality of those who had to inflict this violence. So in some ways, it's kind of blaming the victim for creating the violence and the victim then becomes deserving of having violence inflicted back on them. It is very much--I'm kind of rambling here--it reminds me of the argument Richard Slotkin makes about the Alamo. And the reason the Alamo is so large in our imagination, we celebrate the Alamo and Little Bighorn much more than we do the actual victories out west. But it is these tremendous losses, these so called massacres, that allow these culture makers to spin the story and present the Anglo-American conquest as the just cause of vengeance. In many ways it victimizes, it creates victims out of the conquerors, if that makes any sense. And so it is a way of insulating the violence, making the argument that readers who have not experienced this, who are simply comfortable back home, at the fire, reading this book could not understand the reality of this extraordinary world and this extraordinarily violent world. </p>  <p>CWBR: Absolutely, so you are saying that peril and danger in a way helps legitimize violence. Can you comment a little about how that same peril creates a sort of, you called it, alternative masculinity? How do those two things work? How does the same peril that legitimizes violence also help create a new masculinity? </p>  <p>JB: I'm a little cautious in calling it a new masculinity, and you mentioned alternative masculinity and I think that's a good way of putting it. One of the things I try to remind myself, and hopefully remind my readers, is that when we are talking about these shifts in idea they are very often rehashing older ideas, they're just building upon something that is already established. In the case of this violence, in particularly violence on the frontier, those were stories that were already being told in the U.S. since at least the eighteenth century. Go back to at least Daniel Boone, if not further than that with John Filson's biography of Daniel Boone, and that's the story of the frontiersmen and that the frontier and the violence of the frontier, and the hardships of the frontier, created these transformations of these exceptional men. So when adventurers come along, in the 20s, 30s, and 40s, they borrow from that narrative and make it their own and they emphasize the role that danger plays. Not only for its emotional response, but also in terms of the hardship that you overcome, which according to their views, creates a much more vital man. Of course this anticipates the idea of Social Darwinism--survival of the fittest--those stories that would emerge in another imperial era in the late nineteenth century. What this is running counter to is again the idea back east, I guess we can refer to as Whiggish masculinity, that certainly from the northeast and New England and along the Atlantic coast, that emphasizes sobriety, that emphasizes restraint and defining in what makes a proper man. It is a man who is responsible to their community and to their family. So these adventurers, when they go out west, they create, or reinvent this idea, of the vital frontiersmen that counters that notion of the seriousness, the sobriety, the restraint of the eastern man. Of course that's where Romanticism comes into play as well, and it very much celebrates unrestraint, it celebrates irrationally over rationalism, it certainly very emotionally linked to the sentimental man of the nineteenth century that also runs counter to the rational, ind
strious male, I think is a term that we use to describe this Whiggish mentality back east.</p>  <p>CWBR: Right, and so part of this alternative masculinity that is developed by these adventurers relies on cultural appropriation. and can you talk about how material culture both in reality and in these adventurelogues, helped a lot of these folks reading, and going to these elsewheres appropriate masculinity from various they encountered in the west, but ultimately leave out or marginalize in the adventurelogues that are produced? </p>  <p>JB: Yeah, there is certainly a lot of literature on the way that Anglo-men, and Anglo-Americans in general, viewed Native America, in particular how they the imagery of Native America some of that was an appropriation of actual Native American traits and material culture, but mostly it was an apparition of something that was equally invented. So when these adventurers made their way to the west, they made their way with preconceived ideas of Native American men, and of course would come and encounter them and would associate with them, and they were fascinated with Native American men in particular and their masculine aspect. And they certainly saw Native American men, and their masculine culture of many Native American groups, as something they wanted to emulate, and that in itself becomes a model of manliness they wanted to adopt for themselves. And in many ways, it becomes a way of not only appropriating, but it becomes a way of conquest, it is a way of usurping those emblems and taking them away from Native American men and adopting that for themselves. Some of the material aspects of course, one of the very powerful emblems was the buckskin. Adventurers, that I look into, adopted the buckskin outfit as an emblem of attaining the exceptionalism they were looking for, and that comes directly from their perception of Native America. So you would have these upstarts or these greenhorns--the term they used at the time--these amateurs that would make their way west for the first time, and they would immediately go out and buy themselves a buckskin outfit to show that they had attained this veteran-hood that they are pretending to claim. And even those who would eventually what they would perceive as an authentic veteran status, that buckskin would play an important role signifying that attainment of this type of manliness they were looking for. Certainly, there were other aspects of Native American culture and Native American men that they certainly admired. One of the interesting aspects is this perception that Native American were both stoic and able to contain their emotions, but yet they were extraordinarily passionate individuals. And somehow these two ideas that seem contradictory to each other but they in a strange degree reinforce each other; the notion that Native American men would have such depth of passion that it creates a greater idea of manliness that he has the ability to control those emotions until the appropriate moment. And that's the notion of this Romantic savagery that views the idea of passion, of violence that was associated with Native Americans, and often erroneously associated with Native Americans, as something itself worthy of emulation. It was, again, of contrasting themselves with the industrious male back east. </p>  <p>CWBR: As you note in the book, these adventurers reach their crescendo by the 1840s, many of them will participate in the war with Mexico, and find their place in the elsewhere in Texas, how was the American victory the beginning of the end for these adventurers? </p>  <p>JB: One argument I could make, and I hope I didn't make, but I may have alluded to it, was that the end of the U.S.-Mexican War with the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, that the project of territorial expansion was over  and therefore there was less need for these adventurers to justify that conquest. And we do see a lessening of interest in those adventuristic ideas in the 1850s, but I want to make sure to be understood that we're not talking about a beginning or an end, but it's more of a waxing and waning. The interest in adventure is still there. You certainly have artists that follow, the adventure artists I talk about in the book like George Catlin, Alfred Jacob Miller, and Charles Deas whose painting we used for the cover of the book. And then others like Tate...who in the 1850s are still creating painting of buckskin clad trappers, and they were still quite popular. But the idea begins to wane especially as the nation is moving more and more toward dealing with this crisis with slavery in the new territories and becoming much more sectional. And so, this idea of this western man, this adventurer, it takes a backseat, if you will, to a more north and south orientation, and so it is not so much an end but a diminishing. And as I point out in the conclusion to the book, that idea is eventually resurrected once again in the 1880s and 1890s when the United States is once again looking toward expanding. In this case expanding overseas into the Caribbean and the South Pacific, of course with the Spanish American War, and certainly Theodore Roosevelt was famous for resurrecting these ideas of the strenuous life and himself donning the buckskin outfit famously in those photographs. And so, these ideas were not new when adventurers were talking about them in the 1820s and 1830s and 40s, and they would persist and in many ways they are still with us today. It is just a kind of waxing and waning idea. </p>  <p>CWBR: Right, and that's what I really appreciated about the book. My last question is: where is the elsewhere today? Would the Internet count as an elsewhere? It is a really fascinating idea, and like you said, it has a lot of traction in American history and the American imagination. Any thoughts on that?</p>  <p>JB: You could make an argument. I think it is an interesting notion. Certainly if you view the elsewhere as this place where fictions are generated and bought into the internet, you can certainly make that analogy. One of the larger lessons, I suppose, that I certainly learned from the work I put into the book, is just understanding groups of people willingly fool themselves--how should I put this--eager they are to buy into stories that mitigate or obscure the ugly side of history or the ugly side of  policy making. We certainly can--how would put this--condemn those who create these stories, but certainly we have to be mindful of those who buy into those stories. What the <i>American Elsewhere</i> does I hope, at least in a general way, is to illustrate in a case and point how groups of people create stories to further their agendas if you will. </p>  <p>CWBR: Right, and I think you illustrated that point very well. Professor Bryan I appreciate you taking the time to sit and discuss your most recent work <i>The American Elsewhere: Adventure and Manliness in the Age of Expansion</i>.</p><p>JB: I appreciate it. It was fun. </p>  <p>CWBR: Thank you.</p>

Today we are here to talk with her about her new book, <i>Sex and the Civil War: Soldiers, Pornography, and the Making of American Morality</i>. Professor Giesberg, thank you for joining us today.</p>      <p>Judith Giesberg (JG): Thank you so much for having me.</p>      <p>CWBR: What led you to consider the topic of sex and the Civil War?</p>      <p>JG: I was reading a book about the sexual conversation that occurred in the antebellum period; and this book that I was reading was for a class I teach on gender. I was surprised to learn that Anthony Comstock had served in the U.S. Army during the Civil War. So these two time lines that I always thought of as very distinct--that is the post war backlash against women and the Civil War which is the period I study regularly, I had always thought that they were distinct to those two things--then I discovered Comstock served in the Army which seemed to me something I needed to explore further.</p>      <p>CWBR: Right, and so your book does a great job of taking this narrative from antebellum America to post war America. Can you describe the contours of antebellum censorship and pornography in terms of law and printed material?</p>       <p>JG: Sure. In the decades leading up to the Civil War there was in the United States, in Great Britain,  and in France an ongoing legal back and forth about controlling--or how each of these nations would control access to, and the arrival at their shores of erotic material. There were a cluster of laws and regulations that appeared in the decades leading to the Civil War. In the United States in particular, but also in the U.K. these items were seen as a foreign threat; something that was coming in imported from abroad, so the first attempt to control the flow of these materials. And again this is a conversation between these three countries, and reformers in all three of these countries, was an 1842 customs law that was passed in the United States that covered a lot of different materials, but one section of it referred to the importation of erotic materials, and instituted the first attempt to control the flow of these, or to ban these items from being imported into the United States. And similar things were attempted in the U.K. as well, and in France a lot of the regulation or the conversation about these materials happened more often in the courts. Their (France's) sort of antebellum conversation about pornography was actually much more public than it was in the United States and in Great Britain. In the United States, it was tucked into this customs law. Of course, it won\'t surprise anybody that the passing of this customs law didn\'t do anything to control people\'s access to erotica, what it actually did was encourage the production of domestic porn. Entrepreneurs in New York City saw this as an opportunity to produce this stuff locally. Of course, with no copyright laws or anything else protecting this stuff, a lot of this stuff they produced and printed in New York City was simply forgeries of the stuff that had been previously imported. Just a few years before the war began you really see an explosion of this stuff produced domestically and available cheaply and much of it was produced in New York City.</p>      <p>CWBR: But I get the feeling that even though there was the customs law, you mentioned passed before the Civil War, there wasn\'t much of a regulatory mechanism or desire to regulate before the War. Can you talk about that?</p>      <p>JG: Right. Absolutely. There really wasn\'t. Like I said, it was subtly tucked into this series of regulations on imports, and it was really up to local enforcement for this regulation to have teeth. And there was very little of that it would seem. There were a few pretty well covered cases in New York City where some well-known producers of this stuff--printers and marketers of this stuff--stood trial, but really very few of them were ever charged with a crime, and those who were charged with a crime they got slaps on the wrist and back to producing this stuff within a year or two of prosecution. There really wasn\'t a strong will to use this customs law to prosecute producers of erotica and the result that very little happens, there very few consequences to those who produced this stuff. And it depended on the political winds. If somebody was elected into office on a platform of reform there was an uptick in at least the threats of a cleaning up of this business, and prosecution, but in the end there really wasn\'t that will, and there certainly wasn\'t any federal mechanism at all for regulation of these materials.</p>       <p>CWBR: In addition to being more and more available, you also suggest that much of the content deemed pornographic, or what would eventually be deemed pornographic, was far from foreign from the reading public. How did abolitionist literature overlap with, and reflect the erotic imagination in antebellum America?</p>         <p>JG: Some of the particular themes that arise, that appear pretty regularly in antebellum erotica--you know flagellation--and sometimes interracial sex and other sorts of things appear in antebellum erotica. Of course, when abolitionists are trying to educate the Northern public about the dark secrets of the slave South, some of those same themes and illustrative moments will appear in antebellum abolition publications. And, I think a lot of your listeners are probably familiar with the work done by Katherine Halttunen, who talks about this pornography of pain, which is a theme that gets developed in a lot of antebellum reform literature in this Anglo-American world, and you certainly see that in American abolition. So, at the same moment they are tut-tutting and critiquing the aggressive sexuality that they see developing in the slave South, or what they see as the ultimate condemnation of the slave South, they are (those critical of abolition) also using those same tropes in their literature to raise awareness about the evils of abolition. So there is this sort of careful tightrope that they walk, so at the same time condemning the erotic imagination, but also exploiting it for the purposes of spreading the word about why we should all be morally outraged by slavery.</p>      <p>CWBR: You also talk about how in the antebellum United States this material wasn\'t heavily regulated and then Civil War happens, so can you talk about how the Civil War helped grow the domestic pornographic industry and what sorts of technologies helped the spread of erotic literature during the Civil War?</p>      <p>JG: Those who had been active in marketing, and selling this stuff, during the antebellum period and had on occasion had run-ins with the law, and had faced at least court cases had wound up in court because of these here-one-day and gone-the-next-day efforts to control this stuff. They had also begun to experiment with sending this stuff through the mail, which allowed them to avoid local prosecution--because all of it was done locally, then one solution they innovated during the antebellum period, in New York at least, was to mail the stuff. So you can see how that was probably the most important thing erotica dealers experimented with before the War. So you can see in some of the flash weeklies, ads taken out by these erotic dealers, some of them in not very coded language, and some of it much more coded, in which they are selling this stuff cheaply through the mail. And in the ads, they guarantee they\'ll protect the purchaser\'s identity and it will all be very discreet. So you can see some of that stuff appearing by the mid-to-late 1850s you can see these ads appearing in flash weeklies in New York, so that stuff is there, and that process is there; or, that way to avoid local prosecution is already in place when the war begins. And then when the war begins, these some of these ads and these circulars that are produced by erotic dealers adapt very quickly to the moment of the war. So they use language elides themselves with the war. Talking about this stuff that it is produced in particular for the men, and they certainly create new erotic materials that seem to be responding in particular to the exigencies of war; or, this sort of moment in time that men find themselves--and they mail the stuff to the men, and conveniently  these men were concentrated in U.S. military camps. The stuff gets there easily, and of course, mail delivery is improved throughout the Civil War and the stuff gets there faster and faster at least in the Union. And erotica dealers are ready to exploit that opportunity. Of course, printing is also another thing that we should add to our list of innovations that make this stuff more widely available. And then of course all the new photographic images that are available--the <i>cartes de visite</i>. The erotica dealers mass produce erotic <i>cartes de visite</i> of famous women that they circulate to the men and that are widely available. There are erotic playing cards, stereographs--pretty much any new kind of imaging or photographic technology--the erotica dealers are ready to exploit it and turn it into profits for themselves.</p>          <p>CWBR: With all of this, the technology, the concentration of men, basically suggests that pornographic material was ubiquitous in U.S. Army camps. How did this material impact camp life and how did it influence social relationships between men of different classes, military ranks, and ethnic backgrounds?</p> <p>JG: It is hard to find the stuff in camps as you can imagine--it wasn't collected by people who collect; it wasn't achieved by local historical societies; it doesn't show up often in personal collections. It was hard to find the stuff, and put it in men's hands, but they do mention their reading and they mention moments when they see this stuff. Or when they interact with each other over the stuff that they are reading or the images they are looking at. And most importantly it winds up, or at least I found a concentration of these references, in U.S. Court Martial records. In order to find this stuff in men's hands, the trickiest part of it, and they'll even say, a couple of men mention, they are very careful what they have on their person when they go into battle. We do have some soldiers referencing stuff they find discarded on the side of the road. This is not stuff they want to wind up in their last effects and sent home, but because sometimes these guys who are reading the stuff, or circulating this stuff, are also just bad soldiers, we do find references to the stuff in U.S. Court Martial records. And that for me was a really important source to answer that question that you just posed: How does this material work? And how does it become part of the exchanges between men from different classes, different regions, different ranks, and experience. What I found interesting about it is a few things. First, how much of this stuff they all seemed to know and be aware of and share. There was this shared language and this shared knowledge of these materials that became obvious in the court martial records. Men didn't have to say a whole lot in testifying against each other to have other people on the court martial records to know exactly what book they were talking about or what bawdy song they might have been mentioning. So clearly, there was a shared knowledge of this stuff. People knew what it was and had that kind of shared knowledge of this corpus of erotic material that was circulating around the camps.</p><p>What I also found interesting about it was that officers and their men could share, across ranks, in a way that could bring men together, but it could also be used, and it was often used oftentimes, as a way to discredit men. It could be used to discredit men who held rank over their men, and were trying to use the stuff to bond with their men, but it was also a dangerous thing. Because men could use it against their officers in a way that suggests to us that they through erotic material they could still exercise some of their own authority. There wasn't this settled hierarchy when sharing this stuff, and that it could go back and forth, which I thought was very interesting. Also this sort of expectation that men should be able to be aware of what other men were doing in camps at any given time--this way of looking, and seeing, that comes with reading this stuff was very interesting too and it underscores how very little privacy any of these men expected while they were in the U.S. Army, but the expectation that they should be able to watch one another become very obvious when you look at these court martial records.</p> <p>CWBR: And as you go on to talk about, some men didn't want to, right? So, you spend a reasonable amount of time thinking and writing about Anthony Comstock, a man who served in the war, but only gained national notoriety after the conflict for his campaign against pornography. First, who was Anthony Comstock? Second, what was the relationship Comstock's military career and his anti-pornography campaign after the war?</p>    <p>JG: He is one of those characters that I think, for anybody who studies this period, you want to try and find the story behind the man. He is not a very sympathetic character in most histories of this period. On the other hand, his brother had died as a result of his wounds at Gettysburg and like a good younger brother, he followed his brother and took his brother's place in his brother's regiment. They're from Connecticut, so they both severed with the 17th Connecticut. And he was sort of in that way, very traditional. Right, his brother had severed and when his brother passed away, he believed it was his responsibility to take his brother's place. He came into the regiment very late and unlike his brother never really found his place in the U.S. Army. He kept a diary of his time and that's all we really have to go on, other than official records--the regimental order book and other regimental histories of the 17th. It was an awkward fit for him to be in the Army. I think he came into a regiment that was very seasoned and he was a green recruit and throughout his time in the 17th he didn't seem to ever settle into that life. He recorded his unsettling feelings throughout his time with the 17th in his diary. And he sort of imagined himself, at least based on his diary, and then on the biographies, the sort of officially sanctioned biography written after the war, he fancied himself to be an army man and certainly created that image for himself after the war. The truth of matter is that he didn't see combat and what he did more than anything he served as part of an occupying force--he drilled and he sort of chaffed against the culture of the camp. Whereas men, as I mentioned in the court martials, knew the language and shared an interest in and a knowledge of these erotic materials. For Comstock these kinds of conversations, and his own sorts of feelings, provided a great level of discomfort for him.</p><p>In the aftermath of the war, and toward the end of his army career, he gets involved, and gets recruited by the United States Christian Commission and through his connection there will be involved with the YMCA in New York. And, Through the support of these institutions will lobby for, and successfully oversee the administration of the really rigorous anti-pornography laws that will become known as the Comstock Law.</p><p>CWBR: And again, with the censor
hip of erotic literature, the first censorship attempt, well the second attempt after the earlier customs law, appeared as a war measure in 1865, and still garnered little attention. But less than a decade in 1873, like you mentioned, Congress passed the Comstock Law which expanded the law's original and appointed a special agent to enforce the law, who will be Anthony Comstock. So what was the original law's scope and purpose? And how were anti-pornography advocates able to transform censorship into this national issue, and what kind of common concerns were they able to seize upon to do this?</p><p>JG: Great, yeah. So the 1865 law, was a war measure and it was passed in Congress as part of a series of regulations securing the mail from many different threats mail delivery had experienced during the war, and again, like the antebellum measures were sort of slipped into this larger measure about allocating money for and the securing delivery of the U.S. mail during war time. And it elicited a little bit of conversation in Congress, one congressman went back and forth and what were we really trying to protect men from, and whether this was simply political effort to censor speech. Was this a Republican administration attempting to paint the loyal opposition as obscene? Because the measure outlawed the mailing of obscene material through the U.S. mail and there was some of that conversation in Congress about sort of how far this law would go, and whether or not postmasters would be authorized to open mail that was suspicious and whether or not they would empower these men to destroy these materials. And there was that interesting moment that this is just a political move on the part of the Republican party to censor the opposition, but the measure passed. And there really wasn't, in its first few years, there were very few arrests under the 1865 measure, but it set a very important precedent for the Comstock law that would be passed in 1873, which really was much more ambitious effort. The Christian Commission was behind the 1865 measure and then a lot of them same people would wind up at the YMCA who was behind the Comstock law in the 1870s. And by that time too, these reformers have sort of woven this narrative about these young men who need to be protected, which was in the '65 measure as well, and the certainly in the '65 debate, about what the measure meant. By the 1870s this has become in their minds, they have taken this out to its logical extreme. For these reformers they were worried about what kinds of behaviors men would exhibit who read this material. And Comstock would provide that fulcrum on which this argument would turn, which was that men who read this stuff-- he says this in the books he writes in the post war era--men who read this stuff become violent--that the sort of problem of violence we see in post war and among young people, is a result of reading this erotic material. And by the 1870s, they are helped along by organizations like Women's Christian Temperance Union which is also interested in reform and urban reform, and protecting families from things like alcoholism and violence and things like that. So there is this sort of opportune moment when this stuff is being supported by a groundswell of support by reformers who have identified a problem, and they have this foundation from which they can argue that they have also identified the source of the problem and the solution.</p><p>CWBR: Right, and you also mention another really important part of this coalition were doctors who saw a sort of natural, or at least a temporary ally in Comstock and these moral reformers. So what were the medical profession's objectives with aligning with Comstock?</p><p>JG: Right, so there are on a state by a state level there are laws passed regulating the people qualified to practice and there is sort of interesting dynamic where they also get involved with some of these local anti-pornography measure, and there are lots of doctors in the Comstock lobbying. At the last minute, the Comstock law also includes regulating, not only the classic antebellum erotica that we had seen in some of those local prosecutions, but [it] also talk about materials that included in obscene materials those materials usually associated with birth control and abortion. So those materials get added on to these laundry lists on some of these local initiatives, but also in the Comstock law. And the Comstock law -- the local state laws get longer and longer -- and the Comstock law reads like a laundry list of materials and stuck into those materials are materials that are associated with women's reproduction. And, that is the sort of moment where you have to scratch your head. None of that stuff was of interest to anybody in the antebellum period and it certainly wasn't part of local efforts to eradicate this erotic material, but in the post war era Comstock's efforts are very attractive and very appealing to medical professionals who are seeking to professionalize and also to control the administration of medical care. And of course, this jibes really well with Comstock's campaign, and in the end what the Comstock laws do more than anything, is not really eradicate that erotica at all, but he and the laws are used very effectively to run abortion providers, birth control providers out of business as I'm sure a lot of your listeners know. He takes particular pleasure in naming how many these ""irregular practitioners"" he has rounded up and brought in for prosecution.</p><p>CWBR: Exactly, that is where we get this new, rather expanded form of American morality. Professor Giesberg, I appreciate you taking the time to sit and discuss your most recent work <i>Sex and Civil War: Soldiers, Pornography, and the Making of American Morality</i>.</p><p>JG: Thank you so much for asking me to talk about it.</p><p>CWBR: Thank you.</p>

6359	9780674088221	$35.00	CWBR Author Interview:  Aiming for Pensacola: Fugitive Slaves on the Atlantic and Southern Frontiers		Clavin, Matthew J.			"Interview with Matthew J. Clavin, author of <i>Aiming for Pensacola: Fugitive Slaves on the Atlantic and Southern Frontiers</i>  Interviewed by Tom Barber<p></p><p>Civil War Book Review (CWBR):  Today the Civil War Book Review is happy to speak with Matthew J. Clavin, associate professor of history at the University of Houston and author of the 2009 book <i>Toussaint Louverture and the American Civil War: The Promise and Peril of a Second Haitian Revolution</i>.  Today we get to discuss his new book <i>Aiming for Pensacola: Fugitive Slaves on the Atlantic and Southern Frontiers</i>. </p>          <p>CWBR: When did fugitive slaves begin aiming for Pensacola and why? </p>        <p>Mattew J. Clavin (MC):  I think I may have footnoted in the book because sometimes you don't want to make extreme claims about concrete proof.  But when in the early 16th century when the Spanish first traveled along the Gulf of Mexico past present day Pensacola, this is when you had Esteban the Moor.  And as they passed Pensacola and Esteban was on that ship as were a dozen or so black servants who also served as soldiers and explorers and pioneers, but two men from their journey as they got to Pensacola and they stopped and they met with some Indians, but it was a Creek shipwright if memory serves and an African slave disappeared.  For many years it was sort of claimed that these people were killed by the Indians or something like that but there was no evidence of that whatsoever based on the Spanish documents.  It's just as likely that this Creek/Spanish sailor and this enslaved African sailor for the Spanish, did they just sort of abandon the vessel and disappeared into the Pensacola wilderness?  So arguably early 1500s was the first time not only did you have a slave possibly escape, but it was a slave with a white man.  Which you know is sort of the whole crux of the research that I've spent years exploring.  Pensacola for many centuries just had a habit of attracting runaway slaves, runaway servants but it also served as a launching point from which servants and slaves would escape.  So, I think the thing I'm really amazed with, and what always fascinated me about the project, was that continuity over time.  So maybe that didn't happen in the early 1500s, maybe these runaways were in fact just some Indians killed them or kidnapped them.  But definitely, when you start to have large settlements in the 18th century for sure, and definitely into the 19th century, there's just such a long trend of Pensacola being sort of the focal point of runaway slaves. </p>               <p>CWBR:  Now it's good that you bring that up because part of this continuity it seems in the book is this idea of interracialism and its role in defining these relationships.  So could you briefly define what interracialism is and what drew you to interpreting Pensacola through this lens? </p>               <p>MC:  Yeah it's so hard to define race and it's arguably even harder to define interracialism, so I'll try.  Anytime you start to research and write a project there's always this profound secondary literature that provides a whole bunch of context and a lot of ideas that infuse and inflect your thinking.  In the last ten to twenty years there's been a lot of discussions of abolitionists and radicals and otherwise.  President Lincoln, by the end of the Civil War, these predominantly white men, very wealthy-elite, often times highly educated they come around on the issue of racial equality.  Some people it's more inherent than others and I don't repute that ever taking place.  I think it happened for sure, but what I think of interracialism, the way I define it is, black and white people in this case, but it can be other racial groups as well and ethnic groups but certainly along the Gulf Coast in Pensacola in particular what I find is there are black and white people living side-by-side, working side-by-side, drinking side-by-side, running away from their masters or employers side-by-side.  So it doesn't mean they are best friends necessarily--it doesn't even mean they get along necessarily all the time, but for whatever reason they coexist.  Maybe that's another way to view it, they coexist and the society around them can be binary, it could be completely racialized.  One group is enslaved and unfree and the other group is completely free.  Nonetheless you will find instances not just in American history, in Southern history, but in world history.  All these examples, particularly along the waters you find black and white people coexisting very well together.  Sometimes it's a bonafide friendship, sometimes it involves sex and reproduction but often times it's just camaraderie.  And I think there's different forms of interracialism, but I view it as groups of people who look differently but they get along for whatever reason. </p>        <p>CWBR:  In addition to this concept of interracialism, one of the more causative factors you use is region, it figures pretty heavily in Pensacola and you'd already mentioned the Atlantic world.  So how did Pensacola's place, within the Atlantic world, and later along the Southern frontier, empower inhabitants to challenge slavery and official support for slavery? </p>             <p>MC:  Geography is crucial to this story and as I watched and lived in Pensacola, now I live in Houston Texas, I'm no stranger to hurricanes and the threats of hurricanes.  Hurricane Matthew just swept through, and you're reminded repeatedly that you can have the greatest of intentions, resources, and people etc., but if a massive climatic event visits your neighborhood or colony or state you're futile to resist.  Anyone who knows Pensacola's history, knows there were multiple attempts to make it a great Spanish port.  Particularly in the very beginning, and it was the weather of all things, it was the hurricanes that kept Pensacola from being the first permanent European settlement in North America and eventually it was St. Augustine.  St. Augustine is in the eye of the storm often times, but for whatever reason in the 16th century people who settled in St. Augustine were lucky and avoided these storms, they weren't able to do that in Pensacola.  So for Pensacola's history after the 1500s still, to get colonized, to become an important port and all these things, colonization came in and fits and starts, but it was never completely successful.</p>  <p>I would make the argument that Pensacola doesn't become really economically viable until the early 19th century with the advent of the U.S. Military and they made Pensacola a military town, a military base, and even today anyone familiar with Pensacola knows it's inseparable from the military-industrial complex.  So prior to the U.S. Government coming in, Pensacola was very, very frontier and it's a unique way of viewing Pensacola because it's on the waterfront, it's on the water's edge, it's at the edge of the Atlantic world, so it's a lot of things at the same time but from a North American point of view it's on the outskirts.  It's a liminal territory, it has a very difficult time developing and maturing whereas Mobile, Alabama--New Orleans in Louisiana these places take off by late 18th century, and Pensacola never quite equals them in maturation.  I think it's that immaturity, it's that liminality that enables things like race and slavery to not take root as deeply here as they do in neighboring places.  One thing, whenever I talk about my book in Pensacola, I need to make it clear to people that this is not the promise land for African descended people, I mean slavery is on the books in the British period, the Spanish period and the American period.  It is not what I would call a safe haven, nevertheless compared to Mobile, Savannah, Georgia and New Orleans it does offer things to slaves or fugitives that these other places don't. </p>        <p>CWBR:  Throughout your book, because it covers the Colonial era all the way up to the Civil War, you make use of slave advertisements to great effect.  In some instances, you are able to recover the experiences of people who have otherwise left no written records.  So tell us a little bit about your encounters with these sources and how they shaped your thinking about the topic and the ultimate outcome of the book itself? </p>        <p>MC:  This goes back years to when I was in graduate school and it was late 20th century, the very beginning of the turn of the 21st century and it was only then that recognized historians not only did they use slave narratives and runaway slave advertisements, but they considered them a crucial, vital source of information.  Whenever I teach the early America and antebellum periods, even the colonial world, it's not just the English colonies and the present day United Sates, it's the French colonies, the British colonies, the Spanish colonies they all have runaway advertisements.  And it was a great mistake of slave owners.  As historians we are so thankful that they have these runaway slave advertisements because they're undeniable proof of slave resistance for sure.  But they're also, I view them, as mini-biographies and they provide incredible physical descriptions of slaves, any scars they might have, whether their teeth had been filed down or rotted out, their hairstyles.  In Pensacola there were runaway slaves with tattoos because they had served in the U.S. Navy. It's really pretty mind blowing.  Many years ago, ten to fifteen years ago, when I first was browsing 1820-1830 addition of the <i>Pensacola Gazette</i> microfilm for a lecture I was working on and what blew my mind--and I was very familiar these advertisements all over the Atlantic world particularly in the antebellum South, but what blew my mind regarding the <i>Pensacola Gazette</i> was one of the very first--maybe the first issue--I ever saw there were eight runaway slave advertisements on the front page of their local newspaper.  Pensacola never numbered more than a couple of hundred or just 1000, maybe 2000 people, in the early 19th century.  And for you to have eight runaway advertisements and a total of fifteen runaway slaves, proportionally, that's an incredible number.  As I remember being on the microfilm machine I went from issue, to issue, to issue and it didn't change; and, and six months later there were six runaway slave ads on the front page.  Over the course of twenty, thirty, forty years, it's almost impossible to find an issue of the <i>Gazette</i> that doesn't have a runaway slave ad.  So I'd make the argument that if you want to understand specifically Pensacola history during this time period you cannot ignore these runaway slave ads.  Not only can you not ignore them but you have to make sense of them.  I teach students all the time when you write a paper, or do research, you really want to make it primary source driven, something original, something new.  Secondary sources are great, and you can have the greatest topic, but if you can't find a primary source then you're going to have a difficult time and this is a perfect example of me just stumbling across these advertisements and the lightbulb went off above my head like I got to tell this story.  No one's told this story, no one's really considered these sources and maybe they did for New York City, but they didn't do it for the Deep South.  I just took the ball and ran with it, so it's awesome as a historian to have the topic, or the thesis, grab you and you feel like the you're vehicle to tell the story but you're not really doing it, it's the sources telling their own story. </p>           <p>CWBR:  With these sources I found it interesting because looking at it from slave advertisements, you're able to see U.S. officials throughout the early and antebellum period considered the national project as one committed to the spread of an empire of liberty.  So how did Pensacola's place in the Atlantic world and along the Southern frontier suggest that liberty was far from the United States' national project?  And here I'm thinking especially of the role of Britain, which often found itself protecting or trying to expand the freedom/autonomy bonds people secured for themselves or the actions. </p>               <p>MC:  I would definitely contend that there may have been from Thomas Jefferson down, an argument to be an empire of liberty, but as Adam Rothman and others have shown, that what really happens late 18th early 19th century, at least in the Southwest all the way to Texas, is certainly the complete opposite.  And it's an empire of slavery concerned with making money and profit at the expense of African American slaves.  It's a brutal narrative, it's hard to discuss and talk about, but it's a vital piece of American history.  In those very pivotal years, you see slavery take deep hold across the southern United States and we all know how it ends in the civil sectionalism and Civil War etc.  The thing about Pensacola is it's Spanish officially until 1821, so Spain and the Spanish colonies vary in their degrees of racial thinking, of racism, of laws.  But certainly on the Spanish frontier of Cuba and Spanish Florida the laws were very lax regarding slavery.  Slavery existed in great numbers, and to a great extent, but laws existed where Spanish slaves were still recognized as human beings.  They're not considered chattel and they are legally owned by someone, but they have legal redress and church redress.  So there are options for African descended people in the Spanish world that are not available in the British world and eventually the American world.  Pensacola has this heritage that doesn't fade and one of the neatest things I've ever found about Pensacola is during the American Civil War in the 1860s there is still, forty years after annexation by the United States, there's a former Spanish diplomat who lives in Pensacola and when the Union troops invade the town he puts his Spanish flag above his house.  So forty years after Spain has forfeited it's claim to Pensacola there are still residents there who have that cultural heritage of maybe not being as racialized as their English or American neighbors, that's a very important thing.  I think you have this empire of slavery, it sweeps over Pensacola in the early 1800s, mainly it's Andrew Jackson, the War of 1812, and the Seminole War etc.--Andrew Jackson was a big agent in all this change.  Then after the war ended, and you get into the 1820s and 1830s, you have a real struggle of slave owners who are authorized by the law and government to spread their way of life, which is slavery and white supremacy, and to imprint it on Pensacola.  And make no mistake about it they try to make Pensacola just as racialized, just as unequal, just as slave based as every port town in the South.  I would argue, however, they're not very successful.  They're certainly successful to some extent, slavery is legalized and existed through the Civil War.  That being said, the number of fugitive slaves demonstrates that it wasn't a complete victory for slave-owners and their way of thinking.  You had mentioned the British, Britain and the United States, during the Age of Revolution, had a little game of back and forth where they both tried to prove which were the real freedom fighters.  You see it in the American Revolution with Dunmore's Proclamation, you see it in the War of 1812 with Cochrane's several proclamations for Indians and slaves to get their freedom, to get land, get all sorts of stuff for joining the British.  And certainly from the point of view of Pensacola's history it's the British who are the freedom fighters.  Now you can find other places where the British are anything but freedom loving people regarding African American slaves.  But from Pensacola's point of view and black Pensacola's point of view during the American Revolution, during the War of 1812, the British are their allies and that will only change when the British depart follow
ng the War of 1812. </p>                <p>CWBR:  Tell us a little about Negro Fort, which was a military outpost constructed by fugitive slaves, between Pensacola and St. Augustine.  And if you would, describe its community and what it represented to slaveholders looking in from the outside.</p>             <p>MC:  I'm glad you mention that because it's the next book I'm wrapping up now, it's a narrative account of Negro Fort because it's distressing as a historian when you read that story and it's only in the last ten years since the first monograph on it just came out a couple of years ago.  When you hear that story and you realize it's not in any textbook, that no American students have been taught about Negro Fort since the early 19th century, it's mind blowing--no pun intended because the Fort is ultimately blown to smithereens.  But for people who don't know, during the War of 1812 the British, mostly of out desperation began offering slaves freedom if they would join the British marines.  The Colonial Marines they were called.  That being said there were many British soldiers, officers in particular who became abolitionists, as we would call them today.  I'm not sure we'd exactly term them as that but they were anti-slavery on an interracial level.  They embraced slaves who joined the regiments; and, so what happens during the War of 1812--everyone increasingly knows about this happening in Maryland, Virginia, and Washington D.C.--but it also all over Florida and Georgia.  Ultimately in the War of 1812, the British recruited several hundred black [men] slaves mostly from Florida, but also from the southern frontier of the United States.  They flocked to Pensacola, Port St. Joe, to wherever the British were and ultimately the British move them to a place on the Apalachicola River maybe twenty miles from the Gulf of Mexico.  These slaves and Indians build a very massive fort, pretty much the largest man made the structure between Pensacola and St. Augustine.  Ultimately there is a brigade there of about 200 soldiers, and that's in 1813/1814, and ultimately in 1815 when the British evacuated Florida they left not just the 200 British Colonial Marines--these black soldiers in the Fort but also their families--and increasingly hundreds and hundreds of slaves from Spanish Florida and the southern United States flocked to this sanctuary.  For at least a year, you have a free black community living in Spanish Florida and they're self-sufficient.  They're hunting, fishing, trading with the handful of Indians there, and maybe most importantly, the military arsenal they had there was unthinkable for the time.  Never in the history of the world have hundreds and hundreds of fugitive slaves been given the arsenal they had.  Not to mention they stole so many boats and ships from Pensacola, and other southern port towns, they also had like an informal navy.  These slaves they got on the water and controlled the Apalachicola River from the American border down to the Gulf of Mexico.  So it really is, in the history of American slavery, an incredible symbol of black freedom and for me it was unbelievably interesting because ultimately there were just a handful of guys who controlled this fort.  And the lieutenants, colonels, and the Colonial Marines, in the Fort were from Pensacola.  Some of them we don't think were born in Pensacola. They probably came from Louisiana.  There is a man in charge at one point his name is Garcon, a French name, and they referred to him as a French Negro, so we could suspect he's definitely from New Orleans, maybe he's from Haiti originally, and perhaps knew about the Haitian Revolution.  It's just at the tail end of the Age of Revolution, you have these black soldiers in Negro Fort and they're willing to fight to the death and ultimately Andrew Jackson -- really without governmental approval -- he Oks Edmund Gaines and it's a joint of Army-Navy operation.  They attacked the fort from the north and south.  Very few Americans fought in the so called battle of Negro Fort, but hundreds of Creek Indians joined the Americans and they battled with the slaves for several days.  When it's all set and done about five U.S. soldiers were killed. We don't have any statistics on the Indian casualties, but then the fort is blown to smithereens.  And it's debatable, did 100 slaves die? 300? We're not sure.  We know a lot of slaves escaped before the ultimate explosion but that is, I would argue, a very important turning point in the history of American slavery because for a while there was hope for fugitive slaves.  As late as 1816 if you can get to Negro Fort you could be free and once that fort is destroyed for southern slaves their prospects of freedom have just decreased exponentially.  So I do think it's a very important moment in time that we need to do a better job of educating people about. </p>         <p>CWBR:  As you mentioned earlier there's a lot of people who escaped from Negro Fort.  So in spite of national and local governments endorsement of slavery, and the legal protections offered to slave-owners, what factors strengthened interracial alliances throughout Florida's territorial period leading up to the Civil War?  And if you could take a moment what type of people helped fugitive slaves during the territorial period? </p>        <p>MC:  I think we mentioned the frontier and the geography for sure but I also think it's just economic.  What you're going to have for the most part is a lower class/working class alliance.  And in Pensacola, like many southern port towns, you have black slaves working side by side with free white men and often times they have the same positions, trades, and skillset.  Having those similar occupations will convince you very easily that you two are equal.  As I mentioned before, the law might say or recognize you as being very unequal, a slave owner may recognize you as being unequal but for the workers they look at each other, possibly depending on the climate culturally and socially speaking, you see it on occasion these men look at each other as equal.  They go to these liquor stores, taverns at 3 o'clock in the morning and they're drinking and doing all these things they shouldn't be doing at 3 o'clock in the morning, but race doesn't seem to matter here.  As I mentioned before, typically when people discuss interracialism and when they point to it, they point to elite white northerners and poor black slaves from the south.  What I find in Pensacola is working class whites, working class blacks seeing themselves as a collective group as late as the Civil War.  One thing that is very important to this whole thing is the U.S. military and I'm certainly one of the historians who argues that the U.S. military has a pivotal role in building an empire of slavery.  The military puts down slave revolts, the military/navy is used to return fugitive slaves to their owners.  There is no denying that the federal government is very much involved in spreading slavery, yet in Pensacola you find the opposite.  You see that for sure, but you also see something else that's oppositional where you have, in Pensacola, a labor shortage with so few workers that slaves are forced to do everything.  But what's fascinating are these leased slaves, they've been leased to the military, they don't live with their owners.  Often times their owners are in New Orleans.  They don't live anywhere near their owners, and so they live in a military town, they work at the Pensacola Navy yard, or work at one of the adjacent forts--they live in barracks for goodness sake with white sailors.  So is it any surprise that they work together all day, drink together in the evening, sleep in the same government funded building and they both, free white workers and black slaves, at the navy yard get healthcare for goodness sake in the territorial state period.  There are all these powerful forces trying to convince these people that they're actually kind of equal.  And one of the neatest things I found, there's many things I found fascinating, is that there's anecdotal evidence/testimony that in Pensacola, because of the power of the Federal Government, that slave testimony was allowed throughout the territorial antebellum periods when it was not even thinkable elsewhere.  Unlike most parts of the South, for a slave to testify against a white person, a black cook on a U.S. naval ship or some sort of black enlisted man on a U.S. naval ship, he was allowed to testify against whites in the early 1800s.  So there's an example of the U.S. military if anything, subverting, white supremacy and the institution of slavery.  So for me that really demonstrates a Pensacola exceptionalism that you just don't find anywhere else, or if you do find it in another military town it's a very rare occurrence. </p>        <p>CWBR:  Your book also argues that Pensacola served as the southern line of the Underground Railroad so can you describe that a bit?  And talk about some of the more prominent conductors on this southern line of the Underground Railroad. </p>         <p>MC:  Right, and this where you get to what is your definition of the Underground Railroad?  For some people it's a strict constructionist argument where the Underground Railroad is an organized network of people predominantly in the North and they orchestrate the escape of slaves to the North and Canada.  Tom, I just don't see it like that, and quite frankly a lot of people don't anymore.  Even slaves who are assisted by organized abolition groups in the North by the 1830s/40s/50s often get to the North on their own.  They escape by themselves or with family members or friends.  They have no help, no assistance and if they're lucky enough by the grace of God to make it to the upper south or to cross the Ohio River to cross the Mason-Dixon Line, then and only then, can they anticipate having someone help them.  You got to be careful when talking about the Underground Railroad, people want to think that abolitionists, normally they picture a white man almost going into the South and helping slaves escape, and that just almost doesn't happen.  So Pensacola really helps us redefine the Underground Railroad, and what I find, like you said there are sort of two types.  You have a slave who gets on a boat in Pensacola and gets out of town and he doesn't care where you take him and how you get him out.  And people who are allowing slaves to get on their boat and stow away; and, I'm sure sometimes they don't know it but there's too many examples of people knowing.  People being hauled to court because they help slaves escape from Pensacola and these aren't card carrying members of abolition societies.  Sometimes they're ship captains so desperate for a crew that they will accept anybody, black or white, free or enslaved.  They're subverting slavery but they're not abolitionists, so I see that a lot.  Typically, in Pensacola that's what you have, slaves working alongside people on the docks who, through some combination of charisma and luck, talk their way onto a ship and they never return to Pensacola.  And much less common you do have several people from the North who are crazy enough to risk their own lives to help slaves escape.  The most famous example is Jonathan Walker.  He's a white ship captain from New Bedford, Massachusetts which is the Mecca of the Underground Railroad in the North.  He's a poor man and he reminds me of John Brown.  He ends up on the Gulf of Mexico--he's in Mobile, Pensacola, New Orleans, he's back and forth.  He's even on the eastern shore of Mexico for a while.  Eventually he ends up working for a railroad company in Pensacola and he leases, or his employer leases slaves, to work on the railroad and Jonathan Walker is tasked with being the overseer, or employer, of these black men.  And he's pretty much run out of town because he treats these black men as equal.  He pays them equally, he welcomes them to his house, they dine at his kitchen table with his wife and children.  On the weekends they hang out, they go to the same church, they sit under trees and just have long conversations; and, ultimately four of these slaves ask him to help them escape.  On the day of the escape several more show up and so Walker and all these slaves get on a boat--they all worked at the U.S. Navy yard--and they try to make their way to the Bahamas.  So here's another example, they're not trying to get to Canada or the North, they're trying to get to any place that may welcome these people as free men.  And as they get to Key West, they were less than a day away from their destination when they were in fact caught by a wrecking ship that reported it to a U.S. Naval captain close by who brought them back to Pensacola.  So to answer your question I think there's ordinary men who work on the water that help these slaves escape, but definitely every once in a while you find an actual abolitionist who happens to be in Pensacola and when the opportunity arises he helps the slaves to escape.  I will mention one last name: Columbus Jones.  I make a big deal about Columbus Jones because he is the most typical of slaves who tried to escape on the Underground Railroad.  He gets on a boat, again he works at the U.S. Navy yard, and it's possible the black crew welcomed him onboard. It's even possible the captain escorted him to New England knowing he was escaping. But when he gets to Massachusetts and a lot of stuff happens, all hell breaks loose, the law gets involved, the captain is put in jail, there's a fight on the ship, and Columbus Jones is ultimately captured and returned to Pensacola.  But moral of the story is when he was in New England abolitionists did everything in their power to help this guy win his freedom.  But this help only came weeks after he risked his life to get on a boat and travelled more than a thousand miles.  So the Underground Railroad is a complex thing and to define it is just as difficult as defining race and interracialism. </p>        <p>CWBR:  How did the Civil War produce a set of circumstances both familiar, and different, for fugitive slaves?  And, how did the Civil War differ from other conflicts in the opportunities, and risks, it provided for both fugitive slaves and their southern allies? </p>        <p>MC:  During the American Revolution, or any place there's war and instability, conflict added a tendency to spark slave unrest because there's an opportunity to be seized. So certainly in the American Revolution you see a spike in the number of fugitive slaves, but what's unique about the American Revolution is never at any point during that conflict in Pensacola did either of the warring parties offer freedom to slaves officially.  So what then stands out is both the War of 1812 and the American Civil War, where you have invading parties that are literally offering freedom to anyone who can escape and reach their lines -- if you're a young military aged man join the armed services.  In the War of 1812 you have the British under Alexander Cochrane, there's lieutenant colonel Edward Nichols, there's a guy named George Woodbine and it's official British policy that fugitive slaves will be given their freedom and guns and uniforms if they so desire.  Same thing in the American Civil War, it takes a couple of years, but by 1863 any fugitive slave in South that joins and fights in the U.S. armed services will become free men, so it's really similar in that regard.  The huge difference, however, is the British will lose the War of 1812, they don't hold onto Pensacola--now hundreds of slaves will escape from Pensacola--but it's a whole different ballgame in the Civil War where the Union Army is going to win this war and slavery is going to be extinguished across the entire United States.  So when slaves see the opportunity during the Civil War, the numbers are even greater and the results are incredibly greater to the benefit of slaves.  So the Civil War is this unbelievably violent episode, and you don't want to romanticize it, but for slaves just as it had been during the War of 1812, it's an opportunity to win your freedom.  And if you know the story, and the history of American slavery, those opportunities rarely if any exist.

6418	9780674737259	$29.95	CWBR Author Interview:  This Vast Southern Empire: Slaveholders at the Helm of American Foreign Policy		Karp, Matthew			"Interview with Matthew Karp, author of <i>This Vast Southern Empire: Slaveholders at the Helm of American Foreign Policy </i>  Interviewed by Tom Barber<p></p><p>Civil War Book Review (CWBR): Today the Civil War Book Review is happy to speak with Matthew Karp, Assistant Professor of History at Princeton University.  Today we get to discuss his new book <i>This Vast Southern Empire: Slaveholders at the Helm of American Foreign Policy</i>.</p><p>Matthew Karp (MK): Hi, thanks for interviewing me.  I'm happy to be here. </p><p>CWBR: Your book focuses heavily on the 1830s, 40s, and 50s. Why did U.S. slaveholders need a foreign policy in the three decades before the Civil War?  What was it about this period that placed slaveholding elites at the center of U.S. foreign policy? </p><p>MK: It's an interesting question.  I think in some ways it's not a distinctive period in terms of slaveholders actually being in power or managing U.S. foreign relations.  If you think about the period before, slaveholders predominated as presidents and exercised proportionate control over all sorts of branches of governments including foreign relations.  What is different for me and why I concentrate on this period before the Civil War is a couple things, first, internationally the abolition of slavery in the British West-Indies in 1833 is the turning point that gets the boat going.  I think that really changes the hemispheric/global balance of power between freedom and slavery.  When you have the world's largest naval and economic power that has gone from being a slave holding power up until 1833 to effectively antislavery.  And that puts slave property in the United States in jeopardy in an international/geopolitical way that it hadn't been.  So that's the international context that made slaveholders, and maybe we can talk more about this, but makes slaveholders who had been in power before more attentive to the international balance of power between slaveholding societies and antislavery societies.  I also think the development of a domestic pro-slavery ideology which evolves at home and really reaches a height in the 1840s and 50s separates that period from the earlier periods.  It's not necessarily that slaveholders weren't in power in the era of Jefferson or Madison, but these guys weren't committed to an ideological, defense of slavery, even ideological exuberance about slavery, that I think characterizes the period right before the Civil War. </p><p>CWBR:  You talk a lot about this pro-slavery hemisphere in the Americas, so why did the global health of slavery prove so critical for its domestic health in the United States? </p><p>MK: That's sort of the way slaveholders started to think about it after Britain began the process of emancipation in 1833.  These guys, Southern elites and political figures, we tend to think of them sometimes as provincial and inward looking, especially the Antebellum generation before the Civil War.  In some ways that reflects the legacy of their defeat in the war and the post war South; which was a much more inward looking place in terms of its politics.  It had few claims on national power and was mostly focused on preserving its local power or its regional power.  But before the Civil War these slaveholders, from Andrew Jackson to Jefferson Davis, the generation that I study, they were at the helm of the United States national government.  So their view of slavery, like their view of pretty much everything, operated with a presumption that the power and national vista of the United States either geopolitically or ideologically was under their command.  Or at least they would have decisive roles in directing US foreign policies.  So when Britain abolishes slavery or slavery comes under threat in Cuba, Texas or Brazil, it's not just that slaveholders felt allegiance to other slaveholding classes outside of the United States, they felt able through their influence and power within the American state, within the national government to contest that and defend slavery internationally.  So it's not just about their desire, but also their capacity being so powerfully placed within the federal government. </p>  <p>CWBR:  You mentioned the popular image of slaveholders not really meeting the reality of what they're actually thinking about in Antebellum America and in the book you call slaveholding elites in the United States cosmopolitans so can you go into that?  What do you mean by you have these slaveholders that are cosmopolitan?  What are their ideas?  Where are they getting them from?  And what makes them cosmopolitan? </p>  <p>MK:  There are a number of ways, on one level somebody like the story of Michael O'Brien is written as a two volume, thousand-page history on intellectual life in the Antebellum South focusing on novelist like William Gilmore Sims or a pro-slavery, legal theorists like Abel Upshur or Nathaniel Beverly Tucker.  And a lot of the same characters reoccur in my book and yeah they read European thinkers from the Enlightenment and the early modern classics from Lock to Voltaire.  I think what separates the way that I handle this cosmopolitanism in the book is that these guys were also wielding political power.  It's not just that the figures that I've named for instance like Abel Upshur could speak foreign languages, and would cite an international lawyer like Grotius, in a treatise on the Constitution, but that he was also Secretary of State who organized the early critical stages of the annexation of Texas.  So there is a marriage between an intellectual system that I think intellectual historians of the South have started to dig up that these guys weren't illiterate, the elite upper stratum in any case.  Where I go with it is that they had real political power.  And so, in the 1850s especially, that means they're looking abroad actively at current events and world politics and even some intellectual trends like the rise of racial science in Europe and in the North and seeing these international intellectual currents as vindication for their own slave system. </p> <p>CWBR:  Right!  You have a great part in the book where you talk about how slaveholders, and this slaveholding ideology in the United States, didn't see itself as antithetical to the modern world.  If you could explain this phrase that I thought was both great but unnerving.  You call one particular character a pro-slavery futurist. Could you talk about that and this nature of pro-slavery futurism? </p><p>MK: A lot of these guys had visions of slavery's future.  I think I might have been talking about James D.B. De Bow, editor of <i>Debow's Review</i>, which was the largest and most influential periodical in the South, and he routinely includes statistical charts that would project the slave population into 1900.  At one point I think they had an estimate of X million amount of slaves in 1950.  There was certainly enormous confidence in the future not just existence of slavery but its growth and its ongoing dynamism.  And I think that's connected to the last question.  I think it is informed by this belief, that if you think about the 19th century world, even though antislavery politics has been gaining power--especially in the north with the rise of the Republican Party and even in Europe to a certain extent after British abolition and with some continental European emancipations in the wake of the 1848 Revolutions. Politics was moving in an antislavery direction but a lot of the intellectual vanguard self-identified by the South is moving toward the racial science that would dominate not really southern circles but North American and European universities for the next 50-75 years.  This was just beginning in the 1850s.  Southerners like Alexander Stevens, Vice President of the Confederacy, really leapt on this and cited figures like the French thinkers Gobineau or Harvard anthropologist Louis Agassiz Harvard anthropologist etc. as unbiased.  These guys weren't defenders of slavery, these northerners and Europeans, but they were committed to racial inequality and they believe that it had a scientific warrant.  Slaveholding politicians really pounced on that and it infused them with confidence that as much as antislavery politics had some momentum, ultimately there was a countercurrent.  George Fitzhugh, the Virginian intellectual, described it as a countercurrent, that in intellectual life and in the deeper understanding of human cultures and biological capacities that was evolving in this period was pointing towards a form of racial inequality and even hierarchy and domination that characterized the slave system and would sustain it into the future.  And in some creepy senses that I find disturbing, they're right in that racial science does flourish and grow long after the destruction of slavery and if slavery hadn't been destroyed in the course of this war, I think it is possible to imagine an ideological congruence between slavery and more fully developed racial sciences of late 19th and early 20th centuries, which is disturbing to contemplate. </p>      <p>CWBR:  Since you've talked about the intellectual motivations and what's going on with slaveholders can you talk about geographically what did this vast empire look like and what tools did these southerners in power in the U.S. national government use to fortify their control of U.S. foreign policy and expand it? </p><p>MK:  That's a good observation that the book really has two sides.  Sometimes I think about it that way, in that one chunk of it or two ways of thinking about slaveholders in power, the first is the more intellectual ideological view of situations of slavery's place in an evolving and contested 19th century world politics and the second scene which maybe gets even more space in the book is actually what they were doing and not just their ideas, but their practices.  One thing that I'll talk about now is the way that slaveholders were committed to the peace time reform of expansion of the U.S. Military and the U.S. Navy that I think informed by an international and ideological calculus in which led them to see the United States as the hemispheric chief defender of slave property and slave systems.  That intellectual calculus, or ideological calculus, helped fortify southern belief in strengthening U.S. Military power.  Even though to some extent it clashed with a traditional commitment to states' rights or a weaker federal government that characterized the politics of someone like John C. Calhoun who was very wary of an empowered national government in domestic affairs,  but when it came to foreign policy, and especially the foreign policy of slavery, was a champion of naval expansion.  Abel Upshur who I mentioned earlier, a constitutional theorist who ends up as Secretary of the Navy in the early 1840s proposes and partially achieves a massive and unprecedented naval expansion and reorganization intended in his mind and in the mind of people like Calhoun to contest British power on the American Coast, Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean.  This was to help protect potentially vulnerable slaveholding society in Cuba and also certainly Texas.  So those are basically the two main geopolitical themes, expansion and reform of U.S. military and the navy.  Jefferson Davis does this similar thing to the US army in the 1850s.  And also diplomatic links and connections and shared geopolitical objectives with the other major slaveholding societies in the hemisphere which really are Brazil, Cuba and the republic of Texas. </p>  <p>CWBR:  So what you're saying is basically by the mid-19th century the world seems on a tipping point between these two ideologies.  Between free labor, that is represented in and upheld by Britain, an imperial abolition as you call it and a slaveholding, bounded regime of labor.  Could you talk a little bit about how slaveholders in the United States looked at colonialism throughout Europe?  And as it begins to develop in the 40s and 50s, how did they integrate Europe becoming more colonial especially Britain? </p><p>MK:  Yeah that's another parallel with their excitement about the direction of this racist science.  Their more ambivalent about this, but ultimately I think they see it as a phenomenon that will strengthen their view of culture and politics and society, which is the advance of European imperialism in Africa, Asia, and all around the world.  Southerners are often very critical of the abuses of British imperial power, in particular.  Yet at the same time someone like Edmund Ruffin who's pro-slavery and really skeptical of antislavery Great Britain still cheers on the British suppression of the Indian mutiny of 1857 which is the most notable anti-imperial struggle of this period.  He's very excited about it because he thinks ultimately the interest of civilization require that this master race or the white race be dominate.  That means suppressing anti colonial resistance.  I think the way that they conceive of European Imperialism is very much in terms of linked ideas of race and coerced labor.  This informs their attitude towards what people in the period referred to as coolie labor.  The importation of Asian apprentice workers to serve on sugar plantations and work on railroads in the United States.  Southerners are really attuned to the abuses of the system in the way that it is unlike their paternalistic system of slavery and yet at the same time they interpret the European powers embrace of ""coolie labor"" as an admission that free labor, unbounded, non-coercive wage labor is doomed in competition with coerced labor.  Especially when it comes to producing really critical, tropical staples or doing jobs that free labor just doesn't do as well (cotton, sugar, tobacco).  All over the world there is a tropical agriculture that's necessary to sustain and to fuel the Industrial Revolution.  They don't believe free labor can accomplish that, especially white free labor.  And it's absolutely necessary as they fear the Europeans are beginning to become aware of this with their use of bonded coercive, racially organized labor in a way that parallels slavery and I think they think ultimately we'll revert to slavery or something indistinguishable to slavery. </p><p>CWBR:  A couple of questions, so how do you explain, because in the book you have this great part about how many of these slaveholders even though they were against free labor they were very much for free trade, how did this work?  How did they reconcile being free trade and against free labor, why weren't those synonymous? </p><p>MK:  That's a confusion that sometimes crops into historical thinking about the 19th century because if you think about it, I leased it in British terms.  People like Richard Cobden or John Bright are great advocates of free trade and opposition to aristocratic protectionism and corn laws and so on and they are also great champions of free labor.  Those things naturally in an emerging capitalist economy might seem to go together.  But yes, in fact southerners prove very capable of dividing the two and arguing that the demands of this emerging global capitalistic economy did insist on free trade.  As they saw it the 19th century a lot of Britain had successfully persuaded and cajoled a lot of other European countries, South American countries, and Asian countries to drop slave protections and tariffs and other restrictions really in the service of a British dominated world economy that served Britain above all other places.  Southerners were fine with that because they believe the free intercourse of goods across borders ultimately will A) enrich a vast majority of southern cotton planters and B) ideologically it was compatible with their sense of a world development.  But that did not mean that labor should be free.  It's really fascinating.  You can say some things about the way southerners understood this distinction and its implications for the insert of capitalism probably and its many permutations because while they embrace this international trade element of the picture they utterly rejected the idea that laborers/workers should be guaranteed any rights or freedoms in producing goods.  In fact they understood the production of agricultural staples just simply required coercion.  As 
vidence of that they pointed to the quote on quote failure of emancipation in the British West Indies and other emancipated West Caribbean places where exports really dropped after the emancipation of slaves because former slaves didn't want to work for miserable wages on a sugar plantation when they could cultivate a wider range of goods on their own. Southerners said well the world needs these goods and free labor market won't provide them so in the interest of free trade the good labor needs to be coerced.  This is the result they arrived at. </p>     <p>CWBR:  Our typical narrative of going to Civil War in the beginning of the American Civil War usually begins with the Crisis of the 1850s or that's where many historians point to and I'm talking here about Kansas-Nebraska, Bleeding Kansas, fugitive slave law, and the Compromise of 1850.  Now how did the notion, and desire for, hemispheric slavery exacerbate the sectional crises of the 1850s and take us to the Civil War, more specifically the Compromise? </p>  <p>MK:  The book doesn't really go into the war itself but I do have a chapter on succession and certainly the politics of the 1850s play a really important role in the second half of the book.  I think, yeah domestic narrative is really critical. I certainly wouldn't want to be seen as arguing that really it was fundamentally about foreign policy, and that the extension of slavery into the territories was very well just as important because I still think that is the most important issue in the rise of the Republican Party and the ultimate secession.  That still leaves us with a problem.  The problem with succession, which can be over explained because it ends up being such a catastrophic decision for the slaveholders the ruin, the destruction of their independent nation, the ruin of their social system, their demotion from national power which last about one hundred years.  It's so catastrophic and saw so clearly foreseen to have been catastrophic by a lot of people at the time.  So why did they do it?  There are a lot of explanations to that but the book argues that there were both push and pull factors that were really critical in fundamentally involved foreign policy.  They were pushed out of the Union, when we think about the long history of slaveholder's domination of not just the presidency and Supreme Court but also the offices in the executive branch devoted to foreign affairs.  When we think about how the new Republican administration in the 1860s just wipes out the entire apparatus of this pro-slavery state that they had built, it deepens our sense of how rapidly they lose a key plank of their power, and how terrified they are of the prospect of the Republicans, not just potentially undermining slavery where it exist or restricting it from expansion, but by turning this whole outward apparatus of the state against slavery all over the world and further constricting southern slaveholders in the Union.  What I think is even more important than that is the pull factor, this sort of lore of an independent nation.  Even though these guys were fundamentally, the book argues nationalist rather than sectionalist.  Once they lose any stake in the national government they're confident, confident about the future of slavery and that slavery is ideologically congruent and compatible with the directions of world history as we talked about science, colonialism, the global market place all mean that slavery has a seat at the table.  And slavery as an effect will be protected by these global trends and the slaveholding republic also will.  I think what ultimately proves to be a really bad miscalculation geopolitically in terms of they don't secure European assistance, their slave society isn't flexible and strong enough to withstand 4 years of crippling war.  But I think that confidence can only be understood in its international dimensions.  Since you mentioned it, the key moment in the negotiations before the South ultimately secedes is a debate about the extended line between freedom and slavery at 36' 30 all the way across the west free slaves up north, slave states in the south.  Southerners are willing to accept this because it would of been ultimately a continuation of the antebellum republic.  Republicans would of been the ones who would have to overhaul the planks of their entire platform to accept it.  Where southerners ultimately bail is when Republicans reject the whole Compromise but the key point of contention all territory here after required potential new slave territories in the Caribbean and in Latin America.  Southerners even if they aren't keen on acquiring those territories right away, and many are, but even the ones that aren't because a lot of the Virginians weren't keen on that they still saw the possibility of future slave expansion as something that was fundamental to their power and to sort of accept the ultimate restriction of that forever is really accepting slavery and slaveholders as occupying a secondary place in the republic.  Which is not where it had been the previous 80 years and not something they were willing to do.  They really did need to rule or risk ruin and that's the decision they made in '61. </p>  <p>CWBR:  James Oakes said that they saw the ""Cordon of Freedom"" wrapping around them to maintain the ability to expand even if they didn't want it initially. </p><p>MK:  Right exactly, I think we can absolutely think about that cordon in international terms too.  Not just, would they get Cuba but what Oakes talked about in terms of what Lincoln does during the 1860s.  In terms of outlawing slavery in the forts and SC and opening the relations with Haiti all that kind of foreign policy dimension too that kind of cordon of freedom politics is something slaveholders was very aware of in '60/'61 and saw as essentially this whole powerful state they built was being turned against them. </p><p>CWBR: I appreciate you taking the time to chat with us about your most recent work: <i>This Vast Southern Empire: Slaveholders at the Helm of American Foreign Policy</i>.</p><p>MK: Thank you for having me.</p>

6580	252082249	$24.93	The Loyal West: Civil War and Reunion in Middle America		Stanley, Matthew			"Interview with Matthew Stanley, author of <i>The Loyal West: Civil War and Reunion in Middle America</i>  Interviewed by Tom Barber<p></p><p>CWBR: Today the Civil War Book Review is pleased to speak with Matthew E. Stanley, assistant professor of history at Albany State University in Albany, Georgia. Today we are here to talk with him about his new book, <i>The Loyal West: Civil War and Reunion in Middle America</i>. Professor Stanley, thank you for joining us today.</p><p>Matthew Stanley (MS): Thanks for having me Tom.</p><p>CWBR: So, your book looks at what we think of today as the mid-west by examining the cultural and intellectual significance of place, race, and memory.</p> <p>So, we'll begin with place. Where was the middle west geographically? And how did it become a place in the American imagination before the Civil War?</p><p>MS: Yeah, so the book is talking about the sense of region literally and how regions become sections. So, when I think of regions, I'm talking about a sense of common culture based on geography, kinship, commercial ties--things of that nature. What becomes the Midwest, which is a term that actually isn't in popular usage until the early twentieth century, begins as a the middle north-west first, as the west generally--but when I talk about the middle west, what I'm really talking, and I focus in on in my book, are Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and what becomes the Midwest. These regional designations, are pretty fluid and pretty fast and loose. So, in thinking about the transformation from region into section throughout most of the book.</p> <p>CWBR: How did these folks living in the Midwest, or the middle west, before the Civil War--how did they see themselves? How did their place geographically, affect their identity before war breaks out?</p><p>MS: Well the people I'm writing about primarily in southern Ohio, southern Indiana, and southern Illinois and some extent Kentucky, across the Ohio river, would not have called themselves Northerners, which had a distinct, most of the time, had distinct political implication. They certainly wouldn't have thought of themselves as Yankees, which had a specific political and cultural meaning as well. They often thought of themselves as westerners. To be a westerner meant to some degree, whether through popular sovereignty or compromise measures, some degree of compatibility between slavery and freedom. And it was, like I said, it was a term that was used in very fast and loose ways. So, Chicagoans referred to themselves as westerners. So, it encapsulated a region that spanned from the Great Lakes, and probably the epicenter, being the Ohio River Valley and would go into the border South and even south of that sometimes, Arkansas--Mississippians even would refer to themselves as westerners. But this was a term that was used, in addition to and was often synonymous with the idea border people or central people, they would call themselves the middle states. Meaning that there was a degree of them thinking of themselves as being a section or a region of the country that was not the North, not the South, but the idea of them of having their own political interests in the West, and as we know those west--middle west political interests began to shift rapidly once the Civil War began to align with those of the North and the Northeast.</p> <p>CWBR: Even though they didn't consider themselves Northern or Yankee or even Southern, they did still identify with institution of slavery. Can you explain how that works, if they're thinking of themselves culturally as different than both the regions that we come to think of the United States before the Civil War? How did they reconcile this notion of being western and also accepting slavery?</p><p>MS: Right, when I talk about upland southerners, or butternuts, being vassals of Southern culture, I don't want to overstate that. They do live in a free region. The states of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois do have racial exclusion laws on the books prior to the Civil War. They retain southern culture and southern politics in some ways, and southern racial sensibilities--that is to say white people who moved north of the Ohio River, but they were not southerners, nor were their political predilections immutable. So, in the lower middle west, conceptions of whiteness, which were formed by distinct experiences of settler/colonialism and racial exclusion, they were shaped discrete conditions of land and labor.</p> <p>This is to say that most people in the antebellum lower middle west had a vested interest in maintaining the South's racial hierarchy. They didn't want slaves, or black people, to move north of the Ohio River. So, there was a cross-class fear for instance that the introduction of African American people into the lower middle west would what they called--this is the term they would use-- ""degrade white labor"" and denigrate social and cultural conditions of the region so white identities as not slaves or not black were shaped less by slave state style racial domination and more by free state style racial aversion. So, for elites that meant that they could use racism to facilitate political hegemony and control labor and for non-elites that meant that they didn't have to compete with black labor for wages or for housing or for land and space.</p><p>CWBR: Now you would think, and your book does a great job about thinking about irony, that this sort of--even if it is not a complete commitment to slavery--that there might be a great deal of sympathy throughout the middle west region before the war for secession, but that isn't what happened. When the South begins to seriously consider leaving the United States, and confronting the problems of the 1850s with expansion and slavery, what happens to the middle west--that your book focuses--why don't they go toward or embrace secession?</p><p>MS: Yeah, because the old idea of western identity is deeply rooted in nationalism. It is also rooted in national expansion, but the secessionist impulse--the idea of challenging the status quo is the kind of thing they are rejecting. It is seen as immoderate, it is seen as just as immoderate as abolitionism, so when they think of themselves as being in the middle, they are not talking about just being westerners as opposed to easterners and southerners or northerners or southerners. They're also thinking about themselves as being within the middle of the west, so they're identifying as the median within the national median, so even among westerners you have this more reform minded, Whiggish, Republican party oriented Great Lakes part of the Midwest, and then through the South you have small or slave holding--in fact as the more South you get more of the plantation complex, so they see themselves as caught between two fires is the phrase one southern Indiana resident uses. That is true not only the West being between the North and the South but also as the lower Midwest or the border between the great lakes and the plantation South.</p>     <p>CWBR: So why then do they, this nationalism you talk about before the war becomes Unionism why does the region--if they are stuck between two fires--what makes unionism and national loyalty more important than perhaps the degradation of white labor. Rephrased, why do they embrace unionism instead of secession?</p><p>MS: To be clear, there are on the margins, secession being discussed by some hardcore copperheads of the region we're talking, who talk about breaking away and forming the state of Jacksonia--it's not ever a serious endeavor. Many of them support union for the same reason other northerners did. It is part of the regional imagination and when you think of  William Henry Harrison, Henry Clay, and Tippecanoe and things that influence the regional mythology they are rooted in unionism and nationalism, even slave holders to the south of the lower mid-west remained loyal to the union too for the same reason, which is because they thought slavery and the status quo would be best preserved within the Union, rather than risking a war and possible chaos or an overturning of the social and economic system. They really just wanted compromise on the whole and that war as the expression goes in the Midwest is a revolution--tricky things happen during war, so in some ways the last part of the free states to get behind the Union cause, but when they did they did so with great vigor.</p><p>CWBR: So, they see Unionism as a way to maintain the status quo, whether that is in terms of politics or labor practices. So that might work well for the first few years of the war but then we come to emancipation and the North and Lincoln emancipating slaves and then integrating them into the U.S. Army, how does this region that wants to keep the status quo, that joined the war in order to keep antebellum America alive and keep those boundaries in place, how do they react to emancipation and how does this start to begin to change how they see themselves and they place they occupy geographically?</p><p>MS: So the perceptions of the South begin to change among Union soldiers very quickly and that accelerates throughout 1862 and 1863. So, you have, in writing about the South, what I call the conservative unionist vision of the South which is to say they begin to exoticize and confederatize the South and talk about how it is a place where poor white people are degraded and it is a spoiled landscape and they begin to think about it in these stark free labor/slave labor terms.  And even for Democrats perpetuating and reinforcing the old free labor Republican party rhetoric of the 1850s which is that slave society just isn't as good as ours. So, you have an acceptance, but it is slow to grow. There are many lower middle western soldiers who never get right with emancipation and I would say the majority come to tolerate it--some embrace it, some reject it altogether--it is not a clean union-to-emancipation narrative among lower middle western soldiers--it is very messy. In the end, there are not as many as wholesale desertions as are threatened--there are a few, but they are the minority. Most lower middle western soldiers come to see emancipation and black enlistment as practical military measures they can accept so long as their communities stay lily white so that is another problem on the homefront, but it is accepted rather than enthusiastically endorsed by most middle lower western soldiers. And that comes to have implications in the post war period as they are remembering the war, emancipation really doesn't factor into that narrative, sometimes at all and certainly there were these secondary things to the political restoration of the union.</p><p>CWBR: Right, so it is after--as the war is taking and in this post war period that a notion of a loyal west takes place. How did this happen and who did it? Who helped create this notion of a loyal west in this post war period?</p><p>MS: Formally it begins with the publication of Barber and Howe's The Loyal West in the time of Rebellion in 1865--a lot of Grand Army of the Republic and union veterans association leaders use some sort of idea of the term after the war, but informally it begins, I would argue, with Union soldiers in the South in Kentucky, in Missouri, and Tennessee who make distinctions and say this idea of a unified antebellum west, which may have worked at one time with regard to political culture even though the unification of the west was much exaggerated and tended to be employed only when it was expedient, but they are beginning to distinguish between not only the west--between loyal and disloyal elements--that thinking of themselves as loyal westerns allows them to keep that regional identity and that competition with and sometimes antipathy toward the East and the Northeast  not only the region, but also the union armies, but it also allows them to embrace the term loyal, which suggests an integration into the nation-state and to separate from them disloyal west of the slave holding south and even Kentucky, which never secedes but many lower middle western soldiers come to view as a hostile and secessionist and treasonous place.</p><p>CWBR: Right, so you brought up the idea of how veterans especially helped create this notion of a loyal west and helped reconfigured political culture. Can you talk about how they do this versus elites who wrote books about this. What was the creation of the loyal west at the ground level, so here I'm talking about the Grand Army of the Republic and other veterans' associations. How did they fold loyalty to the union and this vision of white labor together at the ground level?</p> <p>MS: First let me clarify that the loyal west narrative is the idea that union soldiers from the West were not only merely undefeated in battle or that they were superior soldiers to eastern union soldiers but that they also had superior political military leaders--even though they fought a harder more destructive war in some ways against the Confederacy than the Army of the Potomac--that they didn't necessarily rely on emancipation or black soldiers in order to do this, which is a fiction in itself. But it was sort of this idea of anti-confederate, anti-black, and vaguely anti-northeastern or anti-eastern at the same time and this idea or some basic tenants of this were perpetuated through reunions. I looked at newspaper sources for veterans' reunions, personal documents for veterans of reunion and a lot--probably the motherlode--was veterans' organization meetings. For instance in 1874 in Milwaukee at the Society of the Army of the Tennessee reunion John Pope, an Illinoisan, says ""When the war was over we found that the President of the United States is a western man, the Vice President was a western man, the Speaker of the House a western man, the secretary of treasury a western man, Secretary of War, Secretary of the Interior, Postmaster General, Attorney General and he just goes on down the line and talks about the power of the government in its both civil and military departments had passed into the hands of western men. So he is playing fast and loose with the idea of western, but this encapsulates, as well as any quote, the idea of the loyal west--that the war had been--that they had done the bulk of the fighting--that the Army of the Potomac had only traveled 100 miles effectively between the D.C.-Richmond corridor. Meanwhile the western armies had gone from the southern tip of Illinois through Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Georgia, up through the Carolinas, and ended the war somewhere in North Carolina. So the idea that, I think begins during the war, but you also see in the grand review of the armies at the end of the armies at the end of the war in which the ideas about the distinctions between western and eastern soldiers play out not only in terms of campaign record but also sartorially. You have the rugged, scruffy, hard-worn looking western soldiers versus the more stately, prim and proper eastern soldiers and there is a lot of commentary on that as well.</p><p>CWBR: Now commemoration, and the larger idea of memory, also plays in this post-war period. How did creating monuments to these western figures help-whether it was veterans or politicians, and these private associations of soldiers, how did the creation of monuments help them rewrite history? The actual person, Grant was for emancipation and embraced the major tenants of Republicanism, but as you mention throughout the book it seems that when these ceremonies take place, when middle westerners, especially in the lower middle west, begin to commemorate these war heroes they do so by excluding and excising some of their political sentiment. Can you talk a little bit about that?</p><p>MS: They remember the republican leadership of the war the way people tend to remember things in terms of heritage. It is not about representing the multi-dimensional reality of the figure or the event--it is about picking what you need in that political moment and so for middle western, lower middle westerners especially, that normally means focusing on region and the triumphs of maybe the state or the west itself, but also as you said excising emancipation and emancipationist memory from the monument or the reunion or whatever 
t might be. That is not to say there is a total absence of emancipationist memory in the lower middle west. I can think of several striking examples. For instance, the Soldiers' and Sailors' monument in Indianapolis, the Lovejoy memorial in Alton, Illinois but that normally meant an emphasis, a distinct emphasis on political restoration and oftentimes a reminder where these leaders such as Grant, Sherman, and Lincoln came from.</p><p>CWBR: As you said in the book emancipation, as you said in the book proved to be a ""commemorative void. "" Even though there are commemorations, public ceremonies that remember emancipation and its importance, you also point out too in the book it is not just the creation of the loyal west that you talk about it is also the disintegration of this loyal west. Can you explain how these monuments and commemoration anticipate and perpetuate national reconciliation after the war?</p><p>MS: This is a good question because the way I came this project was actually through an article in Century magazine published in 1888 by a New York veteran named George Kilmer. It was titled The Blue-Gray Reunions Up to This Point or something to that affect and it was a list of all the major Blue-Gray reunions that had taken place up to 1888. In looking at that list, I noticed Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Maryland, Luray, Virginia, Mexico, Missouri, Owensboro, Kentucky, Evansville, Indiana, Cincinnati, Ohio, Louisville, Kentucky, and there was a striking correlation between Blue-Gray Reunions and physical geography of being along the border between North and South. There was, and this is obvious--it would be intuitive for these reunions to start to happen in the geographic middle between north and south--that makes sense--but it also said something about the politics and the culture, I argue, of western or border identity. And I don't focus so much on the Blue-Gray reunion in the east, but the earliest Blue-Gray, and certainly the earliest major ones, happen in the Ohio River Valley. I'm thinking especially of Evansville's 1887 reunion--this was a major event. The Blue-Gray reconcilers or--whether they are reconciling or reuniting we can debate that at a different date--but they do see themselves as being forerunners of a national reunion culture. They see themselves as doing something new as anticipating a wave of Blue-Gray reunions. There is a major Blue-Gray reunion in Evansville in 1887, there is an even bigger one in 1899 in the middle of the celebration of American empire into Latin American and the Pacific, but this gives way and it becomes the forerunner for a larger, more national Blue-Gray reunion culture, especially one centers on the Spanish-American war and culminates at the 1913 Gettysburg reunion. And I argue that the loyal west narrative becomes overcome and forgotten by creating or helping to create a larger Blue-Gray reconciliation narrative. By the beginning of the twentieth century you don't really hear much about the loyal west anymore, you hear a lot about Blue-Gray reconciliation, but the idea of a regional specific western, border, or middle state, reunion culture begins to die out.</p><p>CWBR: Also, too I would imagine the notion of loyalty automatically becomes synonymous with treason--you have to forget loyalty to create a national reunion because secession was about treason, which I thought was a great insight from your book.</p><p>Finally, how does an understanding of the loyal west's rise and fall inform today's political discussions and debates, or does it?</p><p>MS: I think there is a lot to take away in terms of contemporary implications in the realms of racial identity and class and politics. So, you have the debates over Confederate removals stir people in Louisville and Lexington, which of course one of the many ironies of the story was not even a Confederate state. And as evidenced by last year's presidential election, we continue to see patterns of how elites create and wield racist discourses for political and material gain, how racism feeds off of both perceived and real cultural marginalization and economic insecurity. As well as how racialized populism and grievance politics of white, petty-bourgeois, ""forgotten"" Americans in the Midwest still holds sway, so the idea that people being written out of a narrative or being forgotten, especially white grievance politics, that have sort of always existed in American politics, but have been recharged lately through the presidency of Trump as well as led to the election of Trump. You see those kinds of patterns in the story of the loyal west as well.</p> <p>CWBR: Professor Stanley, I appreciate you taking the time to sit and discuss your most recent work <i>The Loyal West: Civil War and Reunion in Middle America</i>.</p><p>MS: Thanks Tom, thanks for having me.</p>     </p>

6347	9780881465617	$29.00	The Second Coming of the Invisible Empire: The Ku Klux Klan of the 1920s		Rawlings, William			"Invisible Empire's Visible Reach in Georgia<p>The Ku Klux Klan, a terrorist group with its origins in the Reconstruction era after the Civil War, reemerged as a wildly popular organization in the 1920s. The Klan's ability to enroll millions of dues-paying Americans in its ranks owed much to the sophisticated marketing techniques the group developed, but its popularity also reflected existing nativist, racist, and patriotic sentiments that were part of mainstream white American culture in the time period.</p><p><i>The Second Coming of the Invisible Empire</i> examines the second phase of the Ku Klux Klan, focusing in particular on the decade of the 1920s. William Rawlings generally follows a chronological approach in the work, beginning with the emergence of the Klan during Reconstruction and ending with the 1944 Internal Revenue Service actions that led to the dissolution of the Klan as a corporate entity. The last fifty pages of the book consist of supplemental material such as biographical sketches of Klan leader, a glossary of Klan-related terms, and chapter notes.</p><p>Rawlings trained and worked for many years as a physician, and it was later in life that he developed interests in writing history. He is the author of a number of novels in addition to his work in history. As a developing historian, Rawlings understands methodology well enough, though at times his overall grasp of history can leave something to be desired.</p> <p>The author's brief three-page chapter on the rise of fraternal organizations would benefit from additional discussion of the importance of fraternal organizations in an era before the emergence of social safety nets: fraternal organizations typically offered members death and/or disability benefits, allowing them the ability to provide for their families in case of misfortune. In his chapter notes, though, Rawlings sums up the decline of fraternal organizations that began to appear by the 1930s somewhat flippantly: ""folks simply got tired of them"" (p.293). This statement discounts the connection between the decline of fraternal groups and the emergence of government programs such as workers' compensation, unemployment benefits, and Social Security, formal structures that replaced these private benefits.</p><p>The coverage Rawlings devoted to the 1925 kidnapping/rape/ murder trial of D.C. Stephenson is puzzling.  Rawlings argued that ""the death of Madge Oberholtzer had nothing whatsoever to do with the Ku Klux Klan"" (p.240), since Stephenson left the national Ku Klux Klan in May 1924. Rawlings seems to discount the fact that Stephenson simply created his own rival Klan organization. Rawlings acknowledged that public perception of Stephenson as a Klan leader meant that the trial reflected poorly on the Klan, but regardless of whether Stephenson was a national Klan leader or a renegade Klan rival, this event was a key factor in the declining power of the Ku Klux Klan, a trend that began to accelerate in 1925.</p><p>Rawlings unfortunately spent relatively little time discussing the 1924 national elections, which occurred at the height of Klan power and influence. The author devoted a mere paragraph to the 1924 Republican National Convention, while the highly contentious Democratic National Convention -- where the Klan figured prominently in the creation of the party's platform - received only a few pages of coverage.</p> <p>Yet Rawlings does provide significant coverage of Klan influence on Georgia politics in the decade of the 1920s. One of the strengths of the book is the detailed analysis of the role of Klan leaders in Georgia affecting state and local electoral outcomes. Rawlings uncovered fascinating information about the 1922 gubernatorial election in Georgia that sent Clifford Walker to the governor's mansion in Buckhead.</p><p>In this work Rawlings incorporates newspaper accounts from the 1920s that have not been used in existing historical literature related to the second phase of the Klan, and specialists in the field should find some of this material valuable. The book contains a wealth of contemporary images -- including photographs and scanned copies of Klan documents -- that may be of interest to historians, as some of the images came from private collections.</p><p>Rawlings views the Klan from a top-down, almost Great Man perspective. The author argued that the ""avowed tenets of Christianity, patriotism, white supremacy, the rule of law, and the rejection of things foreign were fundamentally secondary to the accumulation of wealth and power by its leaders"" (p.4). This is likely true for the small circle of leaders, and it is certainly true for the sales-oriented Kleagles who traveled the country to enroll new members and to help create new Klaverns, but for the millions of Americans who joined the Klan in the 1920s, ideology and issues mattered. People joined the Klan because they believed the group would address the problems they believed that existing government structures could not (or would not) fix, and they joined the Klan because its nativist and racist ideologies appealed to them.</p><p>This reader left with the impression that the book views the national Klan of the 1920s from a Georgian perspective. In his research Rawlings draws heavily from newspapers and documents created in Georgia and nearby states, and much of the book is well grounded in primary source research from archives in Georgie and Tennessee. Yet at times Rawlings attempts to generalize about the Klan as a national phenomenon while relying on regional source material. The challenge with this approach is that the Ku Klux Klan often modified its approach to adapt to local conditions, and the issues that were important to Klan members in Georgia at times diverged from the issues embraced in other regions of the country.</p> <p>For general readers, this book provides a solid overview of the rise and fall of the second phase of the Klan. The background information -- while brief -- nonetheless brings readers unfamiliar with the topic up to speed in a concise fashion. The book is highly readable, and Rawlings footnotes both source information as well as helpful discursive dialogue that will aid non-specialists.</p> <p><i>Michael E.

6618	9780823276608	$39.93	Shades of Green: Irish Regiments, American Soldiers, and Local Communities in the Civil War Era		Keating, Ryan W.			"Irish Unionism<p>Author Ryan Keating, Assistant Professor of History at California State University, San Bernardino has made a significant contribution to the study of Irish soldiers in the Civil War. <i>Shades of Green</i> does not look at units like the 69th New York or the Irish Brigades of Boston or Philadelphia. Instead it focuses on one unit from Connecticut--the Ninth Connecticut, and two from America's Midwest--the 23rd Illinois and the 17th Wisconsin. These units were not made up of newly immigrated Irish people, but of families that had been in America long enough to consider themselves ""assimilated. "" Although these three units were self-proclaimed Irish units and were primarily made up of immigrants, they were not totally Irish. Keating stresses that, ""it is vital to understand the ethnic composition of these regiments in order to see the similarities and differences among the soldiers' experiences. ""</p>	<p>Mainly Democrats, Irish soldiers were motivated to join the Union cause for many reasons including patriotism, and their strong commitment to inclusion while helping subvert the disturbing nativist trend endemic in America. The local communities of Irish in the Midwest had much in common with those on the East Coast. However, these units were not members of the often-studied New York Irish Brigade or members of the Army of the Potomac. Again and again Keating stresses the diversity of the Irish/American experience as he examines the soldiers, their families, and the places from which they came, especially the smaller cities throughout Illinois and Wisconsin. The liberty denied these Irish men and women in their native land showed signs of becoming a reality in their adopted country, America.  Fighting for the continuation of this momentum was a powerful incentive for Union support, and volunteers to these units saw the commitment of the Irish worth emulating. The efforts of James Mulligan in Chicago, Thomas Cahill of New Haven, and a variety of working-class, property-owning Irish Unionists in Wisconsin created units with a primarily Irish identity, and they were eager to prove that they would fight as bravely and with as much vigor as any Eastern unit such as the 69th New York.</p>	<p>By 1863, the war had gone on for two years with no predetermined end in sight. The New York Draft Riots, in July 1863, have been seen by many as the turning point in Irish support of the war, claiming that interest waned after such a violent disturbance. Author Keating examines this issue specifically, explaining and showing with personal and numerical information that, publically at least, the men from Illinois, Connecticut, and Wisconsin did not support a violent response to federal policy. The people on the home front of these units wrote to their soldiers again and again, stressing their support of the Union effort. Collectively the Draft Riots were seen as more of a knee-jerk reaction of ""a certain class"" of New York City Irish to what might be perceived as an infringements of ""rights"" that were new to them in the first place. ""As New York burned, the men of the Ninth Connecticut, 23rd Illinois, and 17th Wisconsin continued to bleed . . .. "" The Emancipation Proclamation and the insidious taint of Copperheadism were debated within the ranks, but again, it was the support of the home front that helped the Irish Democrat soldiers stay focused on winning the war. Workplace competition was a real concern, but one that would have to wait until the problem at hand had been dealt with. And, when the war finally ended, the soldiers from these units came home again, took care of those who needed help, and forged ahead in pursuit of the economic opportunities and social advancement for which they had fought.</p>	<p>The Irish are one of the most written-about ethnic groups in the Civil War. The myths and memories of those who marched under a banner of green as well as the stars and stripes are endlessly interesting. As I read this excellent book, I thought about the time in our history when Ireland was considered to be a ""s___hole, "" and her men and women were not welcomed to American shores. Ryan Keating's rich contribution to this genre is valuable because of its focus on Irish units in the western theater of the war, and his examination of the home front solidarity of a more established working class culture than that of new immigrant. He has given us another valuable piece of the American puzzle.</p><p><i>Meg Groeling received her MA in Military History, with a Civil War emphasis, in 2016, from American Public University.

6576	817319409	$39.91	A War of Words: The Rhetorical Leadership of Jefferson Davis		Atchison, R. Jarrod			"Jefferson Davis: Winning Speeches while Losing a War<p>In <i>A War of Words</i>, R. Jarrod Atchison, an associate professor in the Communications Department at Wake Forest University, examines the rhetorical leadership of Jefferson Davis.  Specifically, he analyzes how Davis's rhetoric evolved over the course of five speeches: his January 1861 resignation from the senate, his February 1861 inauguration as Confederate president, his speech before the Mississippi legislature in December 1862, his January 1863 address to Congress in reaction to the Emancipation Proclamation, and his November 1864 call for slaves to serve in the Confederate army.  According to Atchison, Davis successfully used these speeches to achieve short-term political goals, but in the long run his words failed to define the ideology of the Confederacy.  He succinctly concludes that Davis ""struggled in his role as rhetorical leader for the Confederacy."" (92)</p>    <p>The speeches serve as an excellent example of how Davis's political view changed over time.  When he left the senate, Davis used rhetoric to frame secession as an accomplished fact.  Atchison explains how, unlike his southern colleagues who used their bombastic resignation speeches to attack the United States, the Mississippi senator skillfully employed both decorum and timing (in the jargon of rhetorical analysis this included both to <i>prepon</i> -- appropriateness -- and <i>kairos</i> -- an opportune moment) to explain why secession should reduce tensions between the North and the South.  At his inauguration a month later, Davis would articulate a Confederate ideology based on civic republicanism and a commitment to states' rights.</p>    <p>The war forced Davis to change the meaning of the Confederacy.  Simply put, a nation of republican farmers committed to states' rights could not wage a successful war against a superior power.  By the end of 1862, Davis would employ amplification to portray the Union as barbarians trying to subjugate the South.  Thus, to defeat these invaders, the Confederacy had to convert itself into a nation of virtuous warriors willing to sacrifice ideals including states' rights for nationalistic measures such as conscription.  The 1863 Emancipation Proclamation only solidified this stance as it demonstrated that Lincoln's previous denials of abolitionism were lies, thereby proving the Republican abolitionist conspiracy that Fire Eaters had long alleged.  Ironically, given this commitment to the defense of slavery, Davis would, at the end of the following year, call for the arming of slaves, urging Confederates to sacrifice slavery for their independence.</p>      <p>Davis's themes changed dramatically over the four years of the war, and Atchison contends that the president did not do enough to prepare southerners for these transformations.  Atchison charges the president with ""overlooking the long-term rhetorical work necessary to sustain a sense of Confederate nationalism in favor of short-term political gains."" (2)  A gifted orator, Davis rallied southerners behind his particular plans, but he did not create a long-term loyalty to the Confederacy.</p>      <p>Atchison credits his interest in the Civil War history to his days as an undergraduate student in Paul Escott's class.  Apparently, Atchison took notes very well.  His analysis of Davis's failure to create a Confederate nationalism dovetails with his mentor's conclusions in <i>After Secession: Jefferson Davis and the Failure of Confederate Nationalism</i>.   In doing so, however, Atchison never acknowledges the opposing side of this historiographic debate, which would contend that Davis did an impressive job in keeping the Confederacy afloat for four years and in transforming states'rights imbued southerners into Confederates willing to sacrifice over 260,000 lives in a failed bid for their independence.</p>    <p>To put it another way, Atchison does not always carefully separate cause and effect.  Did Davis's speeches fail to create Confederate nationalism and contribute to its defeat?  Or, instead of lacking will, did the Confederacy lose will in the wake of military reverses?  And if the answer is to this latter question is ""yes,"" then is it possible that Davis's stirring speeches lengthened rather than shortened the Confederacy's life?  While historians will never achieve consensus on these answers, Atchison could have done more to buttress his side of the argument.  First, he could have offered some thoughts as to what Davis should have done in these speeches to create a viable Confederate nationalism.  Second, he could have analyzed more speeches or writings.  <i>A War of Words</i> looks at two speeches within a month in 1861, another two within a month in 1862-3, and a final one in November of 1864.  This arrangement leaves two separate 22-month gaps: February 1861 to December 1862 and January 1863 to November 1864.  During these periods, Davis delivered other speeches and messages to Congress that would help demonstrate the evolution of his rhetoric.  Third, to help prove his case, the book would have benefitted from a greater discussion of the reactions to Davis's speeches.  At times, there is a brief discussion of newspaper coverage, but not enough to provide the reader with a sense of the speeches' impact on popular opinion (recognizing that popular opinion is impossible to gauge in the nineteenth century).</p>    <p>Despite these misgivings, <i>A War of Words</i> is to be commended on several fronts.  First, it takes the language of political speeches seriously.  Too often, this rhetoric is ignored in studies of the Civil War.  The words of political leaders mattered, and Atchison's work reminds us to give them the consideration they deserve.  Second, he stresses the evolution of rhetoric over time.  Often scholars posit nationalism as static entity -- either it existed or it did not.  In contrast, Atchison uses Davis's speeches to show that Confederate nationalism of 1861 did not equate to Confederate nationalism of 1865.  Third, the author manages to accomplish these goals in a very brief and readable book (fewer than 100 pages of text).  The fact that the reader will wish for additional pages is more of a positive than a negative.  Overall, if you study Civil War Era politics, A War of Words deserves a place on your bookshelf.</p>    <p><i>John M. Sacher is an Associate Professor of History at the University of Central Florida.

6571	9780813939278	$39.50	The First Republican Army: The Army of Virginia and the Radicalization of the Civil War		Matsui, John H.			"John Pope, the Army of Virginia, and the Road to Hard War	<p>Civil War historians find the political motives behind Union squabbles in the Eastern Theater fascinating. Scholars and lay readers alike can count on a constant barrage of books on the high command of the Army of the Potomac, for instance, replete with well-worn accounts of backstabbing by George McClellan, Fitz John Porter, and Joseph Hooker. Over the past several years, however, a critical mass of innovative literature by young scholars such as Timothy Orr and Jonathan White has emerged to investigate the rich intersections of soldier ideology and command politics, adding to earlier pioneering work by historians such as John Hennessy. Instead of debating how many Union soldiers embraced emancipation, as scholars of the 1990s and early 2000s did, historians now want to know what that undeniable ideological divide meant for command and control.</p><p>Into this fray marches John H. Matsui with <i>The First Republican Army</i>, an investigation of the Army of Virginia and its political culture under Maj. Gen. John Pope in the summer of 1862. Matsui argues that Pope's short-lived army, later absorbed into the larger Army of the Potomac, pierced the heartland of northern Virginia as a vanguard for hard war against slavery and southern society. He attributes this phenomenon to two principal facts: first, that the Army of Virginia, more than its counterpart under George McClellan, represented a true cross-section of the Republican-voting north, and second, that the experience of occupying and plundering Virginia towns and farmland gave Pope's men more direct, radicalizing contact with slavery. In Pope the Army of Virginia found a leader who turned a blind eye to raiding, belittled conservative West Point dogma, and applauded the harsh punishment of disloyalty wherever it could be uprooted.</p><p>The Army of Virginia stands in stark ideological contrast to the Army of the Potomac, Matsui argues. Whereas Pope encouraged plunder and emancipation, loyalty to the Democratic Party ""extended from the top down in McClellan's army, from generals to regimental and company officers to the common soldier"" (6). The Army of the Potomac, Matsui declares, had experienced nothing like the Army of Virginia's ""double disadvantages"" of an aggressive enemy and hostile population (48). Indeed, the author states, the radicalism pervading Pope's subordinates and staff officers made them far likelier than counterparts in Little Mac's army to trust escaped slaves as intelligence sources. In making this larger argument about the institutional and political divide, Matsui adds a fresh dimension to the debate over political dysfunction in the Army of the Potomac, highlighting that the eventual transfer of Army of Virginia forces into McClellan's ranks injected radicalism into an otherwise conservative organization. But his emphasis on Democratic allegiance in the Army of the Potomac may be overstated. In mid-1862, it could well be argued, the vast majority of Army of the Potomac enlisted men were still political neophytes with little of the partisan maturity gained through the tribulations of 1863 and 1864. He asserts that Pope's army was the ""harbinger"" of hard war and, after their transfer to McClellan's ranks, ""the vanguard of the pro-emancipation and punitive turn of the overall Union war effort"" (3). This last statement is perhaps more asserted than proven. Additional work remains to be done on the relationship between Army of Virginia veterans and Army of the Potomac rank and file as the war progressed and the battle with Copperheads at home reached a crescendo.</p><p>Perhaps the most innovative aspect of Matsui's book is his emphasis on the brigade as the ""fundamental political unit"" of the Army of Virginia. His work dovetails with Gerald Prokopowicz's <i>All for the Regiment</i> in highlighting the importance of lower-level unit cohesion to organizational and political culture. Matsui offers a brilliant metaphor for describing the political debate within specific regiments, identifying the field officers as a veritable Senate, the company-grade officers as the House of Representatives, and the enlisted men as the vast constituency. Historians would do well to utilize this model in analyzing the Civil War volunteer army as a hybrid of military and social hierarchy.</p> <p>Matsui's source base is a commendable blend of diaries and letters from across the north, collections representing each significant demographic subset within the Army of Virginia. He does rely heavily on accounts from men in shoulder straps (a common flaw, to be fair), which leads him to the questionable assertion that Louis Blenker's German-American division stood firm in its belief that ""slavery must be destroyed to preserve the Union, thus enabling Confederates to combine nativism with racism"" (12).

6332	9780674495166	$26.95	Africans in the Old South: Mapping Exceptional Lives across the Atlantic World		Sparks, Randy J.			"Lives of Distance: African Journeys in the Atlantic World<p>This highly readable work explores the peregrinations of several people of African descent around the Atlantic world during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.  The author argues that such biographical microhistories, while often difficult to construct from available sources, give a more granular texture to historical knowledge and the lessons of history than can generally be derived from macro-oriented reconstructions of the past.   In six chapters of varying length and detail, the book conveys fascinating glimpses of Africans navigating the perils of their ""life geographies,"" penetrating porous boundaries between slavery and freedom while careening against (and sometimes through) hardening categories of racial identity and lineage. </p> <p>Sparks positions his book as part of the ""biographical turn"" that has become naturalized within the study of African experiences in the transatlantic frame.  In some instances, he is able to offer rich renderings of individual lives and family networks, such as in the case of the Clevelands and the Holmans, mixed-race families in South Carolina who -- especially the Clevelands -- experienced an approximate equality with whites.  In other instances, the evidentiary trail is more vague and limited, compelling the author to build more ethereal biographies upon contextual clues and circumstantial linkages to known facts.  In general, this approach works well, giving the reader access to the lives of individuals such as Robert Johnson, a man of Kissi origin kidnapped from Africa as a boy and enslaved in Georgia, but later able to gain his freedom and become a voice in the Boston free-black and abolitionist communities.  This observation is also true of Dimmock Charlton, another man of Kissi origin reduced to slavery in Georgia, but who was ultimately able to acquire freedom in the northeastern United States and procure the liberty of a granddaughter through dogged legal efforts and communal mobilization. </p>  <p>There are several themes that flow through the book that are worth mention. Geography and mobility are not only part of the backdrop of each story, but crucial mediums that give shape and form to identities and possibilities.  The author helpfully includes a number of maps for charting the movement of his subjects, which further underscore how context and environment mattered to their experiences.  Some lives were lived out on a number of continents and waterways, connecting places like inland Sierra Leone and the Gambia River to locations such as Charleston (SC), Mobile (AL), Providence (RI), Jamaica, and London.  Examining other lives illuminates the ruptures between urban and rural settings, with the former sometimes offering economic opportunities for the hiring out of slaves (who might one day save enough money for self-purchase) and the latter consigning an individual to obscure, lifelong bondage in the Carolina Lowcountry or Mississippi Delta.  Another prominent motif of the book is the elasticity of slavery and the precariousness of freedom for blacks throughout the Atlantic world, with the ever-present danger of (re)enslavement weighing on many, regardless of locale.  All of these concerns contributed to a certain malleability of life chances and identity options for African peoples and their progeny of various ranks, often accompanied by a vibrant worldliness that was a necessity for taking advantage of whatever fleeting opportunities that existed for improving one's lot. The author's caveats concerning the often silencing effect that the fetishization of archives can have when it comes to the stories of oppressed people are especially well taken. </p>  <p>The book does have a few quirks. The author makes the concluding statement that ""Historians of slavery in the antebellum South have shown little interest in the African presence,"" an assertion that would likely surprise scholars in the field such as Michael Gomez and Ira Berlin, and a claim made even the more baffling by the author's citation of the work of both authors in the book's notes (160, 168n6, 168n7).  A more troubling reference is made in regard to a slaveholder whom Sparks characterizes, quite problematically, as ""a good master,"" even though a paragraph earlier this same individual was described as having illegally enslaved blacks from the Bahamas (117). Aside from these stumbles, <i>Africans in the Old South</i> is, overall, a solid addition to the literature on African life in the Atlantic region. </p>  <p><i>Claude Clegg teaches history at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

6515	9781469631271	$29.93	Sex and the Civil War: Soldiers, Pornography, and the Making of American Morality		Giesberg, Judith			"Masculinity and Morality<p>Originally written for the Steven and Janice Brose Lectures in the Civil War Era at Pennsylvania State University, <i>Sex and the Civil War</i> explores ""the Civil War origins of a federal conversation about sex and sexual regulation"" (5). In four brief chapters, Judith Giesberg traces the increased production and distribution of erotica in mid-century America; ""the triumph of pornography"" in the Civil War era (3); the wartime misadventures of Anthony Comstock, who was the butt of practical jokes and ""unpleasant words"" during his brief stint in the U.S. Army (67-68); and the post-war anti-pornography campaign that culminated in the Comstock Law of 1873 (named for its most vigorous enforcer), which prohibited not only the circulation of salacious novels and cartes de visite but also the dissemination of information about birth control and abortion. The campaign to control ""obscene"" materials may have begun with a desire to protect the minds and morals of male ""youth,"" Giesberg points out, but it ultimately created an ""enduring legal legacy"" of restrictions on women's sexuality and reproduction (98).</p><p>Giesberg set out to explore the lived experiences of a generation of men -- those who came of age during the Civil War -- and to support her contention that ""war does more to sustain gender hierarchy than to upset it."" (7) She succeeds on both of these counts. But <i>Sex and the Civil War</i> does more than this.  It also provides fresh insights into contested -- but crystallizing -- definitions of masculinity in Victorian America. By tracing the spread of sexually charged materials into the camps of northern soldiers -- a development facilitated by special postal rates and routes for the U.S. Army -- Giesberg is able to document the rise of a shared ""sexual culture"" (36) that both fostered an esprit de corps among enlisted men and officers and sanctioned the commodification and consumption of female bodies.  Both official records -- such as the court martial of Colonel Ebenezer Peirce of the 29th Regiment of Massachusetts Volunteers for sharing <i>Fanny Hill</i> with the men in his command -- and private accounts -- such as the wartime diary of future anti-pornography crusader Anthony Comstock -- demonstrate that conventional definitions of manliness revolving around self-control retained some currency in Civil War America.  Nonetheless, the war marked a significant turning point in the rise of a male culture of sexual conquest -- a cultural norm that is once again both on display and under scrutiny in the aftermath of a national election in which a presidential candidate boasted openly about sexual assault.  The male sexual culture that emerged from the crucible of the Civil War has proven to be just as enduring -- and as damaging -- as the legal restrictions on women's reproduction that were written into post-war anti-pornography legislation.</p>  <p><i>Sex and the Civil War</i> is a slender but wide-ranging volume that offers intriguing glimpses not only into the much-maligned ""yellow-backed"" novels that were cataloged in anti-obscenity prosecutions (the illustrations are not typical fare for academic monographs) but also into attitudes about youth, concerns about a ""marital crisis"" (91), the role of the state in regulating morality, the pornographic tendencies of abolitionist literature, and much more.</p>  <p>A perhaps inescapable result of this broad remit is that some questions remain unanswered. While Giesberg calls attention to the irony that the Young Men's Christian Association, once at the forefront of the anti-obscenity movement, also established social centers destined to become a mecca for men in search of homosexual encounters, she does not devote as much attention to the homosexual overtones of army men's shared sexual culture as some readers might wish. What do we make of men reading erotic literature aloud to one another, taking turns to peer through a stereoscope at revealing photos, or gathering in groups to witness real-life (hetero)sexual encounters? By framing camp culture as a rejection of the culture of domesticity, Giesberg sidesteps such questions. Perhaps more importantly for the central concerns of this volume, the reasons for the linkages between the post-war campaigns against pornography and abortion remain unclear. The Young Men's Christian Association -- which advocated legal restrictions on obscene materials -- and the American Medical Association -- which added riders defining information about contraception and abortion as obscene -- may have regarded their alliance as a holy one, but surely there is more to the story than ""popular opinion sanctioning the moral authority of the state."" (95)</p><p>These criticisms should not be taken as condemnation. Rather, the unanswered questions raised by <i>Sex and the Civil War</i> suggest that Giesberg has produced a genuinely provocative work, one that should establish new lines of inquiry for scholars of gender, sexuality, and the state -- as well as the Civil War -- for years to come.</p><p><i>Anya Jabour is Regents Professor of History and a past Co-Director of Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies at the University of Montana, Missoula.

6408	9780674048935	$45.00	Law and the Modern Mind: Consciousness and Responsibility in American Legal Culture		Blumenthal, Susanna L.			"Mental Capacity and Legal Responsibility in American History<p>Early U.S. jurisprudence with respect to consciousness and responsibility was marked by fundamental contradictions. Both the Revolution and the founding of the Republic were premised on a belief that the people were capable of self-government. On the other hand, this assumption did not extend to slaves, who were under the control of their masters; or to women, who were under the power of their husbands while married and were denied the franchise in any event. The Union victory in the Civil War and the ensuing Reconstruction Amendments to the Constitution brought African-Americans within the class of persons who were, at least formally, granted a seat at the table of self-government, although that seat was often little more than a legal fiction. Women continued to be denied a seat at the table until the twentieth century.</p><p>In her new book, legal historian Susanna Blumenthal explores another locus of contradiction in early American law: courtroom disputes and jurisprudence relating to mental capacity. Blumenthal's book builds on the earlier work of Milton Green, a legal realist writing in the 1940s. In a series of law review articles, Green had called attention to a seeming disconnect in American jurisprudence between a stated preference for objective standards and the actual application of subjective tests that asked questions about state of mind that were impossible for judges to answer. Blumenthal takes this analysis to a deeper level by situating the evidence within a historical framework and connecting developments in jurisprudence to broader trends in the development of political and intellectual thought and the evolution of American society. Her study shows how nineteenth-century American jurists ""wrestled mightily with what were truly existential dilemmas, even as they insisted law was a 'practical' science."" (289)</p><p>Among her many insights, Blumenthal identifies ways in which the Civil War marked a turning point in the evolution of capacity litigation and jurisprudence. According to Blumenthal, the traumatic experience of the Civil War undermined the faith of Gilded Age judges in their ability to make sense of the functioning of the human mind. In Blumenthal's words, these judges ""expected that medical experts and laymen would disagree about where to draw the line between sanity and insanity,"" and ""displayed a marked solicitude for the eccentric will, some even positively associating it with human autonomy."" (162) The Civil War also produced a new category of capacity litigation, as a generation of grieving war widows ""seeking to communicate with the dead contributed to the increasing popularity of Spiritualism,"" which in turn produced difficult legal questions about the line between eccentric religious beliefs and insane delusions. (197-198)</p><p>Blumenthal concludes her book by suggesting that historians should take legal records more seriously as a source of insight into the American intellectual tradition. As an example what such records might be able to reveal, Blumenthal's excellent book is a great place to start.</p><p><i>Joshua C.

6619	9780807165720	$29.95	The Confederate Homefront: A History in Documents		Hettle, Wallace			"Merging Home Front and Battle Front<p>Wallace Hettle, Professor of History at the University of Northern Iowa is the author of <i>Inventing Stonewall Jackson: A Civil War Hero in History and Memory</i> an exploration of the authors who shaped our understanding of a civil war legend.  Professor Hettle now offers us a collection of primary sources that present the story of the Confederate Home Front through the eyes of those who experienced the conflagration first hand.  Hettle's goal is to demonstrate that the line between battlefront and home front is far from rigid and, as the Civil War was fought predominantly in the South, this collection of documents clearly illustrate his point.  Moreover the array of sources the author uses unmistakably reveals the complexity of the war years.  Here we have myriad voices from women, slaves, soldiers, politicians, ministers, journalists as well as more traditional military orders.  The book, arranged chronologically, contains one chapter for each of the war years and a preface for each document presented.</p><p>For 1861 Hettle begins with rationales for secession, and goes on to include views of slaves, slave owners, and white women, as well as journalists and even the clergy.  He also uses commentary on the first shots of the war and suggests that as fighting began in a city -- namely Charleston, South Carolina - this underscores that home front and battlefield would never be distinctly demarcated.  Also included is the Union struggle to determine a policy for the treatment of runaway slaves.  A nice inclusion is a short account by Mark Twain whose irony highlights how quickly disillusionment might set in.  This year marked much uncertainty but the centrality of slavery is plainly established.</p><p>1862 includes some unexpected perspectives.  For example that of a female black abolitionist who had travelled south to the Sea Islands to educate former slaves.  The two petitions from political prisoner to Tennessee Governor Andrew Johnson give us a compelling view into inner dissent as does the prison diary of a Unionist.  Early dissent is a focal point of this section as we read commentaries on the military draft, the human cost of battle, and the early use of black labor in Union occupied Mississippi.</p><p>Dissent and growing despair continue in 1863 as we read a grief stricken mother's letter describing her concerns about anti-Semitism, and bread riots.  The inclusion of advertisements for runaway slaves highlights the difficulties of keeping the home front functioning smoothly. We also learn of the plight of refugees, the death of Jackson, and the evolution of Union policy to hard war.  Moreover, even as guerilla warfare tore up the local countryside, planters were objecting to the impressment of their slaves on the grounds that it was an unfair tax.</p><p>In 1864, Jefferson Davis focused on raising morale in an address to South Carolina women encouraging them to marry a maimed soldier.  The focus on slavery continues as we read Patrick Cleburne's proposal.  The New Orleans <i>Tribune</i> (the only black owned newspaper in the Confederacy) celebrated the performance of black union soldiers at Fort Pillow and accused Confederate soldiers of barbarous behavior.  By 1864 the end was in sight and the white run New Orleans newspaper, <i>De Bows</i>, warns that surrender would surely result in the subjugation of the South.  The most moving document in this section is the despair expressed by a Confederate woman over the death and destruction to which she has been witness over the past three years.</p><p>Unsurprisingly 1865 is the shortest section and perhaps the least powerful.  The selections here are somewhat confusing and depend heavily on post war memoirs.  The inclusion of Edmund Ruffin's suicide note is the most powerful and a nice touch given that Ruffin also appeared in the first section when he claimed the ""honor"" of firing the first shot of the war.</p><p>Each section is concise and the excerpts themselves are brief which students often prefer. Perhaps a general audience would also like the brevity although I do not see the book's broader appeal. However, the presentation of multiple perspectives lends itself well to teaching the complexities of the war.  What is especially valuable is that, while the author never tackles the question of whether slavery was the cause of the war, his selection of documents makes it crystal clear that the slavery question remained central from secession to the end of the war and beyond.</p>  <p>The main weakness of this book is the lack of contextualization before each document.  In many cases the editor does not provide enough information and his comments sometimes lack accuracy.  For example, Hettle does advise caution when using the WPA Narratives collected in the 1920s and 1930s, but he does not provide enough information on the vagaries of memory.  Surely there should be a similar warning about the multiple memoirs that are used without differentiating them from contemporary letters and diaries.  In fact the collection depends too heavily on post war memories. The volume would also benefit from a short introduction to each year setting out the major events of the war.  Furthermore, a bibliography would be very helpful.  These minor flaws do not however take from this very valuable resource especially in a classroom setting.</p><p><i>Jacqueline Glass Campbell, Associate Professor of History, Francis Marion University, Florence, SC.

6561	146962933X	$49.95	Gathering to Save a Nation: Lincoln and the Union's War Governors		Engle, Stephen D.			"Mobilizing a Country, Saving a Nation: Lincoln and the War Governors<p>In his manuscript <i>Lincoln and the Union Governors</i> (2013), part of the Concise Lincoln Library with SIU Press, William C. Harris observed that little has been written about President Abraham Lincoln's working relationship with the Union Governors. Indeed, aside from Harris's short book, William Hesseltine's <i>Lincoln and the War Governors</i> (1948) has been the standard narrative for nearly seventy years. However, Stephen Engle's recent book <i>Gathering to Save a Nation: Lincoln & the Union's War Governors</i> changes that.</p><p>Dr. Engle is well suited to write this story. Besides teaching undergraduate and graduate courses in the nineteenth century at Florida Atlantic University, he is an accomplished author of the Civil War Era. His previous works include <i>Yankee Dutchman: The Life of Franz Sigel</i> (1993) and <i>Don Carlos Buell: Most Promising of All</i> (1999), as well as general histories of the war in the west and Lincoln's wartime presidency. In this, his most recent book, Engle argues against the theory put forward by Hasseltine that, in mobilizing the nation for war, Union governors followed while Lincoln led. Instead, Engle states that the relationship between the governors and the president was truly collaborative. Union governors such as Republicans Richard Yates of Illinois, Andrew Curtin of Pennsylvania, and John Andrew of Massachusetts partnered with Lincoln to, as Engle states on page 2, ""mobilize for war, and, at times, push him toward greater national efforts."" Even Democratic governors such as John Downey of California and Beriah Magoffin of Kentucky, while critical of Lincoln's policies and--in Magoffin's case--reticent to support either side of the war, ultimately stifled attempts at disunion in their states. In arguing against Hesseltine's top-down theory of executive leadership, Engle also reinforces the theory that Lincoln sought to preserve constitutional federalism within a new national framework. ""The net result,"" Engle writes on page 7, ""is a book that focuses on a collection of leaders who helped Lincoln gather the resources to save a nation."" </p><p>Besides providing a new interpretation of the role of executive leadership--both national and statewide--during the Civil War, Engle's book reinforces the prevailing image of Lincoln as ""conciliator-in-chief"", putting out fires started by strong-willed subordinates. This trend over the last decade--since the publication of Doris Kearns Goodwin's <i>Team of Rivals</i> (2005)--seeks to better understand how Lincoln became an expert politician, fostering partnerships with political rivals, and effectively managing relationships between civilian and military leaders in order to successfully carry out his public policy goals. In recent years, thanks especially to the national interest in the sixteenth president spawned by the bicentennial of his birth as well as the sesquicentennial of the Civil War, Lincoln admirers and scholars have been blessed with new biographies of subordinate officers such as Elizabeth Leonard's <i>Lincoln's Forgotten Ally: Judge Advocate General Joseph Holt of Kentucky</i>  (2011), Walter Star's <i>Seward: Lincoln's Indispensable Man</i> (2012), William Marvel's <i>Lincoln's Autocrat: The Life of Edwin Stanton</i> (2015), and Joshua Zeitz's <i>Lincoln's Boys: John Hay, John Nicolay, and the War for Lincoln's Image</i> (2014) to name only a select few. We have also seen new works discussing Lincoln's relationship with, and management of military officers such as David Work's <i>Lincoln's Political Generals</i> (2009), and Stephen Sears's <i>Lincoln's Lieutenants: The High Command of the Army of the Potomac</i>(2017)--both of which, like Engle, argue against the older theory of Lincoln as facilitating a top-down approach to military affairs. It is a safe assumption that more works like these will follow in the years to come. Whether they be cabinet officials, military commanders, or state governors, Lincoln carefully established channels of communication and partnerships at every level of the federal system, keeping all interested parties focused on the same universal goal of winning the war. ""Governors,"" Engle writes on page 477, ""had established a partnership with Lincoln that demonstrated the powerful bond between the nation and the states. The war had proven that the republic the Founding Fathers engineered decades before had matured into a more perfect Union of states."" </p><p>Aside from its contribution to the field of Civil War studies, it might also be worthwhile to note a few general strengths of Engle's book as a scholarly work.  If good histories inspires others to continue down the path they have tread, then historians and students alike will be pleased with Engle's work. Not only does he provide a helpful appendix of names of Union war governors, classified by state and time in office, but he has also consulted a vast array of primary and secondary sources that are exhaustively chronicled in the endnotes, which alone cover 127 pages of text!  The bibliography is another impressive sixty-nine pages of text, which will no doubt prove a rich resource to scholars wishing to delve further into the lives and political careers of the persons touched upon in this work.</p><p>Dr. Engle's <i>Gathering to Save a Nation</i> is the kind of superior scholarly work one comes to expect from the University of North Carolina Press. Over time, the press has become the national leader on Civil War studies. Indeed, several of the above-mentioned works by other authors were also published by the press. Dr. Engle's new book, then, is in good company. An important contribution to the field, <i>Gathering to Save a Nation</i> will assuredly become the standard work on the subject of Lincoln and the Union war governors for generations to come.</p><p><i>Dr. Mark A. Neels is Visiting Assistant Professor of History at Western Wyoming Community College in Rock Springs, Wyoming.

Cutrer defines the Trans-Mississippi as exactly that, the entire area west of the Mississippi. The book is the latest addition to the Littlefield History of the Civil War Era Series.  His purpose in writing <i>Theater of a Separate War</i> was to write an ""analytical military narrative"" that will establish a foundation and framework for future scholars"" who write on Civil War in the Trans-Mississippi West. (p. xii) Time will tell if he succeeds in reaching this lofty goal.</p> <p>The work's thoroughness and length are both its strength and greatest weakness.  <i>Theater of a Separate War</i> seemingly details every military engagement that took place west of the Mississippi, but Cutrer does not separate battles with little or no significance to those that impacted the outcome of the war.  He gives all a full going over.  Why he gave so much attention to Indian Warfare in the Far West is puzzling, while others, such as the New Mexico Campaign, he gave only one chapter.  One gets the impression, from reading the book that no area, no matter its location, was spared the ravages of the war.  This is remarkable given the size of the area involved.</p> 	<p>Cutrer describes battles in areas as far removed as Arizona, Indian Territory, and Louisiana, although he mainly focuses on Missouri, Arkansas and western Louisiana. In a nod to the current Civil War scholarship on small unit actions and guerilla warfare, Cutrer devotes a chapter to the guerilla war in Missouri and portions of others to guerilla warfare in other states. The book includes chapters on battles along the Texas coast and Milligan's Bend, part of the campaign for Vicksburg, which took place in Louisiana, west of the Mississippi River.  Campaigns often neglected in histories of the Trans-Mississippi Civil War.</p>  	<p>Although lengthy and thorough, problems occur that keep the book from achieving the goal Cutrer set forth for it in the Preface, (p. xii) chief among them the sloppy editing, throughout.  One example stands out; Cutrer seems to imply Tucson, Arizona is a short distance from the Rio Grande Valley, (p. 113-114) when in fact almost 300 miles separate the two.  In a book reported to be a ""analytical military narrative"" (p. xii) and so through in nature, the lack of maps is very puzzling.  There is only one rudimentary map at the front of the book, which is of little help.  With the profusion of names, dates, the vast distances involved, and profusion of small-scale battles, a series of maps are obviously called for.  More than a few typos, awkward transitions, and other mistakes crop up in the manuscript as well.</p>	<p>It is unfortunate that this thoroughly researched and important work is plagued by the problems outlined above.  The book would have been greatly enhanced with the addition of more maps, stronger editing, and a conscious effort to prioritize the book's subject matter.</p><p>John T.

6614	9781563686801	$39.95	Fighting in the Shadows: Untold Stories of Deaf People in the Civil War		Lang, Harry G.			"Out of the Shadows: Deaf People and the Civil War<p>Harry G. Lang's <i>Fighting in the Shadows: Untold Stories of Deaf People in the Civil War</i> is an impressive text even before one lifts the cover. Large and heavy, the size of a coffee table book, a quick flip through the pages reveals beautiful formatting, with numerous photographs and images of primary source material.</p> <p>But the design isn't the only impressive thing about this book. Lang, scientist-turned-historian and Professor Emeritus at the National Technical Institute for the Deaf at the Rochester Institute of Technology, has skillfully woven together dozens of stories from and about deaf and hard of hearing Americans who lived through the Civil War. Lang is right to point out that the history of deaf people during the Civil War era is almost entirely untold, and while historians have, on occasion, acknowledged the deafness of certain individuals, no one has used deafness as the central focus of inquiry into the era. This volume is clear proof of Douglas Baynton's maxim that disability history is everywhere, if only we look for it.<sup>1</sup></p> <p>The book deftly charts the many interconnections between historical themes -- reform, education, combat, and disability, to name a few -- that are typically treated as independent. For example, the first chapter of the book explores the links between the antebellum deaf education movement and abolition. Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet, the hearing educator and early proponent of sign language, served as a kind of interpreter for the enslaved men tried for the <i>Amistad</i> uprising. Gallaudet spent days in the jail, working with the West African men to develop a sign language they could use to overcome their language barrier. Harriet Martineau, the British writer, thinker, and abolitionist, lost most of her hearing at age twelve, which William Lloyd Garrison saw as a positive, at least when it came to the criticism she received in the United States for her politics: ""Miss Martineau, by being deaf, is not troubled with the gabble of voluble tongues.""(9) Further, Lang includes the ways that deafness was used strategically, especially by escaping slaves such as William and Ellen Craft, who posed as deaf master and hearing servant to escape bondage. Such stories demonstrate just how interconnected deaf activism and abolition were in the years before the Civil War.</p> <p>The book includes some real revelations -- to me, anyway. The ""wig-wag"" system of communicating with flags used by the U. S. Signal Corps, was first developed as a communication device for the deaf by Albert James Myer, a hearing man, who later adapted the system for use by the military. Frank Beard, war-time cartoonist and illustrator, was deaf. John Wilkes Booth learned a bit of sign language to communicate with his friend Laura Redden, largely so that she could help him write love poetry for his fiancé. Confederate James Longstreet's unshakeable calm may have stemmed from superior resolve, but it could also have been because his partial deafness inured him from some of the chaos of battle. The famous (infamous?) South Carolina fire-eater Edmund Ruffin believed his intense depression after the Confederate defeat was partly the result of his deafness, writing that ""no one who is not as deaf as myself can conceive the miserable condition of isolation, & virtual exclusion from conversation & all personal social intercourse, in which I have been paced & confined by that infirmity."" (165)</p> <p>Tales like these are both the strength and weakness of <i>Fighting in the Shadows</i>. The stories demonstrate that though historians may see Civil War history and disability history as distinct fields, they overlap and interconnect in critically important ways. By exploring the experiences of average deaf people and by placing focus on the deafness of well-known figures, Lang reminds us that disabled experiences and disabled people are an integral part of the history of the Civil War era. The many stories in the volume can also be something of a weakness, however, as the book sometimes feels packed with trivia without a central organizing thesis other than the desire point out the presence and importance of these figures. But as so many of these stories have heretofore gone untold, that in itself is a worthy goal, and the resulting book is a pleasure to read and to display.</p><p><i>Sarah Handley-Cousins is a historian and writer living in Buffalo, New York.</i></p>  <p>__________</p><p><sup>1</sup> Douglas Baynton, ""Disability and the Justification of Inequality in American History,"" in <i>The New Disability History: American Perspectives</i>, eds.

"Passing the Military Test <p>Professional historians have produced a steady flow of books about United States Colored Troops (USCT) in recent years.  It is well known that African American soldiers played an unforgettable role in helping to defeat the Confederate States, thereby guaranteeing the preservation of the Union.  Doubtless, the Civil War was a transformative event in the nation's history, which ultimately brought about freedom for the slaves.  In a real sense, Douglas R. Egerton's book, <i>Thunder at the Gates</i>  is a biographical study of the three black Massachusetts regiments of the Civil War: the 54th, the 55th, and the 5th Cavalry.  By focusing on only three units, the author is able to provide the reader with a close up view of the regiments in all of their military dimensions. Egerton meticulously chronicles the recruitment, organization, and performance of these units. While the officers of the Massachusetts regiments are not ignored, this volume is foremost about the rank and file members of the units.  Although the Fifty-fourth, the most celebrated black unit of the Civil War receives the most attention in this work, the other two regiments do not suffer from a lack of analysis.  Egerton tells a compelling story of intrepidity, sacrifice, struggle, and determination in this impressively researched and superbly crafted monograph.</p>               <p>Egerton provides a nuanced discussion of northerners' opposition to the idea of black enlistment.  They offered a wide range of arguments against the creation of a black army.  White resistance to colored enrollment did not discourage Negro men from wanting to join the Union war effort.  They found support for their quest to form a ""liberating army"" from influential advocates such as Governor John A. Andrew of Massachusetts and Frederick Douglass.  The North and President Abraham Lincoln himself slowly came around to the notion that colored men were needed to help fight the war.  When the Emancipation Proclamation unlocked the door of enlistment for black men, they walked through with confidence and enthusiasm.  They would have many opportunities to prove that they were worth the federal government's investment in them as soldiers.  The men of the Massachusetts units were motivated to join the fight in order to demonstrate their patriotism, to free the slaves, to experience adventure, and to acquire money.  Egerton maintains that in 1863, ""virtually all Americans"" fully ""understood that the three black regiments were to serve as a test case"" (7).  We cannot, however, lose sight of the fact that the Massachusetts regiments were three of the 166 African American units that helped the Union army to emerge victorious.  There was as much apprehension as excitement surrounding the creation of the Fifty-fourth, the first black regiment organized in the North.   The colored soldiers were prepared to spill their blood and that of the enemy for the Union and for their race.  Egerton reveals that it did not take the troops of the Bay State long to learn that prejudicial treatment in the United States Army would be a part of their military life.  The unequal pay was a constant reminder to black volunteers that they were less valuable than their white comrades in the eyes of the Lincoln government.  The pay inequity added to the misery and deprivation of their loved ones on the home front.</p>                                           <p>This volume makes it clear that the success of the three Massachusetts regiments was inextricably tied to the leadership ability of the white officers who commanded them.  The heroic performance of the 54th at the battle of Fort Wagner on July 18, 1863, attracted national attention and earned the black warriors the admiration of a grateful nation.  On page 145, Egerton writes that ""the assault on Wagner, while a military disaster, quickly became a political victory.""  The death of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw at Wagner endeared him to black soldiers and civilians alike.  Fort Wagner was not the only place where African American troops experienced military setbacks.  The USCT including the 54th were led ""into a trap"" by General Truman Seymour at the battle of Olustee in Florida on February 20, 1864.  This was the largest battle fought in Florida during the tumultuous years of the 1860s and a defeat for the Union army.  Several thousand USCT were on duty in South Carolina during the war.  The 54th and 55th were part of General John P. Hatch's army that saw action at the battle of Honey Hill near Beaufort on November 30, 1864. Egerton argues in <i>Thunder at the Gates</i> that inadequate reconnaissance work combined with poor leadership doomed Hatch's army.  In several battles during the Civil War, the bravery of the colored soldiers could not overcome the incompetent leadership of white officers.  The author missed the opportunity to point out that the real significance of the Confederate triumph at Honey Hill was that it prevented the Union army from cutting the Charleston and Savannah Railroad.  This victory allowed General William J. Hardee to evacuate his army of 12,000 men from Savannah via the railroad as General William T. Sherman marched on the beautiful city by the sea in December 1864.  As the war came to a close, the Fifty-fourth along with several other United States colored units took an active part in General Edward A. Potter's raid in South Carolina.  The freeing of more than 6,000 slaves in the Palmetto State was especially satisfying to the men of the Massachusetts regiments.  The black men in blue were doubtless most proud of their role as liberators.</p>        <p>This richly illustrated study does an outstanding job of capturing the human quality of the soldiers of the Massachusetts regiments.  Their humor, trepidation, loneliness, disappointment, solidarity, valor, and sadness are on display in this book.  Like other Union regiments, the author points out that the men of the 54th, 55th, and 5th Cavalry had their share of cowards, deserters, and unsavory characters.  Egerton offers an insightful observation on the complexional divide within black regiments.  Officers routinely recommended light-skinned African American soldiers for advancement, thereby connecting complexion to privilege.  Although Stephen A. Swails, Peter Vogelsang, and James Monroe Trotter were exemplary soldiers, the fact that they were nearly white was a bonus.   When the 21st USCT marched into Charleston, the birthplace of the revolution on February 18, 1865, followed a few days later by the Massachusetts 55th and 54th, celebrations erupted in the city among the former slaves.  The occupation of the city by black troops provoked anger among white Charlestonians.  On farms and plantations across the South, black soldiers represented freedom for the slaves.</p>              <p>Although Colonel Shaw's leadership of the Fifty-fourth was brief, his men responded to his death by raising money for the construction of a monument in his honor.  Success finally crowned their efforts with the dedication of the Robert Gould Shaw Memorial in Boston on May 31, 1897.  In discussing the generosity of colored troops, Egerton fails to mention that many of them enthusiastically contributed to a fund to construct a monument to the memory of Abraham Lincoln who was the architect of the black army.  Several dignitaries including President Ulysses S. Grant attended the unveiling of the Freedmen's National Monument in Washington on April 14, 1876, twenty-one years before the unveiling of the Shaw Memorial.</p>        <p>The soldiers of the 54th, the 55th, and the 5th Cavalry exhibited the same tenacity in the fight to win their political rights after the war that they had displayed on the battlefield for two years.  The veterans of the Bay State regiments found injustice and oppression as deeply entrenched in American life after the war as the Confederate positions they had attacked during the conflict.  The author convincingly reminds us that racism did not end with the collapse of the Confederacy, but endured down through the years to the present.  Egerton concludes that the men of the Massachusetts regiments ""had stood their ground when faced by formidable odds at James Island, at Wagner, at Honey Hill, and at Olustee, and they were not about to be intimidated by white conservatives who wished to restore the antebellum social and political order"" (306-307). The success of the Massachusetts regiments taught the nation that the color of a person's skin was not an obstacle to achieving excellence.  <i>Thunder at the Gates</i> is a significant addition to the literature on African American troops of the Civil War.  Egerton's historical record of the Massachusetts Fifty-fourth, Fifty-fifth, and Fifth Cavalry is a noteworthy accomplishment.</p>  <p><i>Leonne M.

6449	9780823271825	$35.00	Northern Character: College-Educated New Englanders, Honor, Nationalism, and Leadership in the Civil War Era		Wongsrichanalai, Kanisorn			"Patrician Leaders: New England's Men of Character and the Civil War<p>In <i>Northern Character</i>, Kanisorn Wongsrichanalai tells the story of an influential cohort of college-educated northerners who served as Union officers during the Civil War and played a leading role in American public life during the postwar era.  This generation of ""New Brahmins"" included the likes of James A. Garfield, Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., Joshua L. Chamberlain, Oliver O. Howard, and Charles Russell Lowell.  Wongsrichanalai offers a fresh and compelling interpretation of these well-known figures by examining how their ideas about character and nationalism, forged during their college years, guided them throughout their adult lives.</p>  <p>Wongsrichanalai challenges scholarly narratives that portray honor culture as primarily a southern phenomenon.  New Brahmins, he argues, had an honor code of their own.  As young men, they internalized an ideal of gentlemanly character that emphasized independent thought, self-sacrifice, and self-control.  Their identity as men of character influenced their decisions about military service, their conduct as officers, their perceptions of white southerners and slaves, and their attitudes toward Reconstruction.</p><p><i>Northern Character</i> begins by examining the social and intellectual world that young men encountered at Harvard, Yale, Dartmouth, Amherst, and other New England colleges during the 1850s.  Although the proliferation of colleges made higher education more accessible to northern youth during the antebellum decades, colleges continued to cultivate a fundamentally conservative and elitist worldview.  Through their coursework, young men came to attribute the nation's troubles to selfish politicians, who found it all too easy to manipulate a poorly educated citizenry.  In order ensure the success of America's republican experiment, New Brahmins believed, it was imperative for men of character to take the reins of national leadership.</p><p>Northern colleges also promoted a ""New England-centric vision"" of America's national character, history, and destiny (37).  New Brahmins learned that Yankee industry and love of liberty had made the United States the pinnacle of Western civilization.  While northern collegians were generally suspicious of radical abolitionism, they saw slavery as a blight on the nation, because it undermined the industry of slaveholders and diminished opportunities for free laborers.  Only by extending free labor over the entire nation could the United States achieve its mission to promote liberty and democracy the world over.</p> <p>When the Civil War erupted in 1861, Union officials faced a shortage of experienced officers.  They responded by turning to college-educated men, who seemed to possess the discipline and leadership abilities necessary to prepare soldiers for combat.  Although their elders often sought to dissuade them from volunteering, many New Brahmins believed that it was their duty as men of character to risk their lives to preserve the Union and advance their free-labor vision.  Despite their professed commitment to self-sacrifice, however, young elites also saw military service as an opportunity to secure their rightful place as societal leaders.  Intent on maintaining their class status during wartime, they often went to great lengths to secure commissions as officers rather than joining the rank and file.</p><p>On the battlefront, New Brahmins' notions about character colored their impressions of the South and its people.  While they admired the beauty of the southern landscape, they often decried the region's untapped economic potential and the indolence of white southerners and slaves.  In one of the most insightful parts of the book, Wongsrichanalai contends that New Brahmins drew a false distinction between the unseen slaveholders who led the movement for secession, and the officers and soldiers whom they confronted in battle.  They blamed the former for impeding the region's development through their reliance on slavery, and neglecting their responsibility to uplift poor whites.  By contrast, New Brahmins often expressed admiration for their Confederate counterparts across the battlefield, who seemed to share their commitment to courage, self-sacrifice, and gentlemanly behavior.</p><p>As officers, genteel northerners sought to use rigid discipline to cultivate character among their troops.  According to Wongsrichanalai, the hierarchy and discipline of the Union army allowed these young elites to realize their vision of an ideal society, ""in which everyday individuals obeyed orders from their social superiors"" (141).  Although Wongsrichanalai notes that they achieved ""mixed results"" on the battlefield, he presents a favorable assessment of their ability to prepare troops for battle, maintain their composure under fire, and earn the trust of their subordinates (162).  For the most part, however, New Brahmins' wartime experiences did little to alter their ethnic, racial, and class prejudices.  Even as they witnessed the valor of black soldiers on the battlefield, for example, they often continued to see African Americans as innately deficient in character.</p><p>After the war, as New Brahmins assumed positions of power in government, the military, and the professions, they quickly grew ambivalent about Reconstruction.  On the one hand, many supported the establishment of constitutional protections for black citizenship rights and the use of the Freedmen's Bureau to educate former slaves.  On the other hand, their aversion to radicalism, identification with southern elites, and concerns about governmental overreach led them to push for speedy reconciliation with the South's ""natural leaders"" (17).  Furthermore, the scandals of the Grant administration convinced many New Brahmins that the federal government had fallen into the hands of the same type of corrupt politicians who had led the nation astray during the antebellum era.  Some worked to reform the Republican Party from within; others bolted for the Liberal Republican movement.  Increasingly, however, New Brahmins withdrew from electoral politics altogether, dedicating themselves to founding schools, working as lawyers and judges, and participating in various reform movements.</p><p>Throughout Northern Character, Wongsrichanalai deftly weaves together a wealth of source material from the letters, diaries, college essays, speeches, and published writings of forty-nine New Brahmins.  These sources allow him to present a rich portrait of his subjects' views and motives, but they provide fewer insights into how other historical actors perceived and responded to these self-styled men of character.  In analyzing New Brahmins' conduct as officers, for example, Wongsrichanalai offers only one intriguing example of how a rank-and-file soldier viewed his commanding officer.  Consequently, it is difficult for the reader to evaluate how New Brahmins' assessment of their own character and leadership comported with the assessments of those who followed them into battle.  Northern Character is nevertheless an impressive scholarly achievement.  Engagingly written and convincingly argued, the book holds important insights for scholars interested in the cultural roots of sectional conflict, the social dynamics of the Union army, and the postwar movements for reconciliation and liberal reform.</p><p><i>William Wagner is an Assistant Professor in the History Department at the University of Colorado Denver.

6611	9780807167472	$45.00	On to Petersburg: Grant and Lee, June 4-15, 1864		Gordon, Rhea C.			"Petersburg and the Strategy of Persistence       <p>Author Gordon Rhea has something of a cottage industry going with regard to Virginia's so-called ""Overland Campaign"" of the spring/summer 1864.  His fifth in series on the subject (sixth or seventh if one counts several ancillary works), concludes the saga of Grant and Lee forever side-slipping southward from the Rapidan to the James in adroit thrust and parry, constantly entrenching or probing for openings and most of all -- bloody, inconclusive head-to-head battles that only perpetuated the carnage people associate especially with ""Butcher"" Grant.  If one is a student of detailed tactical/operational analysis, leadership, tactics and the implementation of field fortifications foretelling the Western Front in World War I, then Rhea's books are perfect.  To his signature narrative style, almost a literal replication of Grant's dogged foot by foot pace, he adds a modicum of illustrations, useful operational maps and orders of battle and fittingly offers a short campaign perspective in this final series' volume. This is traditional military history -- battles and leaders with injection of personal observations from all ranks.  Rhea offers sound (although hardly profound) judgement on Grant and Lee, where each one and his army succeeded or failed at critical junctures.  This is not Bruce Catton, K.P. or T. Harry Williams even Douglas Southall Freeman from yesteryear.   They are available from used bookstores and remain staples of Civil War scholarship.  Rhea invites a fresh approach for studying the anatomy of leadership, organizations and procedures in an evolving way of war.</p>        <p>Rhea's work does less with high command, the contextual background of the fortnight he covers in terms of integrative political, economic, socio-cultural background.  But, he is superb at weaving a portrait of educating Grant to eastern army ways, the frictions of army group command, foibles and eccentricities of the Army of the Potomac in particular and why Grant could afford battlefield butchery and Lee could not!  Lee comes under less scrutiny perhaps and, at times, the narrative is briefly repetitive for knowledgeable readers.  Let's face it, Rhea is best at operational detail.  Correspondingly, one wishes for similar treatment of the logistics crucial for better understanding the unfolding events.</p>      <p>Nevertheless, here is the mesmerizing post-Cold Harbor phase of the war, when the Army of the Potomac raced to cross the James and beat its foe to Petersburg so cutting invaluable supply lines from the deeper south.  Ironically, this stratagem was precisely what McClellan had evolved two years earlier only to be stymied by Washington war lords. Now, it was Grant's turn to win President Lincoln's confidence and he did so by persistence and determination, advancing not retreating in the face of adversity and by determining Lee's army was not at Richmond was his true objective.  Therefore, as we know, Grant's story was one of persistence - the essence of Rhea's multi-volume study -- at the cost of blood and treasure.  The Union juggernaut kept going to Lee's detriment.  It attritted itself but more so Lee's army which was Grant's objective, not Richmond.  Yet, Lee's valiant men hung on, the Lost Cause incarnate.  <p>Rhea arguably suggests virtually limitless resources lay behind Grant's purposes but not so for Lee.  Nonetheless, resources have to be mobilized, a political act requiring public will and stamina.  Here is where Rhea's approach leaves the reader unsatisfied. The evolving spring and summer of 1864 was political.  Success for Union arms faced a timetable and that timetable climaxed a few months hence with elections.  Grant and the armies of the Republic (for he commanded and directed many, not just the Army of the Potomac), could not afford to play the Confederate game of waiting out survival at northern polls. High casualties did little to endear Grant, or Lincoln, to voters across the Union. Success did affect public opinion and Grant determined its meaning by pushing past setbacks like the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, North Anna, Cold Harbor and a myriad of other combat encounters that constituted this  campaign. Success could be measured back home by what today we call ""endless war"" --the fact that Grant did not allow eastern armies to retreat as they had in previous encounters. In so doing, Grant hamstrung Lee's control of events, counter-offensive flexibility and drained the Confederacy of ability to supply guns and butter to its minions.  Rhea doesn't do much with this theme, so, in some ways, his most enduring themes revolve around Grant's decision to travel with the Army of the Potomac and beat it into a decisive force to win the war.</p> <p>Uneven analysis of Northern and Southern commands is one of the book's only shortcomings. For example, Rhea pinpoints deficiencies in Grant's communication of strategic intent to subordinates by describing the somewhat faulty and inadequate attempt at unity of command between Army of the Potomac commander George Gordon Meade and Army of the James leader politico-general Benjamin Butler. In contrast, Rhea readily attributes Lee's command shortcomings to wounded, ill, and superseded corps commanders or maladies that left the Confederate commander unable to judge his opponent's intentions, abilities, method and determination.</p> <p>In all of this recounting, Rhea is adequate for his purpose.  His portrayal of the roles of respective commanders-in-chief Lincoln and Davis (or their war administrations) remains opaque and we do not gain real appreciation of logistics and army-navy cooperation nor really a thorough scrub of the Overland Campaign (surely the subject for a whole capstone volume of its own).  Even some snapshot of the political, economic, and socio-cultural (not to mention diplomatic) implications for both sides in the first few weeks of June would have been welcome.  Moreover, since war is an extension of politics and the first part of June was central to Lincoln's re-nomination (and, by extension, Confederate survival and independence), surely in-depth evaluation of home front impact of the bloodletting to date would have added to the context. Nonetheless, Rhea's contribution to modern Civil War military scholarship is laudable.  Whether campaign scholarship now demands a more holistic approach prompts our consideration.</p>     <p><i>Benjamin Franklin Cooling is a Professor of National Security Studies at the National Defense University in Washington, D.C.</i></p>"	Cooling, Benjamin Franklin	Winter 2018	2018-2-1	Review			LSU Press		Battles;Front_Center;Military			"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=243 alt=\""Product Cover\"" border=0 src=\""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/petersburg.jpg\"">"							
6627	9780700624874	$29.95	The Election of 1860: A Campaign Fraught with Consequences		Holt, Michael F.			"Politics of Consequence: The Many Campaigns of 1860<p>The election of 1860 has garnered an enormous amount of attention from scholars because of its weighty implications.  Historians of the Civil War era invariably earmark this political contest as America's most important presidential election in classroom lectures and in one monograph after another for good reason.  The outcome of the election triggered the secession of seven Lower South states, invoked a turbulent political battle between fire-eaters and unionists in the eight remaining slaveholding states, and led directly to the mighty conflict that saw the destruction of slavery and the death of some 750,000 American soldiers.  In the last decade alone, Douglas S. Egerton and Michael S. Green have produced fine studies of the four man race, while a host of prolific scholars contributed essays on the election in a 2013 volume edited by A. James Fuller.  Despite his admitted initial misgivings about being able to add anything of significance to the story of the Republican triumph in 1860, Michael F. Holt has once again rewarded readers with <i>The Election of 1860: ""A Campaign Fraught with Consequences""</i>, the latest addition to the University Press of Kansas's American Presidential Elections series.  With his skillful analysis, numerous penetrating insights, and multiple thought-provoking conclusions, Holt offers up a fresh account that challenges some old assumptions about this landmark contest.</p>     	<p>Abraham Lincoln and the victorious Republicans rightfully have enthralled many scholars of the 1860 contest, but Holt worries that the giant shadow cast by the Railsplitter candidate has left some aspects of the election ignored and unexplored.  To remedy this historiographical shortcoming, Holt devotes equal consideration to the other political organizations and candidates and treats the embryonic Constitutional Union Party -- which some writers have dismissed as nothing more than a stopgap measure concocted by desperate Upper South conservatives -- as a serious contender with historical roots dating back to the 1850 crisis of the Union.  Over eight topical chapters Holt provides a brief primer of each of the parties, carries readers to the raucous summertime conventions where politicos traded favors and debated candidates and platforms, opens a window on the exciting campaign efforts of each organization, and carefully scrutinizes the outcome of the contest.  Three appendices include vital statistical data, election returns, each party's finalized national platform, and a transcript of Lincoln's March 4, 1861 inaugural address.</p>     	<p>In order to provide an evenhanded discussion of the contest and in an effort to prevent an overreliance on major newspapers like the <i>New York Tribune</i>, Holt sifted through rather obscure sheets like the Milledgeville, Georgia <i>Southern Recorder</i> and the <i>Bangor Whig and Courier</i>.  Such an approach provides Holt with a diverse cross-section of American voters' concerns, desires, and needs, and provides balance to the oft-quoted voices of major New York-based editors like Henry J. Raymond and James Gordon Bennett.</p>     <p>Probing this wide swath of newspapers led Holt to the conclusion that the main issue at play in the election of 1860 was the fate of the Union rather than the imbroglio over slavery's extension into the territories.  Moreover, he finds that the Republicans and the Constitutional Unionists consistently stressed the corruption and malfeasance of Democrat James Buchanan\'s administration when reaching out to voters.  Holt contends that with the defeat of the Lecompton Constitution, Republicans realized that slavery could not realistically spread to any of the remaining western territories and therefore party bosses emphasized other matters in the campaign to attract voters, especially those in the Lower North.Republican leaders therefore played up Democratic graft, marginalized the influence of the opponents of nativism like William Seward, and spun the Chicago Platform's ambiguous statement on trade policy into an endorsement of higher tariff rates in order to convert Lower North moderates, especially in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, to their standard.  Much of this crucial voting bloc had gone for American Party candidate Millard Fillmore in 1856 and on the eve of the contest in 1860 stood ready to vote for someone other than the Republicans, whom they perceived as dangerous sectional radicals whose policies would rend the Union.  By soft-pedaling the slavery extension issue, the Republicans won the election.  Holt insists that only southern Democrats sought to make slavery's extension the paramount issue during the campaign and he disagrees with James Oakes's recent contention that by 1860 most Republicans not only wanted to restrict slavery's spread, but also ensure its abolition in the southern states.</p>     <p>One of the major strengths of this book is the way in which Holt ties together the campaigns of the Democrats, Constitutional Unionists, and Republicans.  He reminds us that these parties did not operate within a vacuum.  Rather, party leaders were quite in tune to the decisions of their opponents, and this influenced their own choices about platforms and candidates.  He expertly traces the developments at the national party conventions during the spring and summer of 1860 and shows how the breakup of the Democratic Party impacted the other political organizations.  For instance, some leaders of the Constitutional Union Party, whose national convention met a week prior to the Republicans' Chicago meeting, initially operated under the assumption that a unified Democratic Party would place Stephen Douglas at the top of its ticket.  These Constitutional Unionists hoped to bolster their chances to defeat the Democrats and force the hand of the Republicans by nominating a moderate candidate that the delegates to the Chicago Convention also would place on their ticket.  By the time the Constitutional Unionists met, however, the Democratic smashup had occurred at Charleston and it seemed a real possibility that Douglas would not win his party's nomination when it once again gathered later in June.  With this in mind, Constitutional Unionists believed it easier to attract the support of the moderate followers of the Little Giant and therefore abandoned any attempt to work with the Republicans.  However unlikely the possibility of a fusion between Constitutional Unionists and Republicans seems in hindsight, Holt convincingly demonstrates that prior to the fracturing of the Democratic Party during the summer of 1860 some politicos believe such a scenario might come to fruition.</p>     	<p>Although Holt shows throughout the book the many ways in which the disparate parties emphasized considerations other than slavery's extension into the western territories, the explosive issue always lurks in the background of his narrative and at times bursts to the forefront of his discussion.  This suggests that many contemporaries probably found it much more difficult to compartmentalize or differentiate concerns about preservation of the Union and slavery than does the twenty-first century historian.  The great lengths to which the Republicans went to downplay the slavery extension issue indicates that party leaders understood it was never far from the mind of the American voter.  Northern moderates who cast their ballots for the Republicans surely realized that in 1860 they now supported a party devoted to cleaning up Democratic corruption and dedicated to free soil in the West.  As Holt astutely points out, the Constitutional Union Party wished ""to bury the slavery issue"" and keep it out of future political discussion (76-77).  One could argue, however, that all four organizations hoped that their respective responses to slavery's extension would permanently put the issue to bed.  Whether advocating popular sovereignty, calling for a territorial slave code, or adhering to a call for free soil, leaders of each organization surmised they advocated the only solution to end political agitation on the subject and in turn, preserve the Union.</p>     	<p>In this book Holt has once again proven his masterful understanding of nineteenth-century American politics and his intrinsic ability to craft a lively, insightful, and entertaining narrative.  Readers who pick up <i>The Election of 1860</i> may not agree with all of Holt's conclusions, but they will surely come away with an enhanced understanding of the dynamics of the American political system on the eve of the Civil War.</p>     <p><i>Michael Robinson is an assistant professor of history at the University of Mobile and the author of </i>A Union Indivisible: Secession and the Politics of Slavery in the Border South<i>.</i></p>"	Robinson, Michael	Winter 2018	2018-2-1	Review			University Press of Kansas		Politics			"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=243 alt=\""Product Cover\"" border=0 src=\""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/election1860holt.jpg\"">"

"Public Lands, Coercion, and the Revival of San Francisco Vigilance Committee<p>This book originated in a fortuitous discovery.  In 2006, while researching another project in the papers of nineteenth-century journalist and historian Theodore S. Hittell (archived at the Sutro Library, a branch of the California State Library), historian Nancy J. Taniguichi stumbled across a previously unknown transcript of the minutes of the Executive Committee (known to contemporaries as ""the Executives"") of the 1856 San Francisco Vigilance Committee (the ""VC"").  Nineteenth-century historians had cited this source, which was closely guarded by former vigilantes, but the original went missing years ago.  It turns out, however, that journalist and historian Theodore S. Hittell made a working copy, which remained entombed among his papers for more than a century until Taniguichi recognized it for what it was.  She is the first modern historian to utilize this important source, which provides inside view of the operations of the VC. </p><p>Vigilantism was central to the history of Gold Rush San Francisco.  In 1851, responding to what many San Franciscans perceived as a wave of arson, robbery, and murder, prominent citizens organized a Committee of Vigilance (the ""COV""), which eventually counted several hundred members.  The COV detained and interrogated dozens of suspects, many of them Australian migrants, refusing them the protections of legal due process.  The committee hanged four men and forced another twenty-eight into exile before disbanding three months later.  Although its members were guilty of kidnap and murder, no charge or indictment was ever brought against any of them.</p><p>San Francisco continued to be a turbulent place, and over the next few years there were frequent calls for the revival of the committee.  By 1856, a year characterized by market panics and bank failures, the perception of social chaos was palpable.  The city was ""shingled over"" with competing land claims, and there were violent conflicts between purported owners and militant squatters.  Nativists, including members of the ascendant American Party (the so-called ""Know Nothings"") challenged Irish and Catholic residents who supported the city's Democratic political machine.  James King, flamboyant editor of a local newspaper, railed against political corruption and condemned the failure of police and the courts to effectively respond to what he asserted was a tidal wave of criminality.  When an outraged county supervisor named James Casey shot and killed editor King on the street, the powder keg ignited.  Casey was immediately arrested and the authorities promised a speedy trial, but a large and angry mob demanded his immediate execution.  A group of powerful merchants and bankers reorganized the old committee as the VC, this time with several thousand members.  Acting under orders from the Executives, armed vigilantes forced their way into the jail and seized Casey along with another accused murderer.  Following a secret trail the two men were hanged before a crowd of several thousand.</p><p>The VC controlled San Francisco for eleven weeks during the summer of 1856.  The committee was considerably more ambitious than its predecessor, systematically employing blacklisting, kidnapping, secret trials, close confinement, banishment, and execution to achieve their goal of remaking the city's political culture.  Two more men were hanged and twenty-three others -- most of them political associates of David Broderick, leader of the city's Democrats -- were forcibly transported out of the state and warned not to return under pain of death.  A large but unknown number voluntarily fled the city to avoid arrest.  The California governor condemned the movement as an ""insurrection, "" but faction and division prevented any effective response.  Acting under orders from the Executives, vigilantes seized an official shipment of arms intended for the city's ""Law and Order"" militia.  The VC became the nucleus of a new political organization, the ""Peoples' Party, "" which triumphed in the subsequent municipal election and continued to run the city for another decade. </p><p>During its reign the VC received mostly positive coverage from the press.  The first historians of the movement -- Hubert Howe Bancroft and Theodore S. Hittell -- told the story largely as the vigilantes wanted it told:  that politicians in league with criminals had so misgoverned San Francisco that nothing but vigilantism could cure the city of its ills.  But modern historians -- Richard Maxwell Brown, Peter Decker, Robert Senkewicz, and Philip J. Ethington among them -- have systematically dismantled that interpretation.  They find that crime was not the problem the vigilantes claimed it to be, that the courts were operating effectively, that municipal politics were not especially corrupt, and that charges of electoral fraud and political violence were greatly exaggerated.  Senkewicz, in what remains the best history of the San Francisco vigilantes, effectively argues that the appeal of the movement can be best explained by the boom and bust economy of the city that smashed the hopes of thousands.  The VC gave them a cause to fight for, something to feel proud about, something to fill their idle days. </p><p>Taniguchi largely agrees with this interpretation.  Using the minutes of the Executives, she provides a great deal of detail -- sometimes tedious detail -- about the operations of the VC, its arbitrary and capricious rules, its favoritism, and its cruelties.  The Executives were constantly running short of money, with mounting costs and relatively little cash on hand.  They frequently had to go to wealthy supporters for contributions, even turning to what Taniguchi calls ""the always vulnerable Chinese"" (pp. 125, 185) -- perhaps the Six Companies, she doesn't specify. </p><p>But as the title of her book indicates, Taniguchi also has a new thesis.  The minutes, she asserts, reveals that the Executives were not simply attempting to reform the city but were acting in their own ""economic self-interest"" (p. xv).  Their fortunes depended on control of the San Francisco waterfront with its warves and warehouses, and they felt directly threatened by the ongoing struggle between contesting claimants for those properties.  The struggle the VC waged against the Democrats, she argues, was largely motivated by the land claims of David Broderick and his political operatives.  ""Destroy Broderick's political power and get the waterfront land"" (p. xvi).  This was the secret goal of the Executives, she argues, a fact they ""carefully hid . . . from their own Committee members, who would not have profited as their leaders did"" (p. 11). </p><p>Taniguchi's best evidence is the effort the Executives made to acquire the ""Pueblo Papers, "" a cache of documents from the Mexican period that supposedly established the corporate rights of the city to issue grants of property.  Title to the Executives' waterfront properties traced back to city grants, so this right, taken at face value, invalidated all other claims. In fact, San Francisco (or rather Yerba Buena, its successor) had never been an official ""pueblo, "" and had no such corporate right.  Nevertheless, the Executives went after the papers with a vengeance, arresting the man who had acquired them and holding him incommunicado until he finally agreed to a sale for several thousand dollars. Taniguchi argues that the Executives deliberately extended the life of the VC -- with two more men hanged as a result -- in order to obtain these papers.  The payment -- done without consulting the membership -- drained the organization's coffers and sapped its energy.  No previous historian has tied the VC to the contentious issue of land claims, and Taniguchi's contribution here is important. </p><p>This evidence, however, will not support Taniguchi's contention that the struggle over ""dirty deeds"" was the founding motivation of the Vigilance Committee.  The property question comes up in the Executive minutes, but no more than other issues.  The collection of miscellaneous VC materials at the Huntington Library, which I have examined, document all the effort that went into compiling blacklists and investigating those who were listed, as well as the attention given to voter fraud and ballot stuffing.  Yet there is almost nothing in that collection that concerns the question of land.  ""The full story is revealed, "" Taniguchi asserts.  ""Perhaps now the complete story of America's largest vigilance committee and its objectives will be remembered for what it was"" (p. xviii).  Despite the considerable contributions of the book, that is a step too far. </p><p><i>John Mack Faragher</i></p><p><i>Yale University</i></p>

"Race and the Right to Consume	<p><i>The Retreats of Reconstruction</i> by David E. Goldberg traces the rise of <i>de facto</i> segregation in the leisure spaces of the Jersey Shore in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The book, a revision of Goldberg's award winning dissertation, illuminates the complexity of black and white approaches to racial access to northern boardwalks, beaches, baths and businesses by focusing on how debates about segregation and integration played out against the backdrop of a changing free market economy that was increasingly focused on consumption, especially in these places of leisure. Relying largely on promotional materials and editorials in northern newspapers, Goldberg shows the way in which Jim Crow restrictions slowly developed in the decades after the Civil War, and he illuminates the role that white and black consumers, businessmen, and local leaders played in the emergence of segregated leisure spaces in the North.</p> <p>The book begins with a discussion of how both white and black northerners framed their arguments regarding segregation in the context of consumer power. White business leaders on the Jersey shore claimed that they needed to honor social mores regarding racial boundaries in order to appease white consumers, while black activists who pressed for integration in the years after the Civil War argued that they had the ""right to consume"" and that racial restrictions were, in fact, an infringement on the free market. Local officials wanted to avoid racial conflict as well as honor the emancipationist legacy of the Civil War, and so they were reluctant to enforce strict rules regarding segregation. The result of this situation was that business leaders encouraged social segregation by posting signs that made requests or suggestions about racial access to certain areas. In taking such a position, they appeased neither black consumers who wanted equal access nor white tourists who wanted more sharply segregated spaces. The amorphous policies on the Jersey shore led to a wave of black consumer activism demanding integration, which in turn led to white appeals to social etiquette to justify segregation. By the turn of the century unofficial segregation policies proliferated and black activists changed their strategy from one that promoted integration to an emphasis on boycotts of white businesses. In doing so they, in effect, sanctioned the idea of ""separate but equal"" by promoting black-owned businesses and encouraging regulations that would ensure their profitability and safety.</p><p>Thus by the 1920s, Goldberg argues, black and white elites had together helped to create a consumer driven culture that acknowledged <i>de facto</i> segregation as a norm. According to his analysis, the emphasis on the right to consumption had ultimately aided the cause of segregation as black activists ceased their demands for integration and withdrew to their own spaces. Their emphasis on consumer rights, rather than on social justice, had become a trap that distracted them from demands for full social equality with equal access to all spaces.</p> <p>Goldberg's work is an important contribution to our understanding of American race relations in the in the decades after the Civil War. Not only does it develop our understanding of how segregation became entrenched in the northern states, it shows that the emergence of <i>de facto</i> segregation in places like the Jersey Shore cannot solely be explained by a simple acknowledgement of white racism. Goldberg's research demonstrates that racial politics were intricately intertwined with the rise of a consumer-oriented economy and were defined by competing ideas about free enterprise and the right to consume.</p> <p><i>Angela F.

6463	9780252082047	$28.00	Black Girlhood in the Nineteenth Century		Wright, Nazera Sadiq			"Re-examining the Literature:African American Girls and the Question of Racial Progress in the Nineteenth Century	<p>Literary scholar Nazera Sadiq Wright's aptly titled and powerfully written work <i>Black Girlhood in the Nineteenth Century</i> explores depictions of African American girls found within American newspapers, novels, and conduct manuals during one of the most racially turbulent periods in the nation's history. Drawing on a wide variety of fiction and non-fiction sources, Wright chronicles the development of black girls in literature from the onset of the country's first black newspaper in 1827 through the early years of the twentieth century. As this meticulously researched book demonstrates, African American communities underwent tremendous change during this time, witnessing the abolition of slavery, the hope of Reconstruction, as well as the devastation wreaked on black neighborhoods through de facto discrimination and institution of Jim Crow laws. In response, black men and women across the United States sought diverse strategies for challenging the effects of racism and asserting their claims to citizenship. African American writers and editors, in particular, the author contends, frequently discussed and debated such strategies for racial progress on the page, a technique that was not lost upon an increasingly literate black public. Expertly weaving literary and historical analysis in her review of prominent as well as lesser-known nineteenth century texts, Wright argues that black girls bore a special responsibility in the literature of the day, becoming a mode through which the African American literary elite could present and negotiate their hopes and anxieties about, as well as strategies for, the continued advancement of the race. While Wright's deep archival research insures a compelling discussion of diverse works written throughout the nineteenth century, her analysis shines most brightly in her chapters on antebellum black girlhood, the emergence of Gertrude Bustill Mossell's advice column published in the <i>New York Freeman</i>, as well as depictions of African American girls that appeared in black conduct manuals in the early decades of the American century.</p> <p>Throughout this work and in her chapters on antebellum girlhood, in particular, Wright distinguishes between texts written by male and female authors, asserting that while the former often presented black girls in their idealized forms, African American female authors grappled more forthrightly with the harsh realities that dominated the lives of black girls during this period. These difficult circumstances, the violence of slavery and the threat of sexual assault, Wright asserts, curtailed the childhood of many African American girls, forcing them to transition very quickly from youthful innocence to a state of ""premature knowing"" (61) in order to protect themselves. Centering her discussion on the works of Maria W. Stewart, Harriet Wilson, and Harriet Jacobs, Wright successfully demonstrates the manner in which the young protagonists of such texts embraced imperfect behaviors and the power of their individual will in ways that privileged survival over Victorian standards of female propriety. In both Stewart's ""The First Stage of Life"" and Harriet Wilson's <i>Our Nig</i>, Wright suggests, the central figures Letitia and Frado only become fully realized when they make the decision to advocate on their own behalf. For Letitia, this exercise of will emanates through her decision to pursue a religious education, while for Frado, it is best illustrated in her unwillingness to sustain further beatings from her employer, Mrs. Bellmont. Perhaps most compelling is Wright's discussion of the protagonist Linda Brent in Harriet Jacobs's autobiographical work, <i>Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl</i>, in which Brent becomes privy to the sexual victimization of black women as a result of the predations of her master, Mr. Flint. Rather than capitulate to her master's desires, Brent uses her ""premature knowing"" to engage in a relationship with a neighboring white man, hoping this sexual union will protect her from the advances of Mr. Flint. In doing so, Wright contends, Brent asserts her will and reclaims the effects of her truncated childhood, utilizing its hard lessons to insure the survival of both herself and her family. Although not written for expressly didactic purposes, these works do much to illustrate the power of alternative models of African American girlhood, ones in which, Wright asserts, black girls were encouraged to take their futures, and by extension, the future of the race into their own hands.</p> <p>Wright makes a similar argument in her discussion of Gertrude Bustill Mossell's advice column ""Our Women's Department"" which appeared in <i>New York Freeman</i> in the latter years of the 1880s. Although the period following the Civil War brought many political as well as literary transformations to the black community, Wright asserts that Mossell, like her predecessors, continued to address the daily concerns and challenges of life for black girls in the post-Reconstruction era. Wright's focus on the emphasis Mossell placed on the working lives of African American girls is deserving of special mention. Within this chapter, the author argues that Mossell, rather than espousing the values of feminine domesticity, an elusive goal for many black communities struggling with the effects of a discriminatory labor market, instead celebrated the economic contributions of black girls to their families, offering advice and counsel for navigating the difficulties of employment. Notably, the stress Mossell places on the importance of thrift and economical housekeeping, Wright illustrates, reveals the columnist's attention to the growing industrial economy and increased opportunities for girls' spending that threatened the financial stability of black homes. Additionally, Mossell also provided guidance for black girls engaged in domestic service which, as Wright indicates, served as one of the largest employment sectors for African American girls and women in the nineteenth century. While Wright notes Mossell's attention to the significance of financial security, she also demonstrates the writer's insistence that black girls be treated with dignity and respect in their places of employment. Citing an article published in January 1886, Wright points to Mossell's admonition of white employers, indicating that all Americans shudder at the thought of exploitative servitude and that domestic workers deserve to be treated ""more as if they are human beings and less like brutes"" (106). Through Mossell's rebuke of employers, Wright suggests that the columnist was also tacitly signaling to black girls the kinds of treatment they should and should not tolerate both within their working lives, as well in their daily engagement with the larger public sphere. As such, Wright's analysis reveals that Mossell's advice column sought to provide a roadmap for African American progress by tailoring her message to black girls, the youngest and seemingly most vulnerable of these communities, but whose promise and fortitude, columnist assured, would dictate the trajectory of the race.</p> <p>In her final chapter, Wright explores the prominence of black conduct manuals in the early twentieth century, convincingly arguing that such texts placed a particular emphasis on the role that African American girls played in the campaign for racial uplift, a role that writers feared could either support or upend black progress. Wright also notes that such manuals marked a distinctive shift in the ways black girlhood was discussed and defined during this period, as girls were expected by black conduct writers to behave in ways that emphasized their domesticity, modesty, and submissiveness. Focusing primarily on Silas X. Floyd's popular manual, <i>Floyd's Flowers</i>, which was reprinted numerous times throughout the Progressive era, Wright asserts that black intellectuals created such manuals in response to the increased racial discrimination that proliferated throughout the United States in the decades following Reconstruction. Within conduct manuals, Wright argues, black girls were often reduced to character types that would either challenge or confirm the racist stereotypes that plagued African American communities. Such character types included: ""The Dutiful Girl,"" ""The Don't Care Girl,"" and ""The Loud Girl."" The expectations held for ""The Dutiful Girl,"" the paragon of respectable black girlhood in <i>Floyd's Flowers</i>, Wright notes, portrays young women, both literally and visually, as educated, modestly dressed, and domestically demur. This emphasis on a submissive feminine ideal, while designed to protect black girls and the larger black community from charges of impropriety, sexual or otherwise, Wright suggests, also deprived black girls of their right to be fully human and to, in the throes of adolescence, test the bounds of acceptable behavior and dress. In making this connection to adolescence clear, Wright implicitly recalls the experiences of black girls in antebellum texts who, by virtue of their ""premature knowing"" were also deprived of a full childhood, and thrust into the realities, behaviors, and expectations of adulthood far too soon. Together, Wright's attention to and deep analysis of these turn-of-the-century conduct manuals illustrates the centrality of responsible and respectable girlhood to the racial uplift ideology advocated by black intellectuals, even as such depictions often curtailed the individual experiences of real black girls.</p>  <p>Nazera Sadiq Wright's artful study of African American girls in the nineteenth century makes a significant contribution to a growing field of scholarship. While historians such as Erica Ball and Michele Mitchell have also written compellingly on the roles of gender, literature, and the black press in the quest for full citizenship and racial uplift during this period, Wright expands upon this already formidable body of research, complicating our examinations of race, sex, and class, with the additional consideration of age. While historical scholars may bristle at Wright's contention that these nineteenth-century depictions hold significant implications for the way we discuss black girlhood in our own time, her message, in its most basic sense, holds true: that language and literature was and continues to be immensely powerful. As such, Nazera Sadiq Wright's <i>Black Girlhood in the Nineteenth Century</i> is an impressive achievement and will serve as important reading for literary and historical scholars, as well as anyone interested in the significant role of African American girls in the tumultuous decades that brought the Civil War, the abolition of slavery, and the unfulfilled promises of Reconstruction.</p><p><i>Marissa A.

6345	9781107421349	$29.99	Rethinking American Emancipation: Legacies of Slavery and the Quest for Black Freedom		Link, William A.	Broomall, James J		"Reconstruction Reconsidered	<p>How did American slavery end, and what meanings can be derived from its demise? What did emancipation mean both to emancipated, and to the country as a whole? How was emancipation both threatened and defended during the Reconstruction Era? In what ways is the historical memory of emancipation contested, and what do the nature of these remembrances signify? In <i>Rethinking American Emancipation: Legacies of Slavery and the Quest for Black Freedom</i>, editors William Link and James Broomall offer nine essays from an impressive lineup of scholars, both established and up and coming, who examine these and other questions. Divided into three parts -- Claiming Emancipation, Contesting Emancipation, and Remembering Emancipation -- the volume is well organized and ideal for classroom use. Link, a Professor of History at the University of Florida, is the author of numerous books on Southern history ranging from the antebellum era through modern conservatism, and Broomall, Assistant Professor at Shepherd University, has published multiple articles on the Civil War. These two noteworthy scholars have done a fine job in framing the volume around the contested narrative of emancipation. As they ask in page 2 of the introduction, ""was emancipation accomplished by political and military policies from above, or by self-emancipation from below? How important were slaves' actions versus those of Congress, the president, and military authorities?"" Considering emancipation from a variety of geographic and theoretical perspectives, the essays in the volume provide case studies to illuminate larger patterns in the contested terrain of emancipation and the malleable nature of freedom. </p> 	<p>Although the entire volume is excellent, the real strength lies in the middle section, Contesting Emancipation, which focuses on the competing definitions of emancipation. This section, featuring essays by Allison Fredette, Carole Emberton, and Justin Behrend, is innovative in its approach, ranging from Fredette's examination of changing gender roles in white households in to Behrend's analysis of the 1876 election in Concordia Parish, Louisiana. Fredette, an adjunct professor at Appalachian State University, uses a comparative approach, using emancipation's effects on white marriages as a lens to understand emancipation in Kentucky and Virginia. Fredette's close reading of marriages in Kentucky allows her to, as she says on page 95, ""shed light on the early construction of an altered white memory of emancipation."" Justin Behrend, Associate Professor at SUNY -- Geneseo, uses talk of re-enslavement during the 1876 election in Concordia Parish, Louisiana to reinforce the point that emancipation was a process, and ""not merely a definitive moment."" Behrend notes that racial political violence and the imposition of white supremacy meant freedpeople's fears of re-enslavement not were not unfounded. </p> 	<p>In the third section of the volume, Remembering Emancipation, the essay by Paul Ortiz of the University of Florida is particularly noteworthy. Ortiz globalizes the idea of emancipation, noting that African Americans saw emancipation not only as a struggle within the United States, but also as an international conflict. He notes that in 1825, African Americans gathered in Baltimore to commemorate the twentieth-first anniversary of Haitian independence, and newly free African Americans in South Carolina paid attention to events in Cuba and Mexico in the months following the Civil War. Although there have been some important exceptions, not enough has been done to examine African American's relationship to the Global South. Ortiz' essay, ranging from emancipatory internationalism to Jim Crow abroad is an important contribution to this conversation. </p> 	<p>A real strength of this entire volume is although the essays are stand-alone case studies, they are really in conversation with one another. Behrend's essay refers to Link and Ortiz, Yael Sternhell and Carole Emberton in separate essays engage Gregory F. Downs's essay, and Ortiz builds off of Emberton's essay. All too often, collections like this feel as if they are somewhat cobbled together. This volume's cohesiveness makes the reader feel as if they are in the middle of a top-flight conversation among experts in the field rather than reading separate contributions. This characteristic will be especially useful in the university classroom, as students can see historians engaging each other's work, building upon and critiquing arguments and bringing multiple perspectives to a single subject. As a professor, I plan on making great use of <i>Rethinking American Emancipation</i>, in both my undergraduate and graduate classes. As a scholar, the essays in this volume will shape my thinking for a long time to come. </p><p><i>Bryan M.

6403	9780717807536	$14.00	The Civil War in the United States		Marx, Karl; Engels,Friedrich	Zimmerman, Andrew		"Recovered Perspectives: Marx and Engels on the American Civil War<p>From the beginning of his research into political economy and working class history, Marx was fascinated by American politics. But by far his most intense period of engagement came in the 1850s and 60s, when he wrote for the American paper <i>New York Daily Tribune</i>, and then began covering the American Civil War for the European press. This was also the period when the two communists were in contact with many emigres from the failed European revolutions of 1848, including August Willich, an eventual Civil War hero, and Joseph Weydmeyer, publisher of Marx's <i>Eighteenth Brumaire</i>. </p>  <p>Marx and Engels wrote copious amounts about slavery and the Civil War in both private letters and public letters. They wrote about American affairs for European newspapers, like Vienna's <i>Die Presse</i>, about European responses to American affairs for the <i>Daily Tribune</i>, and their research also found its way into works of social theory, like Marx's <i>Capital</i>, as well as public addresses, such as those of the International Working Man's Association. </p>   <p>Andrew Zimmerman has done all of us the great favor of re-issuing these works in a new edition of <i>The Civil War in the United States: Karl Marx & Friedrich Engels</i>. The collection was first published in 1937 by Herbert M. Morais, under the pseudonym Richard Enmale. Morais was fired from Brooklyn College in 1941, a victim of a red-baiting inquiry into ""subversive activities"" in New York public education. Zimmerman's edition adds new selections from <i>Capital</i>, his own translations of some of Weydemeyer's writings, and concludes with a short summation by W.E.B. Dubois of Marx's approach to slavery and the Civil War. This new material, plus expert introductions to each section, give us a richer picture of Marx and Engels' work on the subject. </p>  <p>A few themes stand out. The first is that Marx and Engels were radical abolitionists. Roughly stated, Northern support for the Civil War divided along concern for the Union and desire to abolish slavery. Marx unequivocally cared about the latter. But he was also unsparing in his criticism of false friends. In private letters and columns for the <i>Daily Tribune</i>, Marx pillories the English press and middle-class abolitionists who, despite loudly proclaiming dislike of slavery, put most of their energy into arguing the war wasn't really about slavery. As Marx points out, not only had the South made clear the point of secession was to preserve slavery, but that the English bourgeoisie was doubly committed to slavery itself. ""As long as the English cotton manufactures depended on slave-grown cotton,"" he wrote in one <i>Daily Tribune</i> column, ""it could be truthfully asserted that they rested on a twofold slavery, the indirect slavery of the white man in England and the direct slavery of the black men on the other side of the Atlantic."" As this, and many other passages attest, what concerned Marx above all was servitude in all its forms. </p>  <p>Marx wove his historical views about the slave-origins of industrial capitalism, and his political insights into the nominally abolitionist English liberals' not-so-secret sympathy for the South, into an argument about the world-historic significance of the Civil War. Over time, the Civil War established the principle that war for emancipation was a great and noble thing and, for that very reason, exposed class prejudices the world over. It also promised to eliminate racial boundaries among classes that had stood in the way of a proper class-conscious movement. As he says in one of the selections from <i>Capital</i>, ""Labor cannot emancipate itself in the white skin where in the black it is branded."" </p>   <p>Another notable feature of this volume is that slavery and Civil War work their way deep into the development of Marx's social theory. Zimmerman includes classic passages from <i>Capital</i> in which we immediately see how saturated the theory is with servitude, human brutalization, and the distinction between different forms of bondage. In a passage from volume 3 of <i>Capital</i>, which Zimmerman doesn't include, Marx writes that ""if there were no difference between essence and appearance there would be no need for science."" Sometimes taken as a broad, disinterested theoretical claim, it is in fact best seen as a claim about the reason capitalist societies require a special kind of scientific analysis compared with others. As the passages that Zimmerman selects from Capital attest, Marx regularly compared wage-labor to slavery and serfdom because the latter were clear and transparent forms of enslavement. Nobody disputed that they were forms of servitude, while wage-labor was taken to be free labor. One of the central aims of <i>Capital</i> is to show that abolition is not emancipation. After a passage in which he describes how the true character of wage-labor is only apparent once slavery is abolished, Marx writes, ""The contract by which he sold to the capitalist his labor power proved, so to say, in black and white that he disposed of himself freely. The bargain concluded, it is discovered that he was no 'free agent,' that the time for which he is free to sell his labor is the time for which he is forced to sell it."" This subjection becomes only more intense once the wage-laborer is subject to the authority of the employer in the workplace, the site of Marx's most lurid descriptions of bodies tortured and tormented by the imperatives of accumulation. </p>   <p>But all of this is concealed under the appearance given off by voluntary contracts and paid compensation. ""In slave labor,"" Marx writes, ""all the slave's labor appears as unpaid labor. In wage labor, on the contrary, even surplus labor, or unpaid labor, appears as paid."" Again, it is one of the great virtues of Zimmerman's selections that these passages appear in his edition. They illuminate just how deeply Marx's social theory drew from the issues of the day and, in turn, the degree to which slavery was a continuous touchstone for his thinking about capitalism. </p>  <p>For scholars of Marx, Engels, and Marxism there is a further benefit to this collection. Both Marx and Engels were excited by the Emancipation Proclamation, but frustrated that, by 1863, the war remained a kind of 'constitutional' war. From the very beginning, Marx had hoped that the North would abolish slavery, declare the slaves free, and arm them, thereby shattering the Southern economy and opening a second front. By the middle of the war, both understood abolition and expropriation of Southern property -- not just in persons but also in land -- as not just a necessary turn towards 'revolutionary' means, but as the one thing that could justify the war in the first place. </p>   <p>But Marx and Engels came apart in their evaluation of the likelihood the war would take anything like a revolutionary turn in the North's favor. In a superbly edited fourth section of the collection, to which Zimmerman gives the title ""McClellan or Fremont? Constitutional or Revolutionary War,"" we are reminded that Marx and Engels should not be automatically lumped together, despite their close and continuous collaboration. Engels, the better and more experienced military strategist, poured over the military reports and maps of the South, only to fall into great doubts that the North would be able to win. As early as May 12, 1862, he was also worried that the North didn't have the stomach for the war: ""Where, amongst the people, is there any sign of revolutionary vigor?"" In a letter a month later, he again writes, ""They shrink from conscription""from attacking slavery."" Marx, in response, agreed that ""wars of this kind ought to be conducted along revolutionary lines,"" but that the ""Yankees have so far been trying to conduct it along constitutional ones."" </p>   <p>But Marx, ever the more attentive to political conditions than just military ones, explained to Engels that ""I don't quite share your views""I do not believe that all is up."" The reason was that, ""Northerners have been dominated by the representatives of the border slave states,"" but that the political dynamics of the war would force them into the background, in favor of the more abolitionist factions in Northwest and New England. In an article for <i>Die Presse</i>, published two days after his letter to Engels, he emphasized the point, ""New England and the Northwest, which have provided the main body of the army, are determined to force on the government a revolutionary kind of warfare and to inscribe the battle-slogan of 'Abolition of Slvaery!' on the star-spangled banner."" He cites acts like the Homestead Bill, the admission of West Virginia, and the new law permitting the arming of emancipated slaves as evidence. This exchange reminds us that Marx was the more political thinker, at least with respect to the way war was not just a strategic but a socially transformative process driven by more than tactical considerations. </p>   <p>Other evidence of Marx's greater interest in the political than military dynamics of the war abound. A remarkable letter to Engels, dated July 5, 1861, contains an extensive analysis of Southern secession, in which he observes that nearly every state refused to put secession to a popular referendum because the slave oligarchy was afraid of resistance from the majority of poor whites. Given the common wisdom in our time that that popular sovereignty and referenda are the pivots on which racist societies, Marx's letter is a taut reminder that one of the most vicious attempts to protect the enslavement of a race had to employ the least democratic means available. </p>   <p>On the other end of the war, we find Marx and Engels, and their associate Weydemeyer, initially excited about Reconstruction as the truly revolutionary phase. Against the expectation one might have, they identify political conditions, specifically coercive guarantees of equal voting rights for Blacks, as the key to emancipation. The most interesting of these documents, translated by Zimmerman, is a 3 part series that Weydemeyer wrote for the German-language St. Louis paper <i>Westliche Post</i>. Weydemeyer argues that, short of full political equality for blacks <i>and</i> redistribution of land from former slaveowners to free blacks, emancipation will have failed. ""Despite years of occupation of southern territories, almost everywhere we have missed the opportunity to introduce free labor into southern life,"" Weydemeyer writes. Weydemeyer's point was that this was the only way to create the class basis for defending freedom for all. Freed blacks formed the only reliable group fully committed to Reconstruction, since the ""southern landed aristocracy"" was committed to restoration, the 'poor [rural] whites' too corrupted by their association with the old regime, leaving only the ""much despised Negroes, who, along with the white craftsmen of the cities, represent practically the only workers in the South."" Notably, Weydemeyer put greater emphasis than Marx or Engels, on the dangers that poor whites posed to emancipation, perhaps because he was in the United States and had a better feel for the racial dynamics. This is but one more reminder of not just the intrinsic fascination but also the contemporary relevance of Zimmerman's wonderfully edited volume. There is ten times more material worthy of discussion than I have been able to mention here.</p>  <p><i>Alexander Gourevitch is an assistant professor of Political Science at Brown University.</i></p>"	Gourevitch, Alex	Winter 2017	2017-2-1	Review			International Publishers		Politics			"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=242 alt=\""Product Cover\"" border=0 src=\""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/zimmermancwinusf.jpg\"">"							
6519	9780813228822	$29.95	The Civil War Diary of Father James Sheeran:  Confederate Chaplain and Redemptorist		Sheeran, James	Ed. Hayes, Patrick		"Redemptorist Revived: The Religious and Military Life of Father James Sheeran <p>In a splendidly edited work, Patrick Hayes has brought together the full diary of Father Sheeran, hitherto available only in an extracted form.  The present volume, the result of collaboration by Hayes and several of his Redemptorist brethren, not only records in great detail the observations of a chaplain assigned to the 14th Louisiana Infantry which served in the Army of Northern Virginia, it also offers key insights into the divided religious landscape of Civil War America.  Sheeran's observations begin with the Battle of Cedar Mountain in August 1862 and continue through the end of the Civil War, following Sheeran's release from imprisonment at Fort McHenry. Because the journal itself consists of both diary entries alongside of later elaboration, Sheeran's consistent agenda comes through.  He is at once thoroughgoing in his Confederate loyalties, devoted to his Catholic faith and ministerial office, and an apologist for the ecclesiastical and theological stances of his church, which invited so much scrutiny and criticism from Protestants. </p> <p>Although consistently maintaining in word and deed his ultimate devotion to the Church and to God, Sheeran was diehard Confederate.  He refused to be labeled a Rebel, preferring the term Confederate, and in the odd voice that characterizes his narration of conversations, consistently defended the states as the creators of the Union, the absolute right of secession, and the rectitude of the Confederate cause.  He simply avoids discussing the institution of slavery, but his use of ""niggers"" and ""darkies,"" along with stories he tells of his interactions with African Americans, indicates his cultural white supremacy.  His denunciations of Abolitionists add to the case that he saw nothing contrary to Christianity in the institution of slavery.  And of course, Sheeran had no use for Abraham Lincoln.</p> <p>Throughout the diary, Sheeran contends with Protestantism in general and provides an incomplete but informative image of his relationship with the other chaplains in Lee's Army.  He politely refuses to join in the Chaplain's Organization that played a significant role in the storied series of revivals in the Army of Northern Virginia.  At the same time, he did preach to ecumenical assemblages, though the bulk of his ministerial efforts focused on Catholic troops.  He was especially critical of Protestant chaplains allegedly refusing to provide bedside support, especially nursing services, to wounded Confederates.  His commitment to his Catholic charges resulted in his arrest and imprisonment by General Sheridan, as he was attempting to provide ministerial aid to wounded soldiers in Winchester, who were now behind United States lines by late fall 1864.</p>   <p>As recent studies are elucidating, the Confederate chaplaincy's efforts to convert soldiers led to cooperation much more than theological ecumenism.  Given his Catholic faith, theological cooperation proved even harder for Sheeran.  Throughout the diary, he engages in apologetics, referring to Protestants as apostates and chastising Protestant chaplains for having little to offer to make the Good Death trope a reality.  Here he means the lack of a proper baptism, extreme unction, and prayers for the dead insure that the departed stand before God ""with their souls stained with original sin. . . . . O! Protestantism! How much thou has done to offend God, injure man and serve the evil one."" (23)  Fiercely devoted to his dogma, Sheeran simply believed that without conversion to Catholicism the Protestant majority that surrounded him were destined for hell.</p> <p>Yet, for all of what Hayes terms ""braggadocio and bloviation,"" the product of a controversialist nature and literary style that had earned him favorable reputation in the Catholic religious press before the war, Sheeran was much more than a parochial partisan. (2) Sheeran considered the Civil War as a sinful, wasteful enterprise, brought on by human cupidity.  He believed that the war's circumstances did not provide an excuse for military atrocities, drunkenness, profanity, or other moral lapses.  On more than one occasion, he urged his congregants during wartime mass to conduct themselves as missionaries for the true faith through their day-to-day moral living. And he relates at least two occasions where he confiscated a whiskey-laden canteen from imbibing soldiers.</p> <p>Sheeran's diary provides a spirited view of one person's observation of a massive conflict.  Read alongside of J. William Jones' wartime correspondence and his <i>Christ in the Camp</i>, Sheeran's wartime writings illustrate many parallel themes to those of the Chaplain of the Confederacy.  They rehearse and really are an initial draft at what would become the Lost Cause.  Confederate leaders were heroic, even Jefferson Davis. Lincoln (""King Abraham 1st, of infamous memory"") and his generals were brutal and abusive. (534)  Confederate soldiers fought with élan and only yielded against massively overwhelming odds.  Union soldiers were often cowardly and always course and vulgar.  Still, even the minister, Sheeran heard confessions, ""and aided in washing and dressing some"" of the wounded northerners who fell behind Confederate lines. (366).</p> <p>For all of its peculiarities, Sheeran's diary is a delight to read.  His prose is spirited, dramatic and vivid.  He describes the continuation of the Battle of the Wilderness:  ""The Moloch of the north had . . . not been satiated."" (384) He compared his determined nighttime battle against bedbugs to Hannibal's determined quest to redeem his father's honor in the Second Punic War.</p>  <p>The diary adds some insights into the religious ecology of a chaplain's work.  Regular religious devotions were typically suspended not only in the heat of battle but also when units were assigned picket duty.   He offers contemporaneous descriptions of the impact of war on the home front from high prices to scarcity of food. But some of the passages are incredulous, reading more like what Sheeran wanted to believe that what actually may have happened.  Lengthy passages of exchanges with Generals Lee and Sheridan seems to say more about Sheeran's desire to have his ministerial office respected that what one would actually have said to a general officer.  Because Sheeran was imprisoned during the last winter and spring of the war, he could make no observation on the morale of the Army of Northern Virginia, especially as the noose around Petersburg grew ever tighter. In sum, this large diary is well worth the time required to wade through its text, it offers insights into the presence and perspectives of Confederate Catholics, and augments the historiographical understanding of the contours of Confederate devotion to its cause for independence.</p><p><i>Edward R.

6352	9781477308462	$29.95	Another Year Finds Me in Texas: The Civil War Diary of Lucy Pier Stevens		Stevens, Lucy Pier	Tongate, Vicki Adams		"Reflections in Isolation: Lucy Pier Steven's Texas Diaries<p>In <i>Another Year Finds Me in Texas</i>, Vicki Adams Tongate brings to light a remarkable diary illuminating home-front life in Civil War Texas.  The diarist, Lucy Pier Stevens, was a young woman from Ohio who became stranded while visiting family in Texas at the outbreak of the war.  Lucy found herself a guest for more than five years in the home of her socially prominent uncle and aunt, James Bradford Pier and Lu Merry Pier, in the town of Travis.  Her observations on life in this still-developing region, the comings and goings of the local boys serving in the Confederate army, and social life on a Southern farm worked by slaves offer a rare perspective that is both insightful and enigmatic. </p><p>The book begins with an 81-page introduction that provides valuable background for Lucy's story.  Tongate places Lucy's experience in the Pier household within the context of the ""cult of true womanhood,"" the theoretical framework of expectations for middle-class women in mid-19th-century America expounded most famously by historian Barbara Welter.  As Tongate points out, this framework tended to breakdown in areas outside of the Northeast, but it is clear that Lucy carried with her the virtues of modesty, piety, and submissiveness, and made herself useful during her unexpected exile. </p>   <p>Lucy's diary covers only the years 1863 to 1865; Tongate explains that her 1861 diary was discovered only recently, and was not kept as faithfully as the later diaries.  Thus, we can sense little of the anguish Lucy must have felt when it first became clear that she could not return home.  By 1863, however, she had (in Tongate's words) ""put on a cloak of Southernness"" (p. 65) and adapted to her circumstances -- though never abandoning her hopes of returning home.  Her diary entries include reports of battles in Louisiana, where most of the local boys served.  Clearly she wished them well, but her opinions on the war are harder to decipher.  She often repeated rumors or comments, some disparaging Northern leaders, but never clearly expressed her own opinions about the conflict.  Although there is no indication that she felt a need to be discreet about her opinions, she had as an example of indiscretion the case of Dr. Richard Peebles, a local acquaintance who was arrested and exiled to Mexico for distributing pro-Union tracts. </p><p>The reader senses that Tongate, a long-time lecturer in the English Department at Southern Methodist University, is not entirely comfortable writing about 19th-century American history, but she makes excellent use of secondary sources to put Lucy's experience in context.  Tongate notes on page 63 that Lucy's growing sense of isolation mirrored the growing isolation of Texas as the war progressed.  The Union's Mississippi River campaign and the Red River campaign of 1864 purposely cut Texas off from the rest of the Confederacy, leading to an ""almost total information breakdown.""  News of the outside world became infrequent and often faulty.  All Lucy knew was that not even a letter could find its way out of Texas by the end of 1861, nor did she receive any word from home until late in the war. </p><p>As the war drew to a close, Lucy grew more anxious to return to Ohio.  In mid-April, 1865 -- unaware of Lee's surrender at Appomattox -- she arranged passage on a blockade-runner out of Galveston and made her way to Havana, thence to New York.  It might still have been several weeks or months before she could travel safely overland, but her sudden decision to take a risky voyage of escape underscores a desperation that she gave only partial voice to in her diary.  Her account ends just before she was reunited with her family. </p><p>Tongate's treatment of Lucy Pier's diary is a work of exhaustive research and devoted scholarship.  She might have chosen to interpret the diary in other ways--for instance, by comparing it to those of other northern women stranded (or living voluntarily) in the South.  Nevertheless, the richness of Lucy's narrative, supplemented by Tongate's well-researched commentary, make this a delightful and informative read. </p>  <p><i>Another Year Finds Me in Texas</i> includes a useful timeline, a list of friends, family, and acquaintances mentioned in the diary, and photographs of family members. </p><p><i>Jeffrey D.

6340	9781469626222	$45.00	Bonds of Union: Religion, Race, and Politics in a Civil War Borderland		Ford, Bridget			"Religious Difference and the Making of Unionism before the Civil War <p>In <i>Bonds of Union: Religion, Race, and Politics in a Civil War Borderland</i>, Bridget Ford argues that Civil War-era Americans living in Ohio and Kentucky forged communal ties through urbanization that were strong enough to survive one another, secession, and war. In a somewhat odd bit of whipsaw analysis, Ford stresses the ironic tensions between Protestants and Catholics, blacks and whites, and nationalists and sectionalists as the social and cultural glue holding Kentuckians in Louisville and Ohioans in Cincinnati together during the crushing challenges of civil war. <i>Bonds of Union</i> demonstrates that urban Americans along the Ohio River shared a common language regarding race, devotional religion, and the importance of preserving the American Republic; which in turn strengthened their commitment to the Union war effort. Paradoxically, Ford believes that the same social strains that caused deep, bitter resentments in the years before the war gave Americans in these two river cities the language, capacity, and will to unite to save the Union. Bridget Ford's themes are often jarring when juxtaposed together, but she surprises readers on purpose to move a complex, nuanced argument forward. Well-researched and fairly clear, Ford's book is an interesting addition to the emerging field of border region studies in the Civil War Era. </p> 	<p>As Ford sees things, antebellum clashes between native-born Protestants and immigrant Catholics created a new devotional energy that strengthened attachment to the Union in the years before the Civil War. For instance, she argues that ""the arrival of thousands of European Catholics, especially from Germany, to the cities of the Ohio River valley in the 1840s and 1850s led to an entirely distinctive religious history, where immigrants and native-born Protestants both sought out 'bonds of union' among believers and with Christ through intense devotional zeal -- much of it imported by Catholic religious orders -- not seen elsewhere in the United States"" (xii). This development was important in Ford's view because in borrowing from one another's devotional playbook, both groups forged a common attachment to the Union that made their free pursuit of the heavenly kingdom possible. The role of the border region itself in forging these bonds is intriguing because Americans living here occupied a sort of liminal space were ideological purity was impossible, even for the most rabidly sectarian. </p> <p>Similarly, in perhaps the most innovative section of her book, Ford explores the way that race and racial concerns both exacerbated bigotry while also energizing anti-slavery sentiment along the border. In somewhat overwrought prose, but apt analysis, she rightly argues that in antebellum America ""the thorns of race hatred and the blooms of human equality grew together, as if mutually dependent, with sharp points violently protecting the fragile new growth of democracy among all white men, whether rich or poor"" (89).  Ford is certainly not the first scholar to argue that throughout the antebellum era black chattel slavery was a vital bulwark propping up American political and social equality; and until the Thirteenth Amendment abolishing slavery was ratified on December 6th, 1865 the federal constitution's claim to speak for ""We the People"" really meant ""We the People"" (who are white). </p> <p>Yet her claim that the border cities' context forced pro-slavery and anti-slavery Americans to see the human costs of one another's position is innovative and new. It will not shock readers to learn that race (and religious) riots exploded across Louisville and Cincinnati in the 1840s and 1850s, but they may be surprised to learn that a counter-weight to reactionary violence also emerged as well. Black and white preachers, polemicists, and social reformers challenged racial stereotypes in Louisville, Cincinnati, and the surrounding countryside through sermons, pamphlets, and moral essays and novels. Free black businessmen, clergy, and educators in both of these cities further undermined racial stereotypes by demonstrating the possibility of a sober, moderate, black bourgeoisie. Although white Kentuckians and Ohioans clung to colonization through almost the end of the Civil War as a desperate answer to the supposed impossibility of racial peace after freedom, many also embraced abolition as the last, best hope of preserving the Union. </p> <p>Finally, Ford also believes the geographic, political, and cultural context of the river cities themselves cast nationalism in stark relief to the scary specter of sectionalism. The advent of war brought its horrors to those on the border, who bore the costs of the wider nation's failure to compromise. Ford shows that relief efforts organized out of Cincinnati and Louisville forged strong ties that transcended section, race, and religion. ""Through these relationships,"" she stresses, ""civilian agents insisted they made war humane. Violence and civility, in their minds, fused a kind of transcendent union that ennobled rather than cast doubt on patriotism"" (275). This is notable because both the costs of fighting and caring for those injured or maimed welded Americans along the border together in simple, direct ways that they often struggled to comprehend and understand.  In similar fashion, newspaper partisans found a new faith in Unionism strengthened by the experience of war. </p> <p>Thus, although polemicists like Louisville's George Prentice often demagogued anti-Catholic and anti-black prejudice, while casting doubt on the probity and prudence of anything more than cold neutrality in regards to the sectional crisis in their newspapers before Confederates fired on Ft. Sumter, Prentice's Louisville Journal reflected a starker mood afterwards. ""In editorials, Prentice wrote of secession 'as a dead body [that] sinks in the sea,' and viewed neutrality as a 'quiescent' bodily state akin to a disabling paralysis. By contrast, Union loyalty he conceived, not surprisingly, as vital and pulsing with life"" (252). This is a crucial shift because it demonstrates the harder line that most Kentuckians would take to defend the Union if pushed, as they were once Braxton Bragg invaded the commonwealth in 1862. The context of the border itself again looms large in this development, as Kentuckians chose to defend the Union and helped doom the Confederacy in the process. </p> <p><i>Bonds of Union</i> has a few warts. The push-pull nature of Ford's analysis may prove jarring and disconcerting to some readers. She begins each of her sections with a chapter demonstrating all the ways Americans living in Louisville or Cincinnati disagreed on race, religion, or the cause of union. She then follows with further chapters exploring the ways the process of disagreeing forged new conceptual possibilities for Union and unionism. It is a sophisticated, subtle argument that mostly works, but there are moments where the analysis drifts towards near-contradiction. Further, this book would be strengthened by stressing the role of the border context more. To be fair, Ford is at her best when she shows how living together made people from different racial or religious backgrounds get along in ways that they did not overtly desire or completely comprehend. Yet she should stress this point even more forcefully than she already does in the text. Ford has the evidence to support this conclusion but does not always emphasize it enough. </p> <p>Those quibbles aside, Bridget Ford has written an interesting, innovative book. <i>Bonds of Union</i> is part of an emerging field of scholarship on the border region during the Civil War, and Ford should be commended for her intellectual agility and imaginative analysis. Readers will also find her prose usually clear and mercifully free of the jargon and tortured, pretentious verbiage that mars too many books in the field. Readers looking for context and understanding on how and why Kentucky and Ohio forged a commitment to the Union in the light of competing, contradictory contexts on the ground should read Ford's book. </p> <p><i>Joseph W.

6523	9780700624126	$34.95	Two Against Lincoln: Reverdy Johnson and Horatio Seymour, Champions of the Loyal Opposition		Harris, William C.			"Remembering the Loyal Opposition<p>How should historians treat those who were on the wrong side of history? How much attention should be paid to them? How should we evaluate historical figures who we might disagree with?<p>These are among the many important questions raised by William C. Harris's remarkably well-researched and elegantly written work of political history, <i>Two Against Lincoln: Reverdy Johnson and Horatio Seymour, Champions of the Loyal Opposition</i>.</p> <p>Harris, Professor Emeritus of History at North Carolina State University and a prolific author of the Civil War Era, focuses on two loyal Democrats (as opposed to Copperheads or anti-war Democrats)--one a senator from Maryland, the other the governor of New York--during the Civil War, who, as the ""loyal opposition"" (5), were opposed to emancipation and what they saw as the Republicans' threat to civil liberties, wanted ""immediate Southern restoration to the Union after the war"" (5), and who firmly opposed the Republicans' plans for Reconstruction.</p> 	 <p>***</p><p>Part One is entitled Reverdy Johnson: Conservative Unionist, and is in many ways a history of the Senate during the Civil War.</p> <p>In chapter one, Harris recounts the background of how Maryland's Johnson became one of the Nation's leading lawyers, and how he soon ""blamed the sectional crisis on antislavery agitation"" (10). Harris recounts Johnson's break with the Whigs over his support of the Mexican War; his role as Attorney General under the brief Taylor administration; his rise as a lawyer; his views on the <i>Dred Scott</i> case and the Kansas-Nebraska bill and other issues of the 1850s; and his attraction to the Democratic Party and his subsequent effort to unify the party. Johnson would shortly ""be at the center of the struggle to preserve the Union while defending civil liberties and constitutional rights against the federal government"" (29).</p> <p>In chapter two, we see the start of Johnson's clash with Lincoln over the president's suspension of the writ of habeas corpus; over the tension, as Harris notes, ""between 'treason' and the loyal opposition"" (34); and over the role that the anti-slavery movement should have in the conflict. By 1861, Johnson, who as a prominent politician from a border state (and soon to become a U.S. senator), Lincoln was eager to court, ""had become increasingly concerned by the government's resort to martial law to suppress dissension"" (43). Most of all, Johnson and Lincoln clashed over slavery, as Johnson did not want the Union's military to meddle with it. Harris discusses at length Johnson's dealings with General Butler and his legal efforts regarding the court marshal of General Fitz John Porter.</p> <p>In chapter three, we see the tensions with Lincoln escalate, as, among other issues, Johnson believed that ""the states had never really left the union "" only individuals in the South ... had rebelled"" (59). Harris also discusses Johnson's complex views on race and slavery. Johnson would openly defend several Northern generals, and even ""charged that President Lincoln himself was directly to blame for the battlefield failures"" (69). Above all, Johnson ""faulted both the anti-slavery militants in the North and the secessionist conspirators in the South for the delay in ending slavery"" (72). Johnson would come to avidly support McClellan's 1864 presidential campaign, severely attacking Lincoln in the process, going so far as to charge that Lincoln had shown ""utter unfitness for the presidency"" (80).</p> <p>In the fourth and final chapter of Part One, Harris examines Johnson's post-war career, where he defended Mary Surratt; continuously clashed with Sumner and the radicals; supported the Sherman, or Military Reconstruction bill; spoke out, using rather appalling language by today's standards, against universal suffrage (98); argued over how exactly the 14th and 15th Amendments should be interpreted; played a leading role in Andrew Johnson's impeachment trial; got involved in diplomatic relations with Great Britain; and clashed with Grant's tough approach to the Ku Klux Klan.</p> <p>***</p><p>Part Two is entitled Horatio Seymour: Democratic Party Leader.</p> <p>In chapter one, Harris briefly charts the rise of the future New York Governor before turning to his involvement with the fractured politics of the early 1860s, where he shared many of Reverdy Johnson's views, especially the blame he placed on the anti-slavery movement for the war. Seymour was an enormously powerful force; in the words of one Lincoln cabinet member, there was ""no man in the country better equipped for the presidency"" (123). Against his wishes, he was nominated for governor, an election he won, riding a Democratic wave in 1862. At the end of this section, Harris is especially critical of the way that Seymour distorted the positions of the abolitionists. </p> <p>Chapter two examines Seymour's many clashes with Lincoln in 1863. In Harris's judgment, ""Seymour missed the crucial point that the changing nature of the war and the animosities and divisions that it engendered, including the issue of emancipation, made "" a political outcome improbable. The war had to be won on the battlefield before a political settlement for the South could be obtained, or more realistically, imposed"" (140). Soon, Seymour becomes perhaps the leading Northern Democrat, and there was even talk that he was a Copperhead, a false charge, for, as Harris notes, ""Seymour Democrats wanted no peace short of reunion"" (146). Harris proceeds to analyze the Vallandigham affair, followed by a riveting section of the controversy over Seymour's remarks following the July New York City draft riots.</p> <p>In chapter three, ""Democrat Champion, 1864,"" Seymour ramps up his denunciations of Lincoln and of the future plans for Reconstruction, with the New York governor ""issuing an early warning against any federal political requirements on the postwar South"" (171). He charged the Lincoln administration with attacking a free press and civil liberties, and, as the North got more and more disillusioned with the war, Seymour's national profile rose. In the fall campaign, he ""charged that Lincoln had lost control of national affairs to the radical Republicans"" (181), among other outrageous attacks.</p> <p>Harris then astutely observes that ""The Civil War, rather than unifying the North and the border states politically, had contributed to a heightened climate of partisanship and even paranoia regarding the motives of the opposition"" (182).</p> <p>In the fourth and final chapter of Part Two, Harris examines Seymour's actions following Lincoln's assassination and during Reconstruction. His all-encompassing attacks on Republicans, often with ""typical hyperbole"" (191), only continued, centered often on the topic of race and states' rights. He even went so far as to call blacks ""an ignorant and degraded race"" (195). In dramatic fashion, he was soon the Democratic nominee for president in 1868, becoming, as one biographer noted, the only American, before or since, to get ""the nomination of a major party against his will"" (203). Harris's study concludes with the vicious 1868 campaign, where a mere ""switch of 30,000 votes in targeted states, though an unlikely event, would have won the presidency of the New York Democrat"" over Grant (207).</p> <p>Harris is overall quite critical of many of the positions of both men, yet in his conclusion argues that ""Despite the shrillness of their language, Johnson and Seymour pursued a conservative course between that of the Republicans and the Copperheads"" (216).</p> 	<p>***</p><p>The radical Republicans and their quest for racial justice, as well as, of course, Abraham Lincoln, are so much the heroes in the vast majority of today's books on the Civil War that one can forget that each had fervent critics and enemies. For admirers of the radical Republicans and Lincoln, this is a tough book to read, as vitriol upon vitriol rain down upon them both. But Harris's study reminds us how much frustration there was towards Lincoln, regarding both the slow rate of progress in winning the war, as well as the methods Lincoln used to help win the war.</p><p>The overt racism of Lincoln's opponents is especially difficult for today's reader to slog through. But one of the book's many strengths is the way Harris gently points out how utterly misleading many of these two men's statements were, as well as the restraint the author shows in not attacking their often absurd charges.</p> <p>The format is rather unusual, and I am not sure that it entirely works. The book might have read better had he woven together both men's political careers chronologically. One other way of doing this study would have been to have included several other critics of Lincoln, and to have centered the text on the themes that united them.</p> <p>Harris often strays from his main figures, and instead offers a straight-up history of the Civil War. Indeed, Johnson and Seymour often disappear from the text for several pages; for example, Seymour is absent during Harris's extensive discussion of the Vallandigham affair.</p> <p>Another problem is that the author often repeats topics in Part Two that had already been discussed in Part One, which distracts the reader.  Furthermore, in Part Two he frequently adds to a sentence about Northern Democrats and Conservatives that their positions were also shared by Reverdy Johnson.

6344	9780674055810	$29.95	The Lives of Frederick Douglass		Levine, Robert S.			"Rereading Frederick Douglass	<p>In <i>The Lives of Frederick Douglass</i>, Robert S. Levine studies Frederick Douglass's autobiographies written from the 1840s to the 1890s to provide a new perspective on Douglass. Looking at the rich body of work Douglass left us, especially but not exclusively Douglass's three autobiographies, Levine weighs the texts against one another. Through his critical analysis of what Levine describes as Douglass's autobiographical project, Levine looks to Douglass's evolving ideas of race, violence, and abolitionism and advances insights into Douglass as a writer and as a social reformer. </p><p>Levine focuses on Douglass's autobiographical texts, assessing the performative nature of self-writing. Douglass published three autobiographies, <i>Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass</i> in 1845, <i>My Bondage and My Freedom</i> in 1855, and finally, <i>Life and Times of Frederick Douglass</i> in 1881 (which he revised in 1892). Levine begins evaluating the reception and status of Douglass's three autobiographies from the time Douglass wrote them. While Douglass's fame was derived from his oratory in the nineteenth and early-twentieth century, Levine claims that by the late-twentieth century scholars referenced Douglass's 1845 <i>Narrative</i> as the mark of his genius, and the first autobiography has become the most cited and studied. However, in addition to the first, Levine reaffirms the importance of the second two autobiographies to Douglass and our reading of the man, and Levine reexamines Douglass's life by looking at each. Levine expands the number of texts to include the ""larger autobiographical project that encompasses a wide range of Douglass's writings"" too, incorporating into the collection of Douglass's autobiographies speeches, newspaper articles, and Douglass's 1853 novella, <i>The Heroic Slave</i> (4). </p> 	<p>Levine acknowledges that autobiographies reveal only glimpses into a life and that the writer carefully crafts the interpretations, so to evaluate the texts, Levine develops an approach that treats the works as performances. In particular, Levine recognizes that Douglass practiced self-examination and self-realization in writing and rewriting his story, making the autobiographies sources that cannot be reflexively read. Instead of shying away from the autobiographies because of their limitations though, Levine embraces the autobiographical texts, and he analyzes the arguments Douglass <i>chose</i> to deploy. Levine claims that Douglass continuously constructed his public self within the works, therefore allowing Levine to concentrate on the ""performative dimension"" of the autobiographical texts (28). Pondering the stories Douglass the writer told about Douglass the man, Levine rereads Douglass to present a new biography. </p><p>Levine skillfully employs this approach and contributes to the scholarship on Douglass's life with five chapters that focus on five moments in Douglass's life as lived in Douglass's writing. In the first chapter, Levine inspects the construction of the 1845 <i>Narrative</i> during Douglass's time with the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society, revealing the instrumental role the reform organization played in producing the work. Levine probes Douglass's expanding intellectual horizon in the second chapter, showing how Douglass reclaimed and recrafted the <i>Narrative</i> during his journey to Dublin. In the third chapter, Levine delves into Douglass's abolitionist philosophy, examining Douglass's fictional representation of the slave rebellion in <i>The Heroic Slave</i>. In chapter four, Levine looks at the well-trod topic of Douglass's relationship with Abraham Lincoln, and he contends that the Douglass-Lincoln relationship has been misunderstood, suggesting that Douglass embellished on his friendship with Lincoln to gain political capital (182). Levine closes the book surveying how Douglass spoke to and of Thomas Auld, who once claimed to own Douglass. Here Levine challenges prior Douglass biographies, speculating that in his later years ""Douglass remained uncertain about Auld's beneficence"" (282). </p> <p>Throughout the work, Levine presents compelling arguments, and one of the most important contributions he makes is in pointing out the significance of Douglass's novella, <i>The Heroic Slave</i>. <i>The Heroic Slave</i> is a novella about Madison Washington and the slave rebellion he led aboard the slave ship <i>Creole</i> in 1841. Pivoting from reflections by Robert Stepto and William McFeely on <i>The Heroic Slave</i>, Levine reconsiders Douglass's representation of the rebellion's leader. In McFeely's biography of Douglass, McFeely called <i>The Heroic Slave</i>, Levine quotes, a ""fantasy of his own heroism,"" but rather than treat Douglass's affinity for Washington as mere voyeurism, Levine argues that Douglass identified with Washington (147). In the process of crafting Washington the character, Douglass continued to think about his own rebellion and grappled with his place in the abolitionist movement. Levine demonstrates that as a result Douglass moved toward a different interpretation of his own rebellion and recognized violence as a potential means of ending slavery. Douglass's ""imaginative investment"" in the <i>Creole</i> rebellion, Levine writes, ""helps Douglass tell his own autobiographical story about his turn to a militant antislavery politics grounded in black solidarity and community"" (157). With this intervention, Levine reveals writing as an essential instigator of Douglass's shifting views, supporting Levine's assertion that Douglass held a deep ""faith in writing"" as a means of political action and as a method of forging identity (306). </p><p>Throughout Levine's work, as in the case of <i>The Heroic Slave</i>, Levine fruitfully rereads Douglass's autobiographies. By reexamining Douglass's self-writing attentive to the performative dimension of narrative construction, Levine offers valuable comparisons of moments in Douglass's life, highlighting problems in the historical record and supplying new conclusions, as well as new questions, about Douglass's life. In all, Levine's <i>The Lives of Frederick Douglass</i> provides a detailed look at the choices Douglass made when he sat down to write, yielding a clearer picture of the man as a writer and reformer while also evoking questions that invite further scholarship on Douglass. Levine's book will interest those seeking to understand the intellectual life of Douglass and more fully appreciate Douglass's political acumen. </p><p><i>Jonathan Lande is a PhD candidate at Brown University working on ""Disciplining Freedom: Union Army Slave Rebels and Emancipation in the Civil War Courts-Martial,"" which offers a new interpretation of the history of black Union soldiers.

6357	9780674088221	$35.00	Aiming for Pensacola: Fugitive Slaves on the Atlantic and Southern Frontiers		Clavin, Matthew J.			"Resistance and Interracialism on the Southern Frontier<p>Matthew Clavin's <i>Aiming for Pensacola</i> fills an important fissure in the literature about slave resistance in the Deep South. Clavin argues that despite the fact that slavery was entrenched in the culture of the Deep South, enslaved African Americans actively resisted the regime that held them captive and the white supremacist ideology which undergirded the institution. Clavin's work provides a strong counter narrative to the dominance of the Underground Railroad as the primary avenue for fugitive slaves attempting to secure freedom during the antebellum era. Pensacola was an important destination for runaways because of the seaport's reputation as an enclave for harboring refugees. As a culturally diverse Atlantic port, Pensacola's numerous commercial industries and public works projects employed large numbers of free and captive African men and women. Clavin mines court records, correspondences, personal memoirs and particularly underutilized runaway slave advertisements to excavate from the slavery archive detailed biographical portraits of fugitives. For example, from 1821 to 1861, Clavin recovered evidence of over 300 fugitive bondspeople who escaped in the vicinity of Pensacola. While the runaway slave advertisements illustrate one of the resources available to slaveholders to recover fugitives, it is also Clavin's most important evidence of Pensacola's multiethnic population that aided and harbored fugitives and more broadly the long tradition of slave flight and maroonage on the Southern frontier. </p><p>Clavin's earlier work on the influence of the Haitian Revolution on US slavery and abolitionism provided the author a solid foundation for exploring the ways in which bondspeople pursued freedom on the Southern frontier. As a work situating slave resistance in the Deep South within the Black Atlantic world, Clavin successfully escapes the limiting confines of the nation by navigating and positioning the contours of West African ethnic and cultural heritages at the forefront of his narrative. Pensacola was a marginal port on the edge of South, but Clavin argues that the comparatively limited commercial activities did not diminish Pensacola's relationship with larger political currents of the Atlantic world. In contrast to bustling international hubs like Charleston or New Orleans that flourished throughout the early nineteenth century, Pensacola remained relatively isolated and as a result posed many challenges to establishing a large-scale plantation complex. Sailors, dockworkers, soldiers and enslaved artisans formed the core of the port's multiethnic laboring class. Within this community, interracial cooperation was common. Refugees tapped into that resource upon arriving in Pensacola which contributed to the tradition of slave resistance in the region. By focusing on a small seaport on the edge of the Atlantic world, Clavin contests long-standing notions of quintessential Southern landscapes. </p><p>Florida was for much of its history a contested space where political instability provided captive Africans with a place to seek new lives outside of bondage. Established in 1738, Fort Mose, located north of Saint Augustine, was the first free-black settlement in the US. In the aftermath of the tumultuous War of 1812, Pensacola's slave population relocated to the Negro Fort outside the city. At the fort and at Prospect Bluff, captive Africans formed maroon communities. Marronage increased dramatically in the 1810s as many runaways found refuge with the indigenous population. On the southern frontier, Clavin argues that Native Americans and runaway slaves formed a short-lived political alliance against a common enemy -- US imperialism and the entrenchment of the plantation regime across the Deep South. Clavin show's how General Jackson's destruction of the Negro Fort destroyed any future large-scale frontier alliances between people who challenged US hegemony and rapidly accelerated Pensacola's integration into the region's plantation economy. </p>  <p>The port of Pensacola gradually assimilated into the white vision of the Deep South during the decades before the Civil War. Slavery and a rigid racial hierarchy was codified by the ruling white elites that governed the city. However, Clavin shows that because of Pensacola's geographical isolation on the edge of the Atlantic world, the port remained an important destination for runaways and refugees that challenged the institution of slavery. Pensacola's maritime industry and industrialized laboring class provided distinct opportunities for captive Africans to challenge their bondage and seek out freedom. Captive African Americans worked as skilled laborers, carpenters, artisans, bricklayers and blacksmiths in Pensacola's expanding urban economy. The owners of Arcadia Manufacturing Company, a water-powered cotton mill, employed over one hundred captive Africans and drew laborers from as far away as the Chesapeake. Pensacola entrepreneurs experimented with various forms of bonded and free labor. Consequently, captive Africans challenged dominate servile ideologies by proving they were as reliable and capable laborers as their white counterparts. Clavin brings to light the ways in which Pensacola was a proving ground for innovative labor strategies that challenged the foundation of Southern slavery and its eventual demise. </p>  <p>Pensacola's long tradition of marronage and slave flight continued to serve as a haven for refugees during the Civil War. Captive African Americans from neighboring states headed for Pensacola to take up arms and commence the full-scale assault on the institution of slavery. Those who congregated in Pensacola comprised a diverse array of Southern society. Some were radical abolitionists. Others were less committed to freeing the four million slaves in bondage across the South. Regardless of their status or commitment to ending slavery, runaway slaves continued to find allies in Pensacola who supported their bid for freedom as the Civil War raged. Hostility towards slavery was not limited to the bonded men and women of the Deep South. Poor white sailors and farmers took up arms and joined with their black neighbors to combat the Confederacy. The tradition of interracial resistance was tightly interwoven into the fabric of Pensacola's multiethnic culture. </p>  <p>In early 1861, Pensacola's Naval Yard and neighboring fortifications fell to the Confederacy. However, Fort Pickens, guarding the entrance to Pensacola, remained the only possession of the Unites States for the duration of the war in Florida. Consequently, as the Civil War raged, Fort Pickens became a beacon for captive Africans across the Southern frontier to escape towards. Many of the refugees enlisted in the service of the US Army and fought valiantly against the Confederacy. In Pensacola, Clavin argues that black and white soldiers united in an ""interracial band of brothers"" committed to the eradication of the Confederacy (p. 163). Throughout the Civil War, enslaved people and the Federal troops stationed in Pensacola collaborated in the pursuit of two intertwined goals; emancipation and the destruction of slavery. </p>  <p>Clavin deserves accolades for positioning a seaport located on the Southern frontier and on the edge of the Atlantic world within larger debates on US slavery and the role enslaved African Americans played in shaping outcomes and the nation's institutions. In line with much recent work on Atlantic seaports, by the likes of Alejandro de la Fuente, Matt D. Childs, Christopher Schmidt-Nowara and Michael D. Thompson, Clavin's work exposes Atlantic seaports as vital in the construction of slave systems and the resistance slave's provided in determining the construction of those vile regimes. By arguing for the role poor whites had in aiding and abetting fugitives in Pensacola, Clavin makes an implicit argument for the class struggle that played out in the years leading up to the Civil War. At times Clavin tends to flatten the complexities of interracial relationships and the inherent racial tension in forming multiethnic coalitions. Too often, Clavin misses opportunities to explain the strategies enslaved African Americans utilized in negotiating the power and violence that underpinned the Deep South's racially stratified regime. However, this quibble does not detract from his larger, well-articulated and well-documented thesis on Pensacola as a haven for fugitive slaves and beacon of freedom in the Deep South. </p>  <p><i>Neal D.

6574	252082249	$24.93	The Loyal West: Civil War and Reunion in Middle America		Stanley, Matthew E.			"Restoring the Nation and Reconciling the Past<p>This book engages a substantial body of scholarship that has emerged in the last quarter century investigating the vexed question of post-Civil War sectional reconciliation. As such, it navigates the currents of scholarly contention presenting this development in far less idealized terms than understood as late as the mid-twentieth century -- indeed, as a reconstitution of the nation achieved only with damaging moral compromises and long-term ill effects. Examining the last three decades of the nineteenth century, much of this work gauges collective cultural memory and historical commemoration. Prominently helping to set the current parameters of debate is David W. Blight's <i>Race and Reunion</i> (2001), in which he argues that the national commitment to sectional reconciliation in the late nineteenth century, ultimately, drew on racist impulses at work in both the South and North. No less influential is Caroline E. Janney's <i>Remembering the Civil War</i> (2013), in which she distinguishes ""reunion"" from ""reconciliation"" and argues that the latter notion was commonly objectionable to African Americans, who refused to forsake their belief that the Civil War was fundamentally about Emancipation and black equality -- and to white southerners, who persisted in advocating the justness of the ""Lost Cause.""</p> <p>Stanley breaks new ground by maintaining that historians such as Blight and Janney, among numerous others, have largely neglected the vitality, variety, and significance of Unionist memory and reunion within discreet regions of the United States. And, as a corrective, he offers a study that deals mostly with the southern halves of Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio -- an Ohio River Valley expanse settled initially by upland southerners that he denominates the ""Loyal West"" and, alternatively, the ""Lower Middle West."" Here, Union war veterans who organized into chapters of the Grand Army of the Republic -- as well as politicians, newspaper publishers, local historians, and civic groups -- drew on antebellum conceptions of an independent West that included both slaveholding and free states and nurtured deep suspicions of eastern bankers, industrial capitalists, and radical reform agendas. After Fort Sumter, loyal westerners, unlike their counterparts in Kentucky and Missouri, formed a distinctive understanding of the purpose of the Civil War and its enduring significance. The ""conservative consciousness"" that pervaded the region manifested as a condemnation of southern planters, a commitment to free labor, and a war only to save the Union. This same conservative orientation, of which white supremacy was an integral part, produced an equally vigorous rejection of Radical Reconstruction measures beneficial to the freed people and, ultimately, a calibrated embrace of sectional reunion that led the way to the broader rapprochement of North and South. By 1900, however, congressional leaders, northern capitalists, and advocates for a more industrialized ""New South,"" along with other makers of popular knowledge, had pushed this relatively unique western development to the edges of national memory to facilitate the widespread acceptance of a seemingly more wholesome ""binary"" North-South narrative of reconciliation comporting with post Spanish-American War nationalism.</p><p>The argument that whiteness and western identity were central to Civil War remembrance among loyal middle westerners and to white political reunion in their region certainly distinguishes <i>The Loyal West</i> from other reconciliation studies. Blight argues, after all, that white northerners abandoned the emancipationist legacy of the war as the price for reconciling with former Confederates. By the same token, Stanley's Union veterans were not generally predisposed to commemorate harmonious relations between black and white veterans. He questions the conclusion Chandra Manning makes in <i>What This Cruel War Was Over</i>  (2007) that most Union soldiers embraced the idea that the war was both about saving the Union and emancipating the enslaved. He also challenges the argument made by Brian M. Jordan in <i>Marching Home</i> (2014) that Union veterans resented the return of white Democrat party dominance in the South because this resurgence sabotaged a prime accomplishment of the war. In Stanley's words, ""Lower Middle Western veterans saw restoration, rather than emancipation, racial integration, or black civil rights, as the war's true legacy because the preservation of the Union had been their overriding war aim."" (p. 176)</p><p>Chapters six and seven, which deal primarily with commemoration and reunion, provide the most intriguing reading and interpretive innovations. As is the case with other chapters, analytical narrative here is rooted deeply in primary sources, which range from manuscript diaries and journals, transcripts of Decoration Day speeches, to political editorials. The voices of loyal westerners come out loud and clear. Stanley provides persuasive discussions of how the longstanding illiberal ideologies uniting the loyal Middle West ultimately translated into rising anxieties about incipient black equality, farmer and labor radicalism, massive immigration from Europe, and the myriad encroachments of urban modernity. All these developments, he shows, helped to spur lower middle-westerners, veterans and civilians alike, to seek reunion -- and first with former Confederate westerners south of the Ohio River. One does, however, come away from these chapters wishing to know more about the relationship of the conservative anti-reformism of Lower Middle West Union Army veterans and the work of the Women's Christian Temperance Union and woman suffrage activists in the larger cities of the region, especially Columbus and Cincinnati, Ohio -- and the role of Lower Middle West women, church-going, middle-class, and otherwise, in shaping the commemorative ethos and reunion politics of the region.</p> <p><i>The Loyal West</i>, overall, constitutes an excellent addition to the growing canon of sectional reconciliation studies. Stanley raises important questions about the cultural, political, and institutional sources of not only sectional reunion but also about the complex processes by which ordinary citizens, partisans, and elites in all regions of the United States jockeyed for position to produce a national identity at a critical juncture in its development. Stanley deserves praise for thoughtfully-rendered findings, indicative of a scholar who is deeply engaged with and excited about his work. Well suited for undergraduate instruction and the graduate seminar room, the <i>The Loyal West</i> will also be of interest to professional historians and lay readers interested in the history of the Civil War and its commemoration, and of Reconstruction, the Gilded Age, and New South.</p><p><i>Mark M.

Wood: A Biography of the Union General in the Civil War</i>. In <i>Wolford's Cavalry: The Colonel, the War in the West, and the Emancipation Question in Kentucky</i>, Lee writes on the career, as a soldier, of Colonel Wolford in the context of a political ideology that split Kentuckians during the war.  He framed the U.S. Civil War around a character having proved to be controversial for the Union political community, and the unit he commanded. Colonel Frank Wolford was pivotal about the question of emancipation and the service of African American troops in a state that sat on the border between north and south. The work does not excuse what Wolford felt about slavery, but it does put into perspective that soldiers in command could have had internal struggles with the political nature of the U.S. Government.</p> <p><i>Wolford's Cavalry</i> is for any avid Civil War Historian who has some interest in officers' positions on President Lincoln during the war, or a general interest in Kentucky military units. Readers need be aware that Wolford was critical of Lincoln and his stance toward the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation. Lee's inclusion of the General's images he identifies in work was useful, but there is a lack of maps to assist in geographic representation when referencing operations. Beginning with a brief examination of Wolford's familial heritage, Lee wastes no time by getting to the Mexican War and the 2nd Kentucky Volunteer Cavalry, where Wolford set a precedent for service and then his between-war career of practicing law. Moving in sequence with the U.S. Civil War, Lee attempts to balance the perceived image of Colonel Wolford by highlighting his tenacity as a military officer in combat and the 1st Kentucky Volunteer Cavalry throughout the western theater. References made to his unusual methods of drilling during camp and action in operations and battle depict an unconventional wisdom that Wolford brought as a leader within Union ranks. The operations he was responsible for leading proved that he was courageous and cunning. He was wounded fighting Morgan's Raiders, and would later depart as result of complications of that injury. (247) Lee devotes time to Wolford's 1st Kentucky Volunteer Cavalry throughout much of the work labeling chapters like Mill Springs, Soldiering in Tennessee, and Perryville.</p>  <p>The gallantry of Colonel Wolford, as Lee builds on throughout the first half of this book, would become oblivious to the public eye by a three-hour speech he gave to a general audience on March 10th 1864. In a three-hour rant, Wolford emblazoned an open crowd with his denouncing of Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation and the use of African American troops. Lee pinpoints that Wolford's main grievance was the overreach of executive power by Lincoln in, what he felt, was a state matter.(174) Some military commanders overlooked the public cry of a military officer, who supported the notion not to enlist African American troops, because of his service record. Lee describes an astonishing point that one citizen wrote Lincoln personally advising that Colonel Wolford, who was loyal to the Union mission, be removed to another state to ensure that loyalty. The move would not occur due to General Schofield having him arrested as result of the speech and only to await a court-martial. However, Wolford dishonorably discharged instead of being court-martialled, was arrested on multiple occasions, and on one of those occasions he was transported to Washington D.C. to meet with President Lincoln.</p>   <p>While Wolford was in Washington D.C., he met with President Lincoln on many occasions. Lee specifically mentions that the details of these encounters are unknown. Lee uses the one well documented encounter between Wolford and Lincoln, where the President President explained his reasoning for the Emancipation Proclamation, as a way to highlight Wolford's simultaneous loyalty to the Union and hostility toward emancipation.(183) Wolford, nearly being labeled a Confederate because of his harsh voice of criticism towards Abraham Lincoln, returned to Kentucky and supported General George McClellan's bid for the Democratic platform to the executive in 1864. Moving into the late war, Lee usefully juxtaposes the war of words between Wolford and Lincoln with Wolford's previous command. Wolford's old command of the 1st Kentucky Volunteer Cavalry would carry on without Wolford in the Atlanta Campaign and eventually muster out of service in December of 1864.</p>   <p>The war ended for members of the 1st Kentucky Volunteer Cavalry, and for Colonel Wolford. However, their service would always remain with them. Lee acknowledges some members went west in the post-war years, but many stayed in Kentucky. Furthermore, some of them became lawyers, judges, and several entered politics. For Wolford, a life of service led him to various public positions like the Kentucky House of Representatives and then to Kentucky's Adjutant General, and finally a role in Congress  in the 1880s. Wolford took his congressional positional seriously and adamantly supported veterans and their families. When serving as Congressman during the Grant Administration, Wolford did not accept the position of protecting businesses but instead protected those having been a party to some injustice. (243) The political life of Frank Wolford came to an end with his defeat and eventual retirement from the political sector. He would depart as a result of age and complications from a wound he received during the war.</p>   <p><i>Matt Meador is a professor of History at Belhaven University Memphis</i></p>"	Meador, Matt	Winter 2017	2017-2-1	Review			Potomac Books		Biographies;Military;Politics			"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=241 alt=\""Product Cover\"" border=0 src=\""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/leewolflordf.jpg\"">"							
6465	9780881465891	$29.00	Florida's Civil War: Terrible Sacrifices		Revels, Tracy J.			"Sacrifice at the Margins of the Confederacy: Florida and the Civil War<p>Of the tens of thousands of books published in the one hundred and fifty years since the American Civil War,  only a scant handful have covered the state of Florida and its people. Why this seeming lack of interest from scholars? Perhaps it is the absence of bloody titanic battles like Shiloh or Gettysburg, or the fact that the Florida peninsula and panhandle were on the outer edges of the Confederacy. This historical neglect is truly unfortunate as Florida's wartime experience is a microcosm of the greater Confederate South during the struggle. Since the 1990s, a few new Florida studies have appeared, and now Tracy J. Revels' <i>Florida's Civil War: Terrible Sacrifices</i> joins the literature in an effort to help fill this void in the state's historiography.</p><p>Revels lays out how near-wilderness Florida became the third state to leave the Union and opt to join the new Confederate States of America in January, 1861. The giddy joy of secession soon soured as the new national government in Richmond made the strategic decision to all but abandon the peninsula state to the mercy of Federal forces. Even in the face of this, rebel leaders still expected Florida to supply its war machine with manpower, economic support in the form of items like cattle and salt, and finally a base for successful blockade-running. Over time these demands, combined with shortages of basic consumer products and the real threat posed by the Union navy and army, eroded support for the war. By 1865 the political and social fault lines already existing in the state ruptured and sapped civilian morale. In the author's view these divisions, when laid bare, exposed Floridians black and white to the horrors of a true civil war.</p><p>Professor Revels states in her preface that she hoped her book would be ""a consideration of the social factors that shaped the state and its role within the Confederacy."" <i>Florida's Civil War</i> is indeed strongest when dealing with the plight of Florida's women who tried to make do on the home front in the face of serious challenges. She also looks at black Floridians free and unfree, Unionists, and finally lapsed Confederates who turned to desertion and draft evasion. The Seminoles of Florida receive some attention, but for some reason Floridians of Hispanic origin none at all. Despite this omission the spectrum of Florida society from Middle Florida planters to ""crackers"" living on the south pine prairie is documented in considerable detail.</p><p>The bulk of <i>Florida's Civil War</i> covers military and economic matters relative to the conflict. Most of Florida's small urban centers were occupied early in the war by Union land and sea forces, and fighting in the state consisted of raids and counter-raids for years. The largest Civil War battle in the state, the February, 1864 clash at Olustee, ended in a costly Federal debacle. In the end Tallahassee managed to be the only Confederate state capital east of the Mississippi not taken by the Yankee army. Revels also chronicles the regimental histories of Florida soldiers serving in both the Army of Tennessee and the Army of Northern Virginia. While small in number these soldiers gave a good account of themselves on many fields of battle and returned home with honor intact.</p><p>The main theme of <i>Florida's Civil War</i> is the idea of the ""terrible sacrifices"" made by the people of Florida from 1861 to 1865. While this was indeed a daunting time, did all Floridians suffer as much as other sections of the Confederacy? Revels herself states that they ""fared better as a whole than did the residents of the Shenandoah Valley or the citizens who stood between Sherman and the sea."" (p. 123). The citizens of Atlanta, Vicksburg, and Richmond would have definitely agreed with that statement. Florida people on the home front did not have to endure large scale Union military campaigns or face the very real possibility of starving as the war ground to its conclusion. In fact they entered the post-war era in much better shape than many areas of the devastated South.</p><p>A concern about this study is the quality and use of primary and secondary sources by the author. Inexplicably the <i>Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies</i> and <i>Navies</i> were apparently not consulted in the research for this Civil War study of Florida. Neither appear in the bibliography, though the Army <i>Official Records</i> are mentioned once in a footnote (Page 122, note 38). The secondary works cited are often very dated, and many important recent studies have been left out entirely. It is hard to imagine that Revels' interpretations would not have been enhanced by looking at such prominent Confederate-era scholars as Emory Thomas, Gary Gallagher, William C. Davis, or Anne Sarah Rubin. Consulting and citing them would make <i>Florida's Civil War</i> a considerably stronger study.</p><p>While the author leans heavily on the scholarship of others, <i>Florida's Civil War</i> is written in an entertaining style that will appeal to popular audiences and scholars looking for a useful introduction to the subject.

One such encounter happened in Baton Rouge, Louisiana in 1862. A Union sailor, William L. Park, picked up a journal belonging to a young schoolgirl named Celeste Repp and kept it for his own wartime diary. Hence two different worlds came together and are brought to light here in <i>Two Civil Wars: The Curious Shared Journal of a Baton Rouge Schoolgirl and a Union Sailor on the U.S.S. Essex</i>, edited by Katherine Bentley Jeffrey. </p><p>Teenager Celeste Repp began her journal in 1859 while a student at St. Mary's Academy in Baton Rouge. It is mostly composed of her French lessons, and correspondence with beloved Catholic priest and future Confederate army chaplain Father Darius Hubert. While the events of 1860 and 1861 are not mentioned by young Repp they would soon impact her world and that of her family and friends. The coming of the Civil War meant that Baton Rouge would soon become a military objective of both Union and Confederate forces in the campaign for control of the Mississippi River region. </p><p>Federal forces seized that Louisiana city in 1862, and by June had taken over St. Mary's Academy and converted it into a hospital for Union troops. Two tars from the <i>U.S.S. Essex</i> were patients there when visited by a shipmate, gunner William L. Park. Using the old Navy adage ""gear adrift"" Park claimed Miss Repp's journal and converted it into his own written account of his naval service. Here their connection ends, as Celeste Repp subsequently left Baton Rouge and ended her days as a Sisters of Mercy nun in Vicksburg in 1914. </p><p>Park, a recent Scottish immigrant and veteran of the Royal Navy, enlisted as a Union sailor in September 1861. His journal grew into a terse tale of the life of a gunboat crew member on the Mississippi and how operations appeared to those serving below the quarterdeck. Details of the hard life sailors led aboard are forthcoming from Park, as well as his interesting observations on the changing state of race relations as slavery melted away to be replaced by an imperfect emancipation both ashore and aboard ship. </p><p>The <i>U.S.S Essex</i>, Park's floating home, was a fighting ship that saw active service including Forts Henry and Donelson, Baton Rouge, the clash with the Confederate ram <i>Arkansas</i>, the siege of Port Hudson, and finally the ill-fated Red River campaign in 1864.  His entries list the dangers of death, dismemberment, and disease facing him and his fellow mariners, as well as cramped quarters and food low in quality and quantity. In the end Park survived and served out his three year enlistment and received an honorable discharge in September, 1864. He went on to build a civilian life and family, and died peacefully in 1909. </p><p>Editor Jeffrey does an adequate job in bringing the Repp-Park journal to life, but there are things in the Park section that could have been fleshed out with more specific annotations. Parks mentions names of Union commanders and events that could be better explained to the reader with some additional research. That said, <i>Two Civil Wars</i> is valuable and joins the still growing body of Civil War first-person accounts. It gives voices to two interesting nineteen-century Americans who never met but shared a tremendous experience. </p><p><i>Robert A.

It continues to be in many ways <i>the</i> American conversation. One shortcoming in the historiography of American race-based slavery, however, has been the dearth of more detailed examinations of slavery in geographic areas outside of the primary Confederate states.  Western Pennsylvania, for example, was involved in slavery well into the 1830s, and visitors to museums and libraries there can now see this more carefully documented.  But it is only recently that this has occurred, and it remains an ongoing inquiry (ex. visit the Heinz Museum in Pittsburgh).</p><p>In a similar way, there have been many accounts of the political violence in the border regions of Kansas and Missouri prior to and during the Civil War, but little scholarship in comparison on the topic of how slavery actually functioned and grew there.  Kristen Epps has attempted to address this shortcoming in her detailed treatment of slavery in the border region between Kansas and Missouri.  Although written primarily as history, Epps is very comfortable with interdisciplinary tools and attempts to balance the story with both micro and macro perspectives, often using the semantics of sociology and social science.  This includes analysis of ""contested spaces,"" considering the ""functions"" of slavery, and the formation of frontier and race-based identities.</p><p>The author draws on an impressive number of local, but pertinent sources, ranging from newspapers to letters and personal records.  Census data, as one might expect, is also important to the narrative.  Epps is able to weave together individual stories of families and small groups of slaves and place them within the much broader growing regional conflicts that many Civil War aficionados are quite familiar with in the broader Civil War narrative.  Whether it be Samuel and Jane Harper, who immigrated to Canada after being freed in John Brown's 1858 raid, or the often untold stories of ""conductors"" and ""stationmasters"" along the Underground Railroad, Epps commands details and specific examples to guide the reader inside the causes and effects of ""Bloody Kansas"" and the border warfare that would define the region for several decades.</p><p>Epps has a solid appreciation for the complexities of slavery, slave ownership, and the nature of the slave economy.  Although the slave markets in the Kansas-Missouri border region functioned quite differently in some ways from those in New Orleans, or Richmond, they none-the-less demonstrated again the economic power of slavery that, wedded with capitalism even on small and local scales, made the structure so difficult to destroy outside of a terrible war.</p><p>Epps also has sensitivity to singular agency and motive.  Although many details and emotions of individual actors cannot be recreated decades later, the author does not shy from appreciating what they may have been, based on the available empirical evidence and this is a worthy accomplishment -- forging a voice years later for those who were allowed no voice, or left no trace of it.</p><p>This is a well-written, well-researched work on a very specific and needed topic that adds significantly to the story of race-based slavery in America.  The scope, which includes the Civil War era, is inclusive, but the narrative is rich and remains focused.  The work is likely to stand the test of time and remain meaningful to related studies.</p><p><i>Jack Trammell is associate professor at Randolph-Macon College, and recent author of </i>The Richmond Slave Trade<i>, and </i>A Short History of Richmond.</p>"	Trammell, Jack	Winter 2018	2018-2-1	Review			University of Georgia Press		Slavery			"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=243 alt=\""Product Cover\"" border=0 src=\""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/slaveryperipheryepps.jpg\"">"							
6503	9781621902157	$26.00	Southern Progressivism: The Reconciliation of Progress and Tradition, 2nd Edition		Grantham, Dewey			"Southern Progressivism Revisited<p>When the University of Tennessee Press published Dewey Grantham's <i>Southern Progressivism</i> in 1983, scholars warmly welcomed it as the first thorough historical analysis of the subject. In the three decades since, little has changed. In his introduction to this reissue of <i>Southern Progressivism</i>, historian of the southern progressive era, William A. Link, concedes Grantham's work remains ""the most comprehensive narrative account of the subject."" But in the years since <i>Southern Progressivism</i> hit the shelves, historians have added nuance and texture to themes Grantham explored in his near-encyclopedic work. In fact, historians have come to doubt the existence of any coherent progressive movement, instead framing the era as one of a multiplicity of reform efforts. Therefore, this piece will straddle the line between review and historiography by referencing works from the intervening decades that have supported, undermined, or expanded on themes examined and claims made by Grantham.<sup>1</sup></p>	<p>Further, this review looks forward from <i>Southern Progressivism</i> in part because, in his introduction, Link looks backward as he traces Grantham's academic lineage to UNC's Fletcher Green, and offers a brief historiography of the subject. Link starts with his father, Arthur S. Link, and his seminal 1946 essay, ""The Progressive Movement in the South, 1870 - 1914,"" which first challenged the predominant view that there was no southern progressive movement. In his well-crafted and useful introduction, Link explains that Grantham's ""mid-level synthesis"" was an attempt to ""reconcile"" Arthur Link's ""optimistic"" portrayal of southern pro-gressives, and C. Vann Woodward's and Jack Temple Kirby's more ""sinister views of reformers."" <sup>2</sup> Grantham succeeds in this task as he shows southern progressives were ani-mated by a humanitarian impulse, but also economically motivated, and often paternalistic in their outlook. This even-handed treatment allows Grantham to highlight the ambiguity, ambiva-lence, and irony in southern progressive reform.</p>	<p><i>Southern Progressivism</i> is a book in three parts, the first of which lays out a pattern of political, social, and economic changes that paved the way for southern progressivism. Politically, a pruned and overwhelmingly white electorate, residual agrarian and populist factions, and politically active professional and economic interest groups combined to create a ""paradoxical strain of political democracy."" At the same time, a growing ""sense of social needs"" spread through the region, and economically, the ""idea of southern progress"" took hold. In turn, southerners elected ""programmatic governors,"" who reflected the Democratic Party's new ""reform posture.""<sup>3</sup> While they were often unable to solidify political coalitions to carry on their reform efforts, the die was cast.</p>	<p>The movement's somewhat paradoxical nature largely resulted from these changes, but more importantly from the reformers' determination to simultaneously preserve what they believed was the best of southern society while reforming its institutions. Grantham's progressives did not tilt at windmills; they did not set out to dismantle the South's entrenched social hierarchy or to subvert its calcified racial order. Rather, they were ""cultural traditionalists"" who endeavored to create a ""new and more harmonious social balance"" in the region, which they believed was necessary to bring about the economic advancement and material progress predicted by the New South's prophets. Southern progressives' cultural traditionalism, rural heritage, and shared ""'economically self-interested, ethically shaped middle-class attitude toward life'"" made their reforms rather moderate and mild. Still, Grantham stresses that, ""After all, the progressives were reformers.""<sup>4</sup> Their reforms, which Grantham discusses in the book's second and largest section, focused on three interrelated but distinct facets: social control and state regu-lation; social justice; and social efficiency.</p>	<p>Progressives' pursuit of social control and state regulation manifested itself in the prohibition crusade, antimonopoly campaigns, and race relations. It also led to a piecemeal prison reform movement that skittered across the south, as states established boards of charity and cor-rections, juvenile courts, and provided inmates with religious guidance and libraries. While states abandoned the much maligned, albeit profitable convict-lease system, their ""economically self interested"" attitude resulted in their continued exploitation of prison labor. This, Grantham shows, ""provided the ultimate support for the South's labor system,"" as states passed vagrancy laws, in turn helping shore up the labor supply in times of shortage. In 2008, Douglas A. Blackmon of the <i>Washington Post</i> carried Grantham's argument further in <i>Slavery by Another Name</i>, which exposed how African Americans, unduly incarcerated in tremendous numbers, were forced to join the ""'perpetual road-mending club,'""<sup>5</sup> and construct the New South's infrastructure thereby helping propel the region's economic advancement. Their labor, Blackmon shows, sometimes provided up to ten percent of some states' revenue well into the twentieth century, until when in 1951 a federal statute criminalized forced labor.</p>	<p>Another manifestation of southern progressives' desire for social control and state regulation was the prohibition crusade, which Grantham concludes ""may have been the most dy-namic and passionately supported 'reform' in the South"" and was ""remarkably versatile,"" as it appealed to broad swaths of southerners -- urban and rural, white and black. Though southern Protestantism was primarily concerned with personal morality and salvation, the prohibition crusade served as a ""bridge . . . between those who wanted to reform individuals, and those who wanted to reform society."" The prohibition movement therefore became a gateway to reform for many southern Protestants, because they came to see other social ills as moral issues. This, Grantham believes, is evidence that ""there was an active social gospel in the South,""<sup>6</sup> a point historians have long debated.</p>	<p>Although Grantham sees the middle class, evangelical Protestant church as the well-spring of the southern social gospel, Elizabeth Hays Turner discovered that, at least in Galveston, Texas, reformers were not exclusively or even primarily from evangelical churches. Rather, her 1997 book, <i>Women, Culture, and Community</i> shows that Presbyterian, Episcopal, Luther-an and Jewish women's shared elite social status united them behind reform efforts.</p>	<p>Still, in both Turner's and Grantham's analyses, women were the primary agents behind the South's progressive movement, especially in their compulsion toward social justice, the second facet of progressivism in Grantham's definition. Many southern women cut their reform teeth in the Women's Christian Temperance Union, which one southern progressive believed fostered in southern women ""'a sort of unself-conscious radicalism'"" that propelled them deeper into the reform movement, including women's suffrage. Still, Grantham shows that their ""cultural conservatism"" blunted their newfound radicalism, thereby leading white women to advocate for suffrage that was delimited by race, not by gender. In 1993, Marjorie Spruill Wheeler reinforced Grantham's assertion when she showed in her book, <i>New Women of the New South</i>, that white southern women's pursuit of voting rights was largely motivated by their desire to ensure white supremacy, which made them leery of the movement for a national constitutional amendment.</p>	<p>Spruill Wheeler's analysis also promotes Grantham's claim that white southern progressives often employed the specter of racial turmoil to pursue their reforms. Still, there were white southerners whose interest in social justice compelled them to earnestly seek a solution to the ""race problem."" But their belief in innate white supremacy meant their reforms were a timid, ""updated version of paternalism,"" that ultimately demanded ""black docility.""<sup>7</sup> Therefore, southern black progressives, especially middle class women, took matters into their own hands and formed voluntary organizations like their white counterparts and worked to strengthen black schools and churches, which were instruments of African American uplift.</p>	<p>Glenda Gilmore's transformative 1996 <i>Gender and Jim Crow</i> expanded on Grantham's analysis and further emphasized the reforming role of middle class black women. Though they were deprived the right to vote, southern black women created a proto-civil rights movement through their efforts to register black voters. What's more, they embraced their new role as client to the growing state government, and used their womanhood to agitate for reform in ways black men could not, further solidifying black women's role as leaders of racial uplift in the progressive-era South. Other historians' works, including Steven Hahn's 2003 <i>A Nation Under Our Feet</i>, Paul Ortiz's 2005 <i>Emancipation Betrayed</i> and Leslie Brown's 2008 <i>Upbuilding Black Durham</i>, point to the progressive era as a time of African American women's leadership in a nascent, if inchoate, civil rights movement.</p>	<p>The educational awakening that spread across the South was another facet of south-ern progressives' drive for social justice and ""touched more of the region's inhabitants"" than any other reform. Southerners doubled state education expenditures, lengthened school terms, passed compulsory attendance laws, reduced the region's illiteracy, and increased funding for institu-tions of higher learning. And while southern whites were the primary benefactors of this awakening, northern philanthropists helped fund black schools, though they channeled their largess to institutions that promoted ""practical training,"" which they claimed would ultimately make the African American ""a home-maker, a farmer, a mechanic, and a good citizen.""<sup>8</sup></p>	<p>Making southerners good farmers was an essential part of southern progressives' search for social efficiency, Grantham's third facet of southern progressivism, as were their good government efforts and municipal reforms. Business progressives saw municipalities as ""largely a business corporation,"" and as such, ""they should apply business methods to public service."" They did just that by creating the Galveston plan, in which five commissioners were each granted ad-ministrative and legislative powers over a specific aspect of the city's governance, and the city-manager plan, which added an administrative ""professional 'expert'"" to the Galveston plan.<sup>9</sup> These reforms streamlined municipal governments and reduced expenditures. But these savings overwhelmingly benefitted businesses, Grantham shows. In his 1990 work, <i>New Men, New Cities, New South</i>, Don Harrison Doyle similarly explained that progres-sive businessmen in New South cities pursued a common good and willingly sacrificed to achieve it, though they did so because they believed reforms would also be good for their bottom line.</p>	<p>Grantham looks beyond the cities to where rural middle-class reformers tried ""rehabil-itating the southern farmer"" by forming ""organized pressure groups""<sup>10</sup> that called for modern farming practices and adopted Populist visions of railroad regulation, cooperatives, and communal warehousing. At the same time, students and professors from both white and black southern colleges ventured into the far reaches of the South and preached the profitability of modern scientific farming practices. This effort, Grantham shows, was the most ironic and ambivalent of all, because in the end, progressives' agricultural reforms would diminish the yeo-man farmer and with him, his traditional values, which progressives sought to preserve.</p>	<p>Like Grantham, in his 2003 book, <i>Lessons in Progress</i>, Michael Dennis high-lighted the outward thrust of southern institutions of higher education by following the careers of four college and university presidents. These progressive educators kept their advances attuned to southern societal norms, especially in regards to race and gender. Still, they believed they were progressive in their support for parallel institutions for African Americans and women.</p>	<p>Reforms in the three areas of social control and state regulation, social justice, and social efficiency followed a chronological and organizational pattern. In the first decade of the Twentieth Century, progressives embraced ""'the politics of pluralistic interest groups'"" and pressured state governments to expand their regulatory capacity and extend social services. By 1910, many progressives promoted their reforms through ""Southwide"" campaigns. And when Woodrow Wilson won the presidency, southern reformers nationalized southern progressivism by joining extant nationwide organizations or adopting their methods and approaches in their region-wide campaigns. Further, with Wilson in the White House, and a resurgent southern Democratic coalition in congress, southern progressives appealed to the national government for help in their reform efforts. This means, in sum, southern progressivism was a campaign for ""positive govern-ment.""<sup>11</sup></p>	<p>Grantham explores the nationalization of southern reform in the book's third and final section, which highlights southern progressivism's ironic nature. While progressives rejoiced at Wilson's election, the Democratic party's conservative leaders dashed their hopes when they forced the president to dole out patronage positions to ""old-line Democrats.""<sup>12</sup> And when subsequent reform efforts stalled at the state level, progressives turned to Washington believing a resurgent southern Democratic congressional coalition would advance their agendas. Indeed, southern Democrats in congress supported regulatory efforts, like tariff and banking reform but blocked social justice reforms, like child labor legislation. These southern congressional Democrats wielded their newfound power and nationalized the region's racial order by, for in-stance, segregating the government's workers, and denying federal appointments to African Americans.</p>	<p>David W. Blight's 2001 <i>Race and Reunion</i> shows that similarly, a denial of African Americans' service in the nation's collective memory of the Civil War helped to reunite the North and South. Proponents of three structured memories of the Civil War and Reconstruc-tion struggled for dominance in turn of the century America -- that of the reconciliationists, white supremacists, and emancipationists. Ultimately, as northerners embraced southerners' white supremacist and reconciliationists' memories of slavery, the Civil War, and Reconstruction, the re-gions reunited, but, Blight explains, ""the races divided.""<sup>13</sup></p>	<p>This racial division was true during World War I, which enjoyed widespread support among a newly patriotic and nationalistic southern population, despite the protestations of a ""dissenting minority"" comprised of Bryanites who foresaw war profiteering and southern congress-men wary of a reorganized national military. Their support came at the expense of southern progressive reform. Once the war began, southern reformers turned their attention toward mobilizing for war and serving the soldier and his family. While black men and women believed their com-mitment to the war effort would provide an avenue toward equality, whites did not. In turn, in the interwar era, African Americans exhibited a new ""assertiveness"" as they protested their mal-treatment at the hands of whites and joined the NAACP at record rates.<sup>14</sup></p>	<p>Although some of the works mentioned above have challenged Grantham's claims, the literature on the subject does more to substantiate his portrayal of southern progressivism than to undermine it. Grantham's work has withstood the test of time and has yet to be challenged in its breadth and scope. On that note, the length and detai
 of this review reflect <i>Southern Progressivism</i>'s length and detail, which can be overpowering in certain sections, as Grantham gets into the weeds of southern reform. Reorganization would help to streamline the volume, as it is at times redundant; the same names, organizations, motives, means, and achievements arise in different sections. Still, as it stands, <i>Southern Progressivism</i> offers its readers an unparalleled and exhaustive investigation of southern reforms, which makes this volume an absolutely indispensable resource for southern historians, and justifies its reissue.</p><p><i>Jeffery H.

6624	9781594162763	$29.95	Southern Reconstruction		Leigh, Philip			"Southern Reconstruction<blockquote>Mr. Leigh has written several books, including <i>Lee's Lost Dispatch and Other Civil War Controversies</i>, and <i>Trading With the Enemy: The Covert Economy During the Civil War</i>. He holds a degree in engineering from Florida Institute of Technology and an MBA from Northwestern University.</blockquote>	<p>Philip Leigh contends that the economic plight of millions of poor white Southern farmers embraces the most significant thrust of the decades following the Civil War. The absence of attention to this crucial phenomenon resides with a generation of recent historians. Their focus on racial equality for ex-slaves as matters of political ideology and Southern loyalty to the Union has dominated the scholarship of Reconstruction history.</p> <p>Leigh intends to right that wrong. His method is to examine the desperate conditions of poverty among white farmers and to censure the motives and inspect the damage caused by ""Radical Republican"" policies both federal and local. In Leigh's ken the Radicals are once again the ""bad guys"" of Reconstruction. His definition of Reconstruction focuses on the period from 1865 to 1877, but stretches into the latter nineteenth century and indeed into the twentieth. This resurrection process, alas, is severely flawed.</p><p>The evidence relies entirely on secondary sources. For support for his opinions -- and for quotations of individual speakers, snatches of memoirs, newspaper reports and other primary statements, even easy to locate statutes -- Leigh relies on prominent historians. Even in the Introduction he notes Claude Bowers, Avery Craven, John Ezell, Matthew Josephson, William McFeely, Kenneth Stampp, Brooks Simpson, James Randall and David Donald (neither with middle initials) among numerous others. The bibliography also identifies some historical documents, cited from online collections. This practice is followed throughout the volume. One might also observe the omission of current significant works on Reconstruction. Three published in 2014 -- as Leigh was writing -- may serve as exemplars:  <i>The Wars of Reconstruction: The Brief, Violent History of America's Most Progressive Era</i> by Douglas R. Egerton; <i>After Lincoln: How the North Won the Civil War and Lost the Peace</i> by A. J. Langguth; <i>The Ordeal of the Reunion: A New History of Reconstruction</i> by Mark Wahlgren Summers. Leigh's book lacks a certain scholarly demeanor which Reconstruction historians have come to expect.</p> <p>There are, further, factual errors. Three may be noted. Leigh states that the First Reconstruction Act, establishing military rule in the South, was ""passed on the first day of the Fortieth Congress,"" thus May 4, 1867 -- the first day of Radical Republican rule. That Act, however, was enacted by the Thirty Ninth Congress on March 2, not March 4. Does it matter?</p>  <p>The Thirty Ninth was elected in the Fall of 1864, along with Abraham Lincoln, taking office on March 4, 1865.  Moderates held sway in the Thirty Ninth: Senator Lyman Trumbull of Illinois, a moderate who became a Liberal Republican in 1872, was the principal author of the Civil Rights Act of April, 1866, passed over President Andrew Johnson's veto -- the first override in American history. Congressman John Bingham of Ohio, Chair of the Joint Committee on Reconstruction, shepherded the 14th Amendment in 1866 and in June 1866 sent it to the states for ratification. The Thirty Ninth contained some Radicals but not the juggernaut of Radicals who came next. That all Republicans, moderates and Radical alike, were ready to employ military rule, speaks to the general Northern distrust regarding the defeated rebels.  It weakens Leigh's argument about the evils of Republican Radicalism.</p> <p>Leigh's brief coverage of the Liberal Republicans of 1872 portrays that movement as dedicated primarily to ending Reconstruction, ""to give each state to herself,"" as Liberal presidential nominee Horace Greeley proclaimed. But the Liberals were not only for Universal Amnesty, which Leigh notes, but rather for both Universal Amnesty and Universal Suffrage, strongly supporting voting rights for freedmen.  Regrettably Leigh omits comment about other Liberal ideals -- civil service reform, free trade, and no reelection for a corrupt President Grant. He might have profited from this reviewer's work on <i>Nation</i> founder, E. L. Godkin, on Springfield, Massachusetts, newspaperman Samuel Bowles, and certainly on Missouri Senator Carl Schurz. While the Liberals lost in a landslide to Grant, they remain the only third party in American history with enough political clout to impel one of the two major parties to nominate its candidate for President.</p>      <p>Regarding the Civil Rights Act of 1875, Leigh tells us that ""the act attempted to support social equality by outlawing racial school desegregation and discrimination in public accommodations""."" To be sure the majority Republicans, led in the House by Benjamin F. Butler of Massachusetts (who had indeed lost reelection in the 1874 midterms for supporting the Bill), debated the school clause to the very end. The House struck out the provision literally minutes before passage, fearing a veto by President Grant. The Senate concurred. The substance of the law Grant signed on March 1, 1875, declares in Section 1:</p> <p><blockquote>That all persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the accommodations, advantages, facilities, and privileges of inns, public conveyances on land or water, theaters, and other places of public amusement; subject only to the conditions and limitations established by law, and applicable alike to citizens of every race and color, regardless of any previous condition of servitude.</blockquote></p><p>Current research suggests that the President likely would have vetoed the bill had it contained the school clause. The Supreme Court, in the Civil Rights cases of 1883, makes no reference to school desegregation.</p> 	<p>Leigh's viewpoint that the Republicans were motivated solely by politics, rather than ideology, urges some adjustment. The GOP may have abandoned their pre-war/wartime doctrines of racial equality. They substituted a more conservative but nonetheless powerful doctrine -- labeled for convenience as Rights--For--Order.</p>  <p>Equal rights created stability in the social order. If the source of disorder in society was inequality, the remedy was equal civil rights. Inclusion into the governance system of the freed people meant enacting uniform free institutions in the South. Those institutions would establish over time a peaceful southern social order. Equal rights would prevent the risk of renewed sectional conflict, preclude any long-term military presence in the South, and reflect the values of democracy and equality. Equality before the law offered an orderly social environment. Rights-For-Order consistently governed the Civil Rights Act of 1866, the 14th and 15th Amendments, the pro-Northern civil governments (following military rule), and ultimately the Civil Rights Act of 1875. Equal civil rights would remove the dangers caused by continuous festering inequality and perhaps renewed military conflict. Indeed, when white Southerners ""redeemed"" their state governments from ""carpetbaggers,"" even before 1877, they did so by means of peaceful elections. The U.S. army did nothing to prevent the conversion from Republican to Democratic rule.</p> <p><i>Southern Reconstruction</i> contains several discerning substantial portraits of persons Leigh considers significant. These include President Andrew Johnson, ""Pitchfork"" Ben Tillman, and Booker T. Washington. Some may find his minimizing the differences in the ideas of Washington and those of W.E.B. DuBois somewhat unusual.  His attention to the current controversy concerning the removal of Confederate monuments is prescient.</p> <p>Calling, as Philip Leigh does, for a more balanced approach to Reconstruction era scholarship -- one that emphasizes economic, rather than racial issues -- is certainly an intriguing position. It cannot, however, alter the wartime and postwar emotions of the Republican policy makers in Congress. Eleven southern states seceded from the Union. They formed the Confederacy. They took up arms against the U. S.  Some 625,000 died in ""the War of the Rebellion,"" the official title of the war to maintain the Union -- the bloodiest war in the 19th century. The institution of slavery was abolished forever. Four and half million bondsmen became free persons. </p> <p>Economic factors may supplement issues of race.

6389	9780820349725	$29.95	Stepping Lively in Place: The Not-Married, Free Women of Civil-War-Era Natchez, Mississippi		Broussard, Joyce			"Spirited Single Women in Mid-Century Natchez<p>Good monographs are like specialty stores: their ""goods"" are deeply-researched specialized historical evidence that amplifies a subject and offers new information on a particular topic, the corollary of a unique piece of clothing that highlights an outfit. Such is the case with Joyce Linda Broussard's excellent <i>Stepping Lively in Place</i>. As the title indicates, this is a study of unmarried women in Natchez, the port city along the Mississippi mostly during the antebellum period. After a background chapter on the setting in Natchez, Broussard focuses in individual chapters on not-married, divorced, and widowed white women, dissecting the ways in which these single women survived in a traditional system that privileged white males and expected adult women to be dutiful wives. </p> <p>In subsequent chapters Broussard turns her attention to free black women and what she calls the disorderly, not-married white and black women of antebellum Natchez, that is those who had some contact with the criminal justice system. Two final chapters move from the ante-bellum period to cover single women during the Civil War and post-war period. Enslaved women who held no legal status before the war are not included until after their emancipation; some married women whose male relatives were killed in the war or die soon after are included in these last two chapters as women living without male authority in their households. </p>  <p>Broussard does not -- in fact could not -- offer Natchez as typical of southern cities and hence she does not extend her conclusions to other southern communities, though she does argue that they fit a pattern of single women, as neither typical nor aberrant due to their marital circumstances.  Broussard's sustaining motif of stepping lively suggests how these single women -- divorced, never-married, widowed and abandoned--operated in a white, male-dominated world, maneuvering in times of war and peace ""with amazing dexterity."" (P. 239) But as Broussard makes clear they were never activists in the sense of envisioning political changes for all women, much less organizing, as their sisters in the North increasingly did.  But they did <i>step out</i>, living in the shadows, moving on their own, stepping on the edge and during Reconstruction, stepping into the breach. </p>  <p>This book began as a dissertation but in its present form it has none of the characteristic deficiencies the academy associates with dissertations. The writing is lively and informative despite the staggering but useful number of statistics.  A case in point: while we assume that most adult women are married, 40% of the 1200 women living in Natchez in 1860 were single. In one of Broussard's central themes, they are not aberrations as we have been led to believe because of their absence from the historical literature. Broussard acknowledges a recent body of scholarship that focuses on spinsterhood, although she is correct that most of these studies concentrate on elite women. Her study does not, as we learn about single women who were prostitutes, criminals, and in one case simply ""foul-mouthed."" Broussard is careful to note comparative material but she might have spent more time developing the reasons for the differences in her findings from other similar studies. </p> <p>Broussard's conceptualization is discreet, persuasive and only occasionally redundant. The research on which Broussard bases her conclusions is exhaustive and should stand as a model for anyone doing women's history where the sources are often illusive. Indeed one of the contributions of this book is its use of every available source -- from court records to manuscript collections, from census records to the freedman's bureau materials, from statistics to mini-biographies. </p>  <p>At stake in <i>Stepping Lively</i> is the operative common law distinction separating feme soles with limited legal rights and married femmes couvertes, the latter without legal identity after their marriage. Broussard describes the prevailing southern ideology of white male mastery that established cultural values glorifying marriage and the subordination of married women as helpmates. She writes on page 6 that this system based on the ""servant ideal"" offered women ""a protected albeit second-class citizenship covered by the authority of paternalistic husbands who often viewed women as wards deserving of a white man's protection and care in return for faithful service and obedience."" The question Broussard seeks to answer in its most simplistic terms is how did single women in Natchez navigate such a system in the ante-bellum period and later during the Civil War's disruptions? As she writes in her introduction ""By looking at the entirety of single free women in midcentury Natchez,""this book explores how the city's single women ""from all walks of life coped, survived, and endured over time in a wealthy, slave-driven community ripped apart by war and its tumultuous aftermath."" (p. 9) </p><p>Throughout Broussard has humanized her statistical material by including profiles -- biographical mini-narratives of individual women. For example in the chapter on never-married white women Lydia Dowell, viewed as foul-mouthed by some of her neighbors, operated two successful shops in the city. The memorable widow Madame Gireaudeau lived comfortably in a well-appointed home with a retinue of enslaved, many of whom she emancipated. Only after her death did the community learn that she was the child of a mixed-race mother and in the racial calculus of the times, a free black, subject to various restrictions. Margaret Dent, a free black, earned her living as a washerwoman while she enjoyed a sexual relationship with a wealthy white planter and slaveholder who remembered her in his will. </p><p>War and its aftermath upended the cultural norms of this antebellum society, though they did not entirely displace male, white authority. Still women had new opportunities during the war and Reconstruction.  Broussard's chapter on these women during the Civil War is a stand-alone classic of a community at war. </p> <p>Overall this is an excellent example of how a look at a singular community adds to our  historical ""store"" of knowledge. </p> <p><i>Jean Harvey Baker is the Bennett-Hayward Professor of history at Goucher College.

6466	9781451671926	$28.00	The Quartermaster: Montgomery C. Meigs -- Lincoln's General--Master Builder of the Union Army		O'Harrow Jr., Robert			"Supplying Victory: Montgomery C. Meigs Revised<p>By the spring of 1861, the city of Washington was inundated with soldiers, but the Federal army was still trying to provide uniforms, equipment, food, and shelter in much the same way it had before President Lincoln called for volunteers. Providing for over three hundred thousand was not the same as providing for considerably less.</p><p>Luckily for the Union, William Seward, newly minted Secretary of State, knew a youngish captain of engineers -- Montgomery C. Meigs. Rather than put older officers like Winfield Scott and Joseph Totten in the field, Meigs seemed like a good bet. He had designed and implemented the Washington Aqueduct, and had taken control on a project to expand the capitol building, promising to create a space that would, "" . . .  resonate with the promise of America. ""</p><p>Offered the job of holding Fort Pickens, Captain Meigs quickly went about the business of designing a plan to reinforce the fort. The operation was successful, and Meigs gained the confidence of the president. By May of 1861, Lincoln had decided to make Meigs the quartermaster general of the Federal Army.</p><p>Robert O'Harrow's book, <i>The Quartermaster: Montgomery C. Meigs -- Lincoln's General -- Master Builder of the Union Army</i>, allows the reader a chance to become acquainted with Meigs and his massive accomplishments in a new biography that follows his subject from his early Army engineering career to becoming, as James McPherson calls him, ""the unsung hero of northern victory. "" O'Harrow, an award-winning author in the investigative unit of the Washington Post, approaches his subject in such a manner as to highlight Meigs' many accomplishments without ever waxing maudlin or poking fun at the sometimes-grumpy officer. O'Harrow's Meigs is strong, honest, cultured, forward thinking, and fiercely loyal to his country and the war effort.</p><p>Meig's efforts span the entire war and include supplying Meade's forces at Gettysburg, Grant's various supply needs -- from Vicksburg to Petersburg -- and Sherman's army in Georgia and on the march to the sea. Whether the Union armies were in the field or in camp, Meigs was tireless in his efforts to feed, clothe and arm ""his"" soldiers. Author O'Harrow carefully follows Meigs and details his efforts in a matter-of-fact style. One of the most interesting parts of the book is Chapter 30, ""A Vulnerable Capital. "" One rarely thinks of General Meigs commanding in the field, but he did so, albeit briefly, during the July raid by General Jubal Early on Washington. Working under Major General Alexander McCook, Meigs organized over 5,000 men made up of Home Guards, clerks and invalids. These unlikely soldiers were in the process of clearing away timber and brush from the front of Fort Stevens when the Confederates showed up. The troops under Early were exhausted, and the appearance of a stout defense at Ft. Stevens was enough to hold the fort until the Union VI Corps showed up during the night of July 11-12. For Meigs, performing under the eyes of President Lincoln, this garnered a promotion. He was brevetted a major general on July 5, and signed his correspondence from Fort Stevens: ""Headquarters Meigs' Division. ""</p><p>O'Harrow's portrait of Montgomery Meigs is a very human one. He shows the reader many sides of this complex Union warrior -- none more clearly than Meigs' disgust with his former colleagues Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee or his abiding sadness at the death of his son in action on October 3, 1864. Meigs' most well-known achievement, Arlington National Cemetery (on land that had been Robert E. Lee's home), honors all Union fallen and their grief-stricken families while clearly stating that no one who was not loyal to the United States deserves to have his rights to property reinstated.</p><p>Montgomery C. Meigs was a complicated man. <i>The Quartermaster</i> clearly outlines his myriad accomplishments and never lets the reader forget that these efforts were a vital part of the Union victory in 1865. This book is a valuable addition to those being published lately that begin to veer away from mere battle/campaign analysis, or another look at the common soldier. Meigs was an uncommon soldier in every respect, and O'Harrow's lovingly written, authoritative, and impeccably researched biography goes a long way toward giving him his place among officers like Grant and Sherman. <i>The Quartermaster</i> will join David W. Miller's <i>Second Only to Grant</i> in a small but important list of books about this compelling Union officer.<p><i>Meg Groeling <bloodnight@aol.com> is a current contributor for the blog EmergingCivilWar, author of </i>The Aftermath of Battle: The Burial of the Civil War Dead<i>, and is currently working on </i>First Fallen:The Life & Times of Colonel Elmer Ellsworth.</p>

6569	1469631091	$27.95	American Civil Wars: The United States, Latin America, Europe, and the Crisis of the 1860s		(ed.) Doyle, Don H.			"The 1860s: A Decade of Crisis<p>U.S. historians have long employed the phrase ""the Decade of Crisis"" to refer to the 1850s. This tumultuous decade began with the Compromise of 1850 and ended when South Carolina seceded from the Union. However, used in this way, ""Decade of Crisis"" refers principally to events within the United States and only occasionally considers developments that occurred beyond the borders of the U.S. The essays composing <i>American Civil Wars: The United States, Latin American, Europe, and the Crisis of the 1860s</i> suggest the 1860s were as much a Decade of Crisis as the 1850s, and perhaps more so, because an interrelated series of conflicts unfolded in stunning similar ways throughout the Atlantic World.</p><p>Editor Don H. Doyle, author of the well-regarded <i>The Cause of All Nations</i> (2015), explains that <i>American Civil Wars</i> ""joins the international turn among historians endeavoring to understand the modern past as something more than the sum of national histories"" (1). Since the advent of the transnational turn in U.S. historiography, historians have become more attentive to the international dimensions of U.S. history. Scholars interested in the U.S. Civil War have explored the international elements of the war and the relationship between the U.S. Civil War and other conflicts. The essays in this volume, which correctly posit the entangled nature of their subject matter, should be seen as the productive result of the internationalization of U.S. history. In addition, Doyle notes that the crises of the 1860s featured three common political and social questions: the future of slavery, the future of the republican experiment, and sovereignty. As he astutely comments, ""far more than just territory and geopolitical advantage were at stake in the global contest among rival European empires; the future of slavery and survival of democracy also hung in the balance"" (8).</p><p>To say this volume has a broad scope is an understatement. Jay Sexton begins by analyzing the relationship between the U.S. Civil War and the rise of U.S. power. Although the U.S. Civil War was ""the prerequisite to the emergence of the United States as a world power"" (30), Sexton notes that one of the most striking elements of the postbellum period was ""the crablike trajectory of the era's foreign policy"" (25). Plans for projecting U.S. power abroad, he explains, often gained little traction. Thus, ""the institutions and political relationships forged during the war did not consistently lead to the accumulation and projection of national power, at least in the short term"" (30), although the U.S. Civil War was nevertheless a watershed moment.</p><p>Howard Jones refutes a narrative that has become common: Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation effectively stymied British and French intervention in the U.S. Civil War. In fact, Jones contends, European intervention appeared almost certain at two points: when British Prime Minister Palmerston considered mediation in the fall of 1862 and when Emperor Napoleon III pushed for an armistice. Jones argues that the Emancipation Proclamation added momentum to foreign intervention because the British and French feared a racial conflict. In sum, Jones urges historians to rethink the claim that Lincoln ""prevented British and French intervention by steering the war into an antislavery direction"" (51).</p><p>Patrick J. Kelly examines Confederate imperial ambitions. For a time, Kelly asserts, the rebels renounced expansionism, something historians have failed to explain. Kelly argues that, despite the expansionist dreams of the antebellum U.S. South, Confederate authorities believed expansionism unnecessary and counterproductive. Furthermore, he demonstrates the weakness of the Confederacy as a hemispheric power. By the end of the U.S. Civil War, Kelly concludes, ""it had become apparent to many Southern leaders that the ability of the South to achieve its interests in the Americas depended upon a close alliance with the United States"" (76).</p><p>Essays by Richard Huzzey and Stève Sainlaude complement Jones and Kelly's contributions. Huzzey contends that the British shied away from intervention because of a combination of principles and realpolitik. Furthermore, he notes that ""the projection and illusion of British power in the Americas was dimming even as commercial links, especially to the United States and Brazil, brightened"" (100). Sainlaude contends that French Emperor Napoleon III considered intervention in Mexico one of his highest priorities. Sainlaude's essay highlights an example of a war within a war; between Napoleon III who ""considered the Confederates to be his natural allies"" (114) and Ministers of Foreign Affairs Thouvenel and Drouyn de Lhuys who ""argued that a southern victory would pose a greater threat to France's Grand Design than a unified United States"" (115).</p><p>The late Christopher Schmidt-Nowara and Anne Eller provide important insights about the Spanish Empire. Like the French, the Spanish took advantage of U.S. divisions to meddle in the Americas in defiance of the Monroe Doctrine. Although the Spanish attempt to annex Santo Domingo was supposed to solidify slavery and sovereignty in Cuba and Puerto Rico, it instead, Schmidt-Nowara argues, played an important ""role in the protracted crisis of Antillean slavery and Spanish dominion"" (125). Eller provides a detailed examination of this disastrous foreign adventure. She might have drawn stronger comparisons between the situations in the Dominican Republic and Mexico, especially in terms of how occupiers attempted to deal with guerrilla violence, but her essay illustrates the costs of Spain's annexation attempt. In describing how Cubans and Puerto Ricans drew inspiration from the Dominican War of Restoration, Eller offers another reminder of the interconnected nature of the crises of the 1860s.</p><p>Erika Pani analyzes Mexican Conservatives and their monarchist sentiments. For Pani, the most remarkable feature of Mexican monarchism was its inconspicuousness, stilted rhetoric, and the fact that, until the 1860s, monarchy was basically an object of scorn. However, in a world seemingly spinning out of control, ""Conservatives tried to sell monarchy as a system that could domesticate the alluring but dangerous values of the new order"" (176). Pani asserts that ""the crisis of the 1860s engendered different political responses that sought to deal with the transformations of markets and production, and discipline the powerful revolutionary currents of nationalist, republicanism, and socialism"" (180). Although monarchism failed, she concludes that the construction of a Mexican nation-state was not an inevitable outcome.</p><p>Hilda Sabato opens by asserting that by the 1860s, America was basically a republican hemisphere. She contends that ""a crucial dimension of nineteenth century republicanism occupied center stage during the decade: the model of defense and the role of armed institutions in the polity"" (186). In the aftermath of the revolutions of the 1810s and 1820s, Spanish-Americans believed citizens should defend the republic. However, by the 1860s, militias coexisted uneasily with professional armies. Therefore, as Sabato concludes, the 1860s anticipated issues that would arise when liberals ""sought to centralize authority in a strong national state that would monopolize the use of force, discipline the elites, and reshape the citizenry"" (198).</p><p>Matt Childs and Rafael Marquese discuss the impact of the U.S. Civil War on Cuba and Brazil. Childs argues that three events placed Cuba on the path to ending slavery: the Lyons-Seward Treaty of 1862, a period of reform politics in metropolitan Spain, and the Ten Years' War extending the possibility of slaves emancipating themselves. ""The crisis of the 1860s born out of the U.S. Civil War,"" he asserts, ""most certainly began the process that resulted in the destruction of Cuban slavery"" (218). Marquese argues that, for a time, the U.S. served as a protective wall for Brazilian slavery. However, the political impact of the U.S. Civil War, emancipation, and Reconstruction and the impact of U.S. economic growth, triggered a crisis of slavery in Brazil. Marquese's conclusion is striking: ""without the U.S. Civil War, the end of slavery in Brazil would not have happened the way it did. It seems likely that the institution would have continued into the twentieth century -- and perhaps beyond"" (240).</p><p>There is much to like and little to criticize about this volume. However, one critique should be raised. Throughout the volume, there is some inconsistency in how the authors name a certain conflict. Is the conflict fought in the United States from 1861 -- 1865 the ""American"" Civil War or the ""U.S."" Civil War? In a book dedicated to the study of <i>American</i> Civil Wars, it seems somewhat problematic to use ""American"" to refer exclusively to the U.S. conflict. After all, many people at the time, as several chapters illustrate, saw the U.S. Civil War, the French Intervention, the War of Restoration, and the Ten Years' War as interrelated and would have considered all of them <i>American</i> civil wars.</p><p>Critique aside, this is an important book. Doyle has succeeded in assembling a collection showcasing the positive results of scholarly collaboration and how transnational methodologies can enable historians to pose new answers to old questions. This volume will open up additional conversations and inspire other historians to pursue the themes raised by the contributors. These essays are accessible enough to be successfully utilized in upper-level undergraduate seminars and will also work well in graduate seminars.</p><p><i>Evan C.

6524	9780700622696	$26.95	Liberty and Union: The Civil War Era and American Constitutionalism		Huebner, Timothy S.			"The Battle for Meaning and Civil War Era Constitutionalism<p><i>Liberty and Union: The Civil War Era and American Constitutionalism</i> is a remarkably fluidly written and comprehensive account, covering the years 1845 to 1877. It is a terrific study that deserves the widest possible audience.</p> 	<p>Timothy S. Huebner, the Sternberg Professor of History at Rhodes College, is the author of several books on 19th century legal history.</p> 	<p>Writing about the most analyzed period of American history provides many challenges to any historian. How does one look at familiar tales with fresh eyes?</p> 	<p>What makes Huebner's book different from the numerous other accounts of the era is the author's focus on the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. ""This book is about the relationship between the Civil War generation and the founding generation, "" Huebner writes. ""That is, it examines how Americans of the mid-nineteenth century understood the founders' handiwork, the Declaration of Independence of 1776, and the Constitution of 1787"" (ix).</p> 	<p>This is an effective strategy, as the entire Civil War era was in many ways a battle over the exact meaning of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. ""Soldiers on both sides emphasized the protection and preservation of liberty, "" he writes, ""but they held different interpretations of the concept"" (290).</p>	<p>The text made this reviewer look at the Civil War as essentially an argument over what the founders thought about slavery when they wrote those two documents, and how the conflict was basically a disagreement over how the two documents applied to slavery. Nearly every point of disagreement between North and South was grounded in different interpretations of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.</p><p>	**</p>	<p>Both sides in the struggle referred often to the Constitution. Lincoln mentioned the Constitution thirty-eight times in his first inaugural (126). Stonewall Jackson wrote of ""permitting us to enjoy the rights guaranteed to us by the Constitution of our country"" (159).</p> 	<p>The author discusses how the Constitution (which never mentioned the word ""slave"" or ""slavery"" (9)) was viewed differently by both Northerners and Southerners regarding the many issues related to slavery: its expansion west; how it pertained to the return of escaped slaves; and how it impacted the fight for black political representation.</p> 	<p>References to the Constitution where used often throughout the Civil War era. During the secession crisis, future president Andrew Johnson said in a speech, ""Let us stand by the Constitution; and in preserving the Constitution, we shall save the Union"" (341). When Lee surrendered, Grant praised U.S. soldiers for the way they had ""maintained the supremacy of the Union and the Constitution"" (338).</p>	<p>Huebner weaves in the Constitution throughout his book. He shows how the Constitution influenced overall war strategy. And he even gives a lengthy analysis of the Confederates' Constitution.</p><p>	**</p>	<p>Equally crucial as the Constitution were conflicting interpretations of the meaning of the Declaration of Independence. These were central to the ideas behind the period's key dividing issues: abolitionism; black constitutionalism; the <i>Dred Scott</i> case (where Chief Justice Taney argued that the language of the Declaration of Independence was not meant to apply to slaves); and to the very rise of Abraham Lincoln.</p>	<p>Huebner refers to the Declaration of Independence in all sorts of creative ways. For example, it was even used in secession, as the ""Mississippi Resolutions on Succession, "" Huebner notes, ""outlined a litany of outrages, in the style of the American Declaration of Independence, that had been committed by the North against the South"" (118). The Declaration of Independence was mentioned in Davis's inaugural, and, of course, referred to in the Gettysburg Address. (Huebner's entire Gettysburg section, I might add, is especially first-rate.) It was also alluded to by the framers of Reconstruction, and the author even analyzes how the document influenced the 1868 Republican platform (381, 383, 385) and also examines how the country commemorated the document's centennial in 1876.</p>	<p>And it was the key document used in the struggle against slavery. African American leaders in 1864 ""drafted the 'Declaration of Wrongs and Rights, '"" Huebner writes, ""a formal statement modeled on the American Deceleration of Independence, that listed the historical grievances of African Americans while also lauding black military service"" (323).</p>	<p>Though at times the author wonders away from the theme of the differing uses of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, such as during his discussion of the early part of Reconstruction, his focus on the two documents ties the book together. And his discussion of how Lincoln analyzed both documents is a real highlight, especially with regards to the Emancipation Proclamation.</p><p>	**</p>	<p><i>Liberty and Union</i> is also very strong on black history, specifically concerning the cruelties African Americans faced from Southern racism, and the role they played in both winning the Civil War and in forging their own emancipation.</p> 	<p>It remains shocking to this day to read of the way that Southern religious leaders defended slavery, and how the clergy prayed for slavery's continuation (296). Huebner's text is filled with such unsettling accounts. As one Southern general wrote, ""The only mode of making the black race work, was to hold them in a condition of involuntary servitude"" (189).</p> 	<p>In the book's third and final section, focusing on Reconstruction, President Andrew Johnson comes off even worse than perhaps his detractors can imagine. And an especially strong feature of the book is the author's analysis of the ratification process of the three Civil War Amendments.</p>	<p>His section on Reconstruction reminds us how enormously revolutionary that period was. Since the Bill of Rights, Americans had only added two amendments to the Constitution, he notes, but would add three during Reconstruction.</p>	<p>In Huebner's telling, Grant comes across as bold at first but then timid, worried about how harsh treatment of the South would affect his party.</p>	<p>Above all, the book is topical. One of the many moving passages is Huebner's account of the vicious response to black voting, an issue still very much with us today.</p>	<p>The story of the implementation of black suffrage during Reconstruction still amazes. Yet the lost promise of Reconstruction will anger most readers. While ""most Northerners believed that abolition itself constituted an historic triumph, "" Huebner writes, ""... most Republicans had not accepted the black constitutionalist vision, which combined the belief in a vigorous national government with a commitment to the idea that 'all men were created equal'"" (433).</p> <p>	**</p>	<p>The text sometimes has the feel of a standard survey of the era, with the insights about the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution cut and pasted in; other times, this theme disappears entirely for pages upon pages.</p> 	<p>Huebner recounts incredibly detailed and vivid battle scenes, but occasionally gets bogged down in excessive detail that might distract the non-specialist, such as his recounting of the precise maneuvering of specific flanks, the time of day of the generals' discussions, etc. (178). Also, Huebner can at times get long-winded when speaking of Supreme Court cases (376).</p> 	<p>And the book's length could have been cut; the biographies of many of the era's leading figures and the basic common knowledge of the era could have been slightly shortened. At the same time, there is also not much on gender or Native Americans or the home front. But it is foolish to ask an author to include everything.</p>	<p>And this reviewer wished publishers used footnotes instead of endnotes, as many readers would enjoy referring to them in an easier fashion as they read along.</p><p>	**</p> 	<p>Yet this is a remarkable study. The book is enhanced by helpful subheadings within each chapter, and the narrative has a clear flow to it. The text has terrific chapter organizations, especially introductions and conclusions.</p>	<p>One aspect that stood out to this reviewer was the manuscript's sense of balance. For example, he describes how both sides spoke of having God on their side.</p> 	<p>It is tempting, in any overview of the era, to focus on the North, but Huebner describes in equal measure both North and South. There is also evenly matched attention given to political, economic, military, and social and cultural history (though the first 100 pages are dominated by political history).</p> 	<p>Huebner's study is steeped in primary sources, especially personal letters. ""Southern soldiers fought for slavery, "" he writes, ""but mentioned it far fewer times in their writings than they did 'liberty'"" (293).</p>	<p>There is also an outstanding 11-page bibliographical essay (but I was surprised to only see one David Donald reference on the list).</p> 	<p>The book is filled with wonderful nuggets, moving the story along briskly.</p> 	<p>I imagine few know that Lincoln only met his vice president, Hannibal Hamlin, until shortly after they were elected. Or that the Gettysburg Address was Lincoln's ""first prepared speech since his inauguration"" (241). Or that one senator, in 1861, proposed abolishing the Supreme Court and replacing it with only Republican appointees. Or that ""An estimated 40,000 soldiers perished in accidents"" (317). Or that Virginia and Tennessee had the most amount of military engagements and destruction. Or that ""The 14th Amendment proved disappointing to black activists, who wondered publicly how the Constitution could affirm black citizenship without directly conferring the right to vote"" (361). Or that in 1866 ""Johnson implied that Providence had brought about the death of Lincoln in order to make Johnson president"" (363). Or that ""Because they had not yet ratified the Fourteenth Amendment, Mississippi, Texas, and Virginia did not participate in"" the 1868 election (383)--which makes this reader wonder if Grant would have lost the popular vote had those states voted; after all, he ""failed to win a majority of the white vote"" (384).</p>	<p>Huebner's writing is wonderfully lively. He describes one Southerner as having ""long hair and short temper"" (130). Sherman believed, in Huebner's words, that ""there would be no peace without victory, and no victory without abolition"" (247). And he writes that ""Violent white supremacists, as well as the majority of Southerners who opposed them, moreover, linked the ballot box to the bedroom"" (428).</p> 	<p>Huebner's majestic narrative skills surface in other areas as well. He subtly writes that Lee surrendered to Grant ""at a private home in the village of Appomattox Court House"" (337), a fine distinction to make, as many people mistakenly believe that the surrender took place in a court house in the town of Appomattox. It is details such as this that show a master craftsman at work.</p>	<p>And there are numerous lessons for and links to modern day America to be found here.</p>	<p>For one, his study reveals that people then were perhaps more engaged with politics and current affairs than today. They were even knowledgeable about the Supreme Court: one anti-slavery activist gave a speech that mocked the language of Justice Roger Taney; it is hard to imagine someone today doing that with an opinion by Justice John Roberts.</p>	<p>Above all, <i>Liberty and Union</i> reminds us that discussion and debate about racial disparities is central to the American story, and that while the passion for racial justice among some today echoes that of the Civil War era, it appears as if there is less overall interest in racial justice today than there was 160 years ago.</p>	<p>The book is a culmination of a life-long devotion to the topic. <i>Liberty and Union</i> should be of special interest to instructors of survey courses on the Civil War and Reconstruction. (Instead of why the North won, Heubner's book seems to ask, the question that should be asked is why the South lost. Huebner's answer is that they could not fund the war.)</p>	<p>I find it hard to believe that the book has not been more widely reviewed and publicized. It is simply a masterpiece.</p> <p><i>Dr. Bernard von Bothmer is an adjunct professor of history at the University of San Francisco and Dominican University of California.

6457	9781451645903	$28.00	The Civil Wars of Julia Ward Howe, A Biography		Showalter, Elaine			"The Battle Hymn of a Marriage  <p>Feminist literary critic and biographer Elaine Showalter has written a harrowing book about the appalling marriage that compels readers from page to page in an effort to make sense of the complex emotional life, and marital and professional negotiations made by a woman known to American public school students as author of the Civil War anthem, “Battle Hymn of the Republic"".  Born in 1819 to Julia Cutler Ward and Samuel Ward, a wealthy New York banker, Julia Ward married Dr. Samuel Gridley Howe, known as ""Chev"", in 1843 at the age of twenty-four. She bore and reared their six children, grieving deeply for the death of their youngest, Sammy (Samuel Gridley Howe, Jr.) of diphtheria at the age of four in 1863. She wrote and published plays, and several books of poetry, including <i>Passion-Flowers,</i> in 1853, a deeply personal book of which her husband greatly disapproved. A serious depression forced Howe to examine her life, her marriage, and her work. As she looked forward, she saw only “the weary, tasteless life, without a single point of interest in it!"" She saw a wasteland crossed and re-crossed in endless battle with Chev. She feared the closing off of a life as a public bard, shunted aside by such men as Walt Whitman, and loosing a valued public commission to Annie Fields for her first published poem. Howe’s scathing review hurt her reputation among the very New England poets and intellectuals whom she courted for approval, and forced her to apologize.</p>   <p>During the war years, Fields turned to public lecturing, a challenge to Chev’s passionate opposition. Showalter views these years as a turning point in a deteriorating marriage that, while rarely easy, grew ever more conflicted. From April 1865, Showalter argues, the relationship fundamentally changed. While Julia retained some loyalty to Chev, she no longer depended upon his approval or support for her activities. Writes Schowalter, on page 174, ""The national conflict had enabled her to resolve the personal one."" She observed that the War had challenged women to broaden the scope of their concerns, engage in new activities, and develop new abilities.</p>  <p>Widowed in January 1876, Howe returned to Europe the following year and spent two years traveling about there and in the Middle East. Reliant upon her brother financially, due to her husband’s control over her inheritance from her father and his rejection of her in his own will, Howe returned to Boston and took up writing about the lives of famous women and speaking before women’s groups.  In 1884, she undertook a paid job heading up the Woman’s Department for the New Orleans Cotton Centennial, an awkward fit and extraordinary choice for an abolitionist, and a controversial selection in the eyes of the white southern women it was her job to celebrate.  Howe spent much of the rest of her life working toward woman's suffrage as the foreign corresponding secretary of the American Woman Suffrage Association. </p>  <p>In her 1899 <i>Reminiscences</i>, Howe weighed her life and labors. She made the remarkable assessment that it had been a great ""distinction for me when the foremost philanthropist of the age chose me for his wife."" This important man had selected her for her money and class connections, and erroneously viewed her as malleable. She may truly have appreciated the ""distinction"", that is the visibility and entrée into intellectual society that his position and connections offered her. However, it seems unlikely that this peon offered more than cover for her dead husband’s reputation and her own disturbing marriage. Howe struggled with his need to dominate her body and soul, his rejection of her talents, and the enormous emotional pain he inflicted on her and, tellingly, on his protégé, the blind and deaf Laura Bridgman.</p>  <p>Showalter’s biography focuses on the private life of Julia Ward Howe and her marriage to Samuel Gridley Howe, physician and director of the Perkins Institute for the Blind in Boston, Massachusetts.  A judgmental, domineering, cold man, Howe found much to criticize in his wife.  Despite their many children, he seems to have had little interest in sex with Julia, and it seemed more a product of his need to dominate his wife or demonstrate his masculinity, rather than to express a physical need or the emotion of love.  Men drew Chev’s affections, particularly Charles Sumner who stood as best man to Howe at his wedding to Julia. She believed herself an ""object of [his] disgust,"" physically as well as emotionally. He seemed not to value, and certainly offered, her little in the way of companionship, whether intellectual, physical, or social.</p>   <p>How are we to understand this passionate woman, whose marital life was so full of strain and woe?  In the mid-to-late 1840s, but a few years into her marriage, Howe authored an extraordinary manuscript that, although neither finished nor published in her lifetime, may have given voice to her sense of confusion about her marriage and her husband’s, her gender and/or sexuality and his.  The manuscript told the story of a hermaphrodite whose body carried both male and female sexual organs. Named Lawrence, this character was raised as a boy. Showalter argues on page 88 that, in providing ""both a metaphor for her own feelings of androgyny and a meditation on her husband’s emotional and sexual absence, the story reveals a wildly unconventional side of her imagination, with hidden depths of sexual fantasy, anger, and protest."" And so it does.</p> <p>While the first half of Howe’s life and marriage suggests something of a feminist morality tale, the death in life of a married woman of talent, smothered by her husband’s selfishness, greed, vanity, sexism and, possibly, unacknowledged homosexuality, Howe’s second act offers a different story.  Howe devoted herself to the political rights of women, to her economic self-support and social independence. Showalter has given us not the common story of a woman who simply endured an embattled marriage by practicing her craft however modestly, but that of a passionate woman who challenged herself to grow intellectually, to pursue adventure abroad, to explore new social relationships, to undertake political leadership at home, even in the face of sectional antagonism, and to imagine unconventionally.</p> <p><i>An historian of nineteenth-century American women and gender, Lee V.

6412	9780806143958	$19.95	The Civil War Journal of Mary Adelia Byers		Phillips, Samuel R.			"The Civil War Journal of Mary Adelia Byers: A Valuable Look at Adolescence in the Civil War Era<p>Even in 2016, the home front is still a fairly new theater of operations in Civil War studies, being only about a generation old. As late as 1989, social and family historian Maris A. Vinovskis could write that, despite many thousands of books and articles on the American Civil War, ""we do not know much about the effects of the Civil War on everyday life in the United States."" Surveying the field, he adds, ""Very little has been published on civilian life in the North or the South during the war years....""<sup> </sup> </p><p>Samuel R. Phillips' <i>The Civil War Journal of Mary Adelia Byers</i> is a nice addition to the available sources in this theater. Mary Adelia Byers was in 1862 a fifteen-year old girl living in Batesville, Arkansas, when it was occupied for a time by Union Major General Samuel R. Curtis' Trans-Mississippi Army of the Southwest, recent victors at the Battle of Pea Ridge in northwest Arkansas. Her family had moved to Batesville in 1837 from Ohio like many American families to find greater opportunity and prosperity. After the death of Mary's father, John, in 1855 from tuberculosis, his older brother William, a lawyer and landowner, generously settled his brother's estate and watched over his family.</p><p>Women's Civil War diaries are not unknown, though only a fraction of them were kept by young girls. Some women immediately attracted attention to their journals in Civil War histories because of the activities they undertook in wartime or for the positions they occupied in society that gave them a unique perspective. Mary Chesnut comes to mind; the fascination with Mary Chesnut's diary stems in large part from the perspective it offers, that of an adult woman and an able commentator with a mature and sophisticated point of view. Chesnut lived at the seat of the rebellion, was in contact with male participants among the higher ranks of the Confederate Army, and was connected by marriage and status to highest levels of Southern society. Like many such works of history, it offers a top-down view.</p><p>Women also served as spies, nurses, and even as soldiers, and the apparently idiosyncratic character of at least two of those roles long ago caught the attention of students of the war. Belle Boyd, Antonia Ford, and Harriet Tubman spied; Clara Barton, Dorothea Dix, and Louisa May Alcott nursed; and Frances Clayton, Jennie Hodgers, and Mary Galloway among others fought. Women young and old often undertook the role assigned by the French Committee of Public Safety to the aged--modified suitably to fit the needs of the Confederacy or the Union as needs be--who were to ""betake themselves to the public places in order to arouse the courage of the warriors and preach the hatred of kings and the unity of the Republic."" </p><p>Young women like Mary Byers who did not have such an exciting war attracted little attention from historians. Until recently, most of the Americans who lived during the war, whether they stayed home or went to war, remained unknown. Only a comparative few left significant records of their experiences in any case, which makes the recovery and publication of accounts like Mary's important to help to resolve the somewhat gauzy and incomplete picture of the home front into something more distinct and useful. Mary's diary, if not unique, is also a useful source for studying the younger voices from Civil War era, something not widely available. </p> <p>Mary's is a young girl's voice who seems at the same time to be much older. If fifteen seems a very young age nowadays, it is hard to see Mary as comparable to American teenager of the same calendar age. After reading a few pages of her diary, it seems obvious and not just the repetition of a worn platitude to say that people grew up faster in the old days. It is hard to imagine such a document being written when so much modern social discourse is limited to 140 characters or to Photoshopped images plastered with a meme suitable to not very thoughtful consideration. Her education is to be wondered at: how does a young girl in Arkansas know anything about Drury Lane Theater and the <i>Great Eastern</i>? It gives the reader a slight measure of a society that, if not as connected as people imagine themselves to be in modern times, still accommodated the spread of ideas and news over great distances. </p><p>As diaries must, Mary's includes passages of self-examination: ""I am prone to judge people too harshly. I must quit it for I wrong others as well as myself. But I am always boasting of my perception and I find out to my chagrin that I am very often sadly mistaken."" (7) It also contains some scenes that are timeless. On July 20, 1862, Mary's diary entry records the ride home from the Fairchild's Sun Fish plantation north of Batesville in company with eighteen-year old John Smith. In words that many other generations of young women in life and in literature have spoken, she writes, ""I don't understand him...."" The conversation that plays out next would have been new to Mary and John--even their names are iconic--but familiar and touching for many later couples facing similar circumstances. </p><p> ""This evening coming home as we passed the telegraph he asked if I wouldn't send him some dispatches when they got to Little Rock. I said, ""Of course,"" when the telegraph is established. He then asked if I would not answer his letters when he wrote to me. I said that I would, but my letters wouldn't be interesting, for I couldn't write good letters. He said that was what the girls always said. We then spoke of drinking and playing cards. I asked him neither to touch liquor or cards until he returned. He replied that he would not for one reason, because it was my advice; that he would tell me when he came back (and he expected to get a furlough in about a month), and I should see how good he was at keeping promises."" One smiles slightly at the obvious modesty of Mary's claim in the face of contrary evidence that she could not ""write good letters,"" but might wonder at the same time how John knew ""what the girls always said."" Naturally this archetypal entry ends with an archetypal coda: ""When I came home I told Ma; she does not want me to correspond with any gentlemen."" (13-14) </p><p>Diaries are often a pleasure to read and not always because they advance scholarship, yield new understanding, or reveal unknown secrets. Diaries may or may not change our view of the past in any significant way. Often the information they offer simply confirms the unremarkable sorts of things that the reader knows already to be true and common. Nonetheless they can have a voyeuristic quality. They provide valuable and sometimes startlingly intimate windows into the past even when they do not tell us anything new. They simply confirm, like an ancient Greek play to a modern audience, that people are fairly constant in their emotions and behaviors and remain unchanged over centuries, let alone over a few decades. </p> <p>Phillips, who is Mary's great-grandson, makes good use of footnotes to identify many of individuals mentioned in the diary. The use of footnotes is to be commended and will be appreciated by anyone who dislikes the intrusion that comes from searching for the correct endnote. The reader would have benefited from an introductory section that provided more background to the diary. The few pages of the introduction cover family background, but apply only a very broad-brush to current events. Head notes for the chapters or for selected time periods would also have helped with context. Nonetheless, the diary provides a useful contribution to the history of the Civil War at home that is also a pleasure to read.</p><p><i>Larry Grant is an Adjunct Professor at the Citadel and author of numerous of articles including ""Duncan N.

6510	9780806155722	$34.95	Civil War in the Southwest Borderlands, 1861-1867		Masich, Andrew			"The Civil War's civil wars<p>Civil War historiography has been well served by the recent proliferation of borderland studies. This burgeoning corner of the conflict's literature has added nuance to our understanding of emancipation, the war in Appalachia, the Confederate diaspora, the Native American experience, and the war's transnational dimensions. <i>Civil War in the Southwest Borderlands</i> by Andrew E. Masich is an accessible and well-researched addition to the literature.</p>   <p>In this sweeping, largely narrative history, Masich argues ""that cultural groups fought civil wars in the Southwest Borderlands concurrent with and connected to the American Civil War and that such wars often occur when two or more ethnically or culturally distinct peoples occupy the same space and vie for survival and dominance"" (4) The war between the Union and the Confederacy created new and oftentimes more destructive conflicts in a region already burdened with long standing tension and rivalries.</p><p>At its core, <i>Civil War in the Southwest Borderlands</i> is a comparative study of Anglo, Hispano, and Indian martial cultures. Prior to the outbreak of the American Civil War armed conflict between these groups was characterized by raid and reprisal warfare in which the destruction of one's enemy was rarely the ultimate goal. Within this limited war tradition, Indians often emerged victorious against Anglos and Hispanos. However, after 1861 warring Union and Confederate forces introduced total war to the borderlands. Aside from an escalation in violence, the Civil War reordered the social hierarchy of the region. Anglo-American influence in the region drastically increased while, for Indians, the Civil War years is a story of decline.</p><p>Anglo, Hispano, and Indian combatants all strove to fulfill the obligations of ""martial manhood"" as constructed by their respective cultures. While strategies, tactics, and motivations varied among the three groups, Masich shows that ""in all cases, alliances, accommodation, and compromises characterized the survival strategies of each cultural community"" (73). A martial middle-ground existed in the borderlands during the 1860s. Alliances and compromises were both facilitated and hindered by the ethno-centrism that was ubiquitous in the southwest. ""Each ethnic group,"" the author argues, ""feared, misunderstood, and imagined the worst of the others"" (36). Indians, Hispanos, and Anglos were all willing to go to extremes to secure their own community's security. A vicious cycle of actual and rumored atrocities and reprisals accompanied this environment of fear, chaos, internecine conflict, and ethno-centrism.</p> <p>To Masich's credit, he has authored a book that is accessible to many audiences. Traditional Civil War scholars are provided with enough contextual information to guide them through the labyrinthine ethnic and cultural conflicts occurring in the southwest while Native American and Latin American scholars will find utility in the comparisons of martial cultures.  At times, the author provides an overabundance of contextual information and vignettes; some of the narrative could be expunged for the sake of concision. Much of the first chapter, for example, is dedicated to rehashing the Mexican-American War and recounting settlement patterns of various Indian groups.</p><p>While the book would have benefited from tighter editing, Oklahoma University Press should be applauded for allowing the inclusion of lavish illustrations, charts, appendices, and a glossary -- the latter of which will be especially useful for readers unfamiliar with Native American and Hispano terminology.  Moreover, Masich's research is nothing short of staggering; over a hundred pages of the volume are devoted to documentation. In addition to synthesizing a vast amount of secondary literature from multiple disciplines, the author consulted an impressive array of primary sources including the previously neglected Indian Depredation Claims Records.</p> <p>Readers hoping to broaden their understanding of the Civil War beyond the storied campaigns of the Union and Confederate armies will find Masich's volume useful. Other scholars will be enriched by the authors discussion of martial cultures and the transnational dimensions of the war. While some readers will understandably object to Masich's expansive narration, <i>Civil War in the Southwest Borderlands</i> is a worthy addition to the conflict's literature.</p><p><i>Robert L.

6622	9781469632049	$34.95	Midnight in America: Darkness, Sleep, and Dreams during the Civil War		White, Jonathan W.			"The Comforts of Sleep and Bonds of Intimacy	<p>Think of a Civil War battlefield and visions of blood, smoke, fire, mutilation, and the cries of the wounded and the dying come to mind.  George W. Peck, an infantryman from Wisconsin, surely witnessed his share of those horrors.  But when he fell asleep one night he ""dreamed that all of the bullets used in the war were made of India rubber 'and war was just fun.'  'There was no more blood,'"" Peck later recounted.  ""'There was no one killed, no legs shot off, and men on each side, when not fighting with harmless missiles, were gathered together, blue and gray, having a regular picnic, and every evening there was a dance, the rebels furnishing the girls.'"" (p. 49) Peck's nighttime fantasy is one of many shared in Jonathan White's analysis of over 400 dreams of Civil War America.  Eschewing any psychological analysis beyond the symbolic meanings ascribed by the dreamers themselves, White nonetheless suggests that dreams helped soldiers and civilians alike to cope with the trauma of war.</p>	<p>As in most wars, a great gulf divided Civil War combatants from the civilian world of the home front.  The monotony and discomfort of camp life, the exhaustion of long marches, and the fear and exhilaration of the battlefield distanced soldiers from their former lives and from their loved ones back home.  Sleep brought dreams that bridged that gap, especially because so many Americans were willing to share them in their letters.  Sleep itself became a touchstone connecting men to their wives.  Soldiers penned details in their letters of sleeping stretched out on the hard ground or crowded with bedmates in flimsy tents while their wives replied with reminders of the comforts and pleasures that awaited them in cozier beds.  The contrast could be demoralizing but at the same time, the mundane familiarity of bedtime anchored many letters to and from the battlefield.  When those soldiers did succumb to exhausted slumber, they often dreamed of home and homecomings.   Anxieties intruded, of course, especially of infidelity and death, and correspondents were remarkably willing to share their fears, even women who faced social pressure to maintain a positive outlook to boost morale.  Dollie Vermillion of Iowa described her sense of desolation to her husband and confessed some guilt over that admission of feelings.  ""'Sometimes I am patriotic, and I feel that it would be a glorious thing to live, or die, in defense of a country so just and holy.  But my heart is truer than my head.'"" (60)  News of battles sometimes triggered northern women's dreams of being transported to the front, while southern women were more likely to dream about the war intruding on their lives.  Sarah Morgan dreamt of watching the bombardment of her Louisiana home while standing in blood up to her knees, while a Kentucky woman dreamt of black and white soldiers sharing rations and marching off to battle alongside one another.</p><p>White argues that those shared bedtime routines and dreams, both happy and distressing, knit together bonds of emotional intimacy that helped soldiers and civilians transcend wartime trauma.  He also suggests that the willingness to share dreams with loved ones reflected the persistence of a sentimental culture that celebrated domesticity.  Indeed, soldiers' dreams of home became a popular culture motif, popping up in poems, songs, and prints during and long after the Civil War.</p>  	<p>African Americans, at least those who wrote about their escapes from slavery, did not have reassuring dreams of homecomings.  Instead, men like Solomon Northrup and Charles Ball suffered nightmares about the families they had left behind, suggesting that even sleep did not bring respite from the traumas of enslavement.  White's chapter on African-American dreams moves beyond the Civil War to cover the antebellum period as well.  He emphasizes commonalities and divisions in the ""dream culture"" of whites and blacks. (95)  Many of the folk beliefs about the meanings of dreams had both African and European roots. Southern whites and blacks often interpreted dreams as mirror images by assigning opposite meanings to objects and events.  A vision of a hearse, for example, signaled an upcoming wedding.  However, White also argues that prophetic dreams retained a central place in African-American religion while white evangelicals by the mid-nineteenth century increasingly scoffed at such superstitions.  On page 84, White notes that while ""dreams and visions had been an important part of white and black religious experiences during the antebellum period, they were diminishing in white Christian practices by the time of the Civil War.""  By the end of the chapter, on pages 99-100, he seems to retreat a bit from that argument.  ""This is not to say that white Christians outright rejected that dreams could carry spiritual meaning -- far from it,"" White writes.  Instead they ""more often shared their dreams with one another quietly, in letters and publications, or over the breakfast table, not in public places of worship,"" while African Americans brought dreams to ""their public rituals and professions of faith.""</p>	<p>That question of whether or not white Americans had retreated from a supernatural interpretation of dreams is central to White's chapter on dreams about dying.  Soldiers often recounted nighttime visions of their own deaths in their letters and in conversations with their comrades.  When those dreams proved true, they found their way into postwar memoirs and regimental histories.  White argues on pages 103 and 104 that ""a form of supernatural or providential thinking about dreams and premonitions persisted among many Civil War veterans"" and helped survivors ""find inspiration and hope in suffering and death.""  The most famous dreams of death, of course, belonged to Abraham Lincoln.  In a fascinating final chapter, White carefully analyzes the ways in which accounts of those dreams spread after his assassination and shifted in tone and interpretation before concluding that they were false.</p> 		<p><i>Midnight in America</i> ranges throug many topics and is a wonderful addition to the voluminous literature on the Civil War.  White has done prodigious research in gathering up the myriad accounts of dreams and has presented them in an interpretive framework that illuminates larger meanings about the persistence of sentimentality and spiritualism.  Forgoing psychological interpretation, he lets the dreams, and the dreamers, speak for themselves.  In doing so, White offers us a glimpse into an intimate world that existed beneath the surface of the Civil War.</p><p><i>Daniel Dupre is an Associate Professor of History at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.

6396	9780393241570	$39.95	William Tecumseh Sherman In the Service of my Country: A Life		McDonough, James Lee			"The Continuing Relevance of William Sherman<p>When William Sherman was yet a cadet at West Point, he proudly declared himself ""in the service of my country"" (161).  James McDonough chronicles this journey of service that brought Sherman from humble cadet to full general in <i>William Tecumseh Sherman: In the Service of My Country: A Life</i>.  Among the more notable themes McDonough explores throughout the hefty work are Sherman's growth; his mastery of logistics, maneuver, and risk; and his resiliency. </p>  <p>Harry Williams considered Sherman to be one of the North's two most outstanding examples of growth as a general.  (Grant was the other.)  Nearly each chapter of McDonough's narrative provides some example of this phenomenon.  It is easy to appreciate what Sherman became by understanding his formative experiences. </p><p>Almost immediately after graduating from West Point, Sherman began developing a ""distrust of the American Political landscape"" that McDonough notes ""hardened in the following months and years"" (65).  Sherman decided early he wanted no part of politics, and he would never change.  ""Not even decades later,"" McDonough notes, ""when he knew that he probably could be the nation's president if he so desired"" (66).  Instead, Sherman remained on the military side of serving his country, rising to general-in-chief, but with the position, enduring the ""inevitable frustrations"" of the ""Washington political scene"" (702). </p><p>Sherman is perhaps most widely associated in the common conscious with the increasing tendency toward total war that developed during the Civil War.  McDonough traces the origins of Sherman's experience with the concept to his service during the Seminole War where he witnessed the efficiency of Colonel William Worth's policy of raiding Seminole villages, burning their huts, and destroying their corn.  Sherman did not forget the tactic, and resurfaced the concept ""with a vengeance during the Civil War, at the expense of the Confederacy"" (69). </p><p>This experience in Florida was just one of Sherman's pre-war postings in the South.  He also served four years at Fort Moultrie on Sullivan's Island outside Charleston, South Carolina, the very birthplace of secession.  On the eve of the Civil War, he found himself as the superintendent of the Louisiana State Seminary of Learning (the forerunner of Louisiana State University) and watched as the South prepared for war.  These experiences provided Sherman with a valuable frame of reference about the Southern people and region, and he put this knowledge to good effect.  Of his most famous Civil War campaign, Sherman reported, ""I knew more of Georgia than the rebels did"" (87). </p><p>Perhaps most significant in Sherman's development was his ever-deepening relationship with Ulysses Grant, which began during the Fort Donelson Campaign (309).  After the two beat back near defeat at Shiloh, criticism of Grant's unpreparedness on the first day of the battle brought Grant to the brink of leaving the Army.  Sherman encouraged Grant to stay, and in so doing, ""rendered a major service to his country"" (327).  He also took their relationship to a new level of trust and respect, and the two generals would ultimately execute the synchronized strategy that brought the Union victory. </p> <p>After Shiloh, Sherman was plagued by Southern guerrillas that infested the countryside around Memphis and throughout western Tennessee.  He developed a policy of ""collective responsibility"" that held ""the whole neighborhood fully responsible"" whenever guerrillas attacked his troops (338).  It was the same concept that Sherman would practice as he swept across Georgia, explaining to Henry Halleck that ""we are not only fighting hostile armies, but a hostile people, and must make old and young, rich and poor, feel the hard hand of war, as well as their organized armies."" </p><p>When it came time for that famous march, Sherman divided his army into two wings on separate routes.  This configuration served Sherman well, allowing him to keep the enemy guessing about the army's destination, facilitate foraging, and expand the swath of destruction.  Sherman had experimented with the same tactic on his Meridian Campaign after Vicksburg, and gained ""firsthand convincing evidence that he could lead an army through the heart of Rebel territory, living off the land with no supply line whatsoever, and the enemy could not stop him"" (454).  Armed with this experience, Sherman replicated it in Georgia on a much larger scale (562). </p><p>In addition to chronicling Sherman's growth as a general, McDonough reinforces the common assessment that Sherman's genius lay in logistics and maneuver.  It was Sherman's grasp of logistics that McDonough notes enabled him ""to supply his armies, as well as feed the thousands of animals those forces required, while seizing and maintaining the offensive against the Rebel army.  The closer he drew to Atlanta, the longer grew his line of communications, and the more impressive was this achievement"" (325).   Atlanta also proved Sherman's mastery of maneuver warfare.  ""Time and again,"" McDonough reports, ""he successfully performed turning movements, enabling him to maintain the offensive initiative, avoid the enemy's strongpoints, exploit the enemy's vulnerability and largely determine the course of combat, thus presenting his opponent the undesirable choice of retreating or accepting battle"" (549-550).  McDonough cites Sherman's expertise with logistics and maneuver as ""among the most significant reasons that he has long been more relevant than other generals of the American Civil War"" (550). </p><p>Sherman is also admired by modern day students of the military art for his capacity to manage risk, and his marches deep into enemy territory such as the Meridian and Atlanta Campaigns are obvious examples.  McDonough does service to this aspect of Sherman's military genius by also noting the risk Sherman handled in dealing with John Bell Hood's move to Tennessee after the Battle of Atlanta.  Leaving George Thomas to deal with Hood, knowing that Andrew Jackson Smith was speeding Union reinforcements to Nashville, Sherman found the risk posed by Hood acceptable relative to the devastation Sherman anticipated inflicting on the Confederate psyche during his march across Georgia.  Sherman, McDonough astutely observes, had become ""a master at calculating risks"" (579). </p><p>McDonough also highlights Sherman's resiliency.  His pre-Civil War career was ""increasingly hard and, for the most part, unrewarding"" (62).  It included service in California where he ""never once engaged in combat, while his West Point peers were winning military laurels in Mexico.""  The experience, McDonough notes, ""proved keenly disappointing and even embarrassing to a man of Sherman's abilities, ambition and dedication to the armed services of his country"" (124-125).  Sherman resigned from the army only to be part of a failed bank venture which included the loss of some $130,000 he had invested for his army friends.  Although the bank was not obligated to cover these losses, Sherman took it upon himself to make good the losses -- even though his own investments were virtually depleted -- in what McDonough calls ""evidence of both an extraordinary high personal ethical standard and, more, a deep sense of military camaraderie"" (213).  Then of course there is Sherman's failed command in Kentucky that brought with it charges he was ""crazy.""   Sherman recovered from this near disaster by ""the proverbial godsend"" of Fort Donelson that McDonough writes put Sherman ""back in the war in a big way"" (308). </p><p>At 816 pages, <i>William Tecumseh Sherman: In the Service of My Country: A Life</i> is not for the casual reader.  Yet for one interested in exploring what McDonough advertises in the title: the life of a man's service to his country, it is well worth the investment. </p><p><i>Kevin Dougherty is the Assistant Commandant for Leadership Programs at The Citadel.

6461	9780807163382	 $48.00	Occupied Vicksburg		Clampitt, Bradley R.			"The Cultural Work of Military Occupation<p>With <i>Occupied Vicksburg</i>, Bradley R. Clampitt contributes a well-researched monograph about Union military occupation in the Confederate South to a field that has been slowly burgeoning over the years. Clampitt skillfully balances heady discussions of Union military policy with adept analysis of the tedious challenge of civilian affairs -- topics that frequently overlap. And here is perhaps the book's primary feature. When he states ""Federals found [in Vicksburg] a backward society that to their minds needed to be reshaped in the image of the North,"" Clampitt demonstrates how Union military occupation was, in addition to a military project, also a cultural project, sculpting the social landscape of the Confederate South even as it dominated the physical terrain itself (42). Military history then, in some or many ways, is social history as well.</p><p>For too long military history has been limited to studies of battles, tactics, and discussions of various army ordinance. But real men (and women) live in the ranks of the army, and every move of a massive ground force affects the civilians around it. So too, as Clampitt's occupation study finds, do the actions of civilians pressure the military. In the wake of Vicksburg's surrender in July 1863, Ulysses Grant, William Sherman, and a host of other ranking men in blue fretted continuously about policies concerning prisoner parole, food rationing, recently freed slaves, and rebellious Confederate women, all of which hampered further military operations in the region.</p><p>Conquest is a hard thing to maintain. Clampitt traces the evolution of Union war policy from one of reconciliation to hard war intended to break the back of the Confederate war machine and demoralize its citizens. Reconciliation policies did not translate into southern converts in Vicksburg, who appreciated Federal welfare assistance they felt was their due anyway, but nursed continued resentment in their hearts toward Yankee invaders. African Americans who wandered around Union lines at will, sat in refugee camps and schools, expected payment for their labor, and even stole food to survive, incensed southern citizens in Vicksburg. When armed and trained African American troops appeared in town, southerners were even more outraged, attributing the defection of former slaves to the degenerative effects of Northern influence. Yet Clampitt discerningly argues that emancipation policy was always second to preserving the Union in the eyes of Federal military commanders like Grant. The exponential increase of freed slaves and their movements burdened an insufficient occupation system. Some time would pass -- and no small amount of bickering between the Federal military command in Mississippi and the Treasury Department -- before Northern policy makers in and around Vicksburg could develop a consistent labor program that did not exploit Black labor as the Union army often did throughout the first part of the war. Military and treasury administrators oversaw redistribution of land and its lease, secured physical protection for freedpeople against white backlash, established schools, and regulated African American labor on the new land portions. Northern missionaries, burdened nevertheless by paternalistic and condescending outlooks on African Americans, also contributed to the initial stages of economic and educational development that would come to characterize the brief reign of Radical Reconstruction. Through it all, freedmen and women shaped their own freedom as well, setting up communities within the city of Vicksburg and on plantations and camps in the area under Union control long before the military figured out what to do. In these communities, African Americans celebrated freedom, established families under the auspices of conventional white mores, and inaugurated a thriving church culture that presented even some Union soldiers with religious interest. As Union war policy slowly flexed to include emancipation as a war aim, so too did the Union soldiers in Vicksburg come to value emancipation as a moral crusade against the culturally backward South.</p><p>Clampitt deserves particular consideration (and some scrutiny) for his approach to the subject of gender in his book. Without using the word ""gender"" once, Clampitt discusses at length the troublesome opposition of Vicksburg's Confederate ladies against a Federal occupation that introduced ""social revolution""upon their homeland"" (188). Southern women visited rhetorical wrath on Union troops and commanders, constantly petitioned for greater consideration and aid, smuggled trade goods, and demonstrated their patriotic allegiance to the Confederacy through public displays of disgust for Union presence. In response, the Union military feared and jeered southern women, materially supported those whose homes they had destroyed through war and raiding, and even expelled some women from the city. It is important for Clampitt to note that Union occupiers never underestimated how imposing Confederate women's resistance could be. Acknowledging alternative figures and alternative resistance is crucial to understanding the hybrid military/social history to be found in occupation studies. That said, Clampitt could do more on this subject, and he could use a gender analysis far more thoroughly in a book with no shortage of valuable examinations on race and class prejudice in occupied Vicksburg. For instance, a short paragraph on page 130 represents Clampitt's entire discussion of Union sexual violence against African American women, who collectively experienced higher and more deadly rates of assault than their white counterparts before, during, and after the Civil War. Emancipation was an enormously complicated and ambiguous process; it was also gendered. Black men joined the ranks in formidable numbers, as Clampitt indicates, in search of masculine validation, adventure, and revenge, but what of Black women? What educational and labor opportunities did Federal occupation, especially in the urban area of Vicksburg, afford to formerly enslaved women of color? That the sexual conditions of Black women changed but little from antebellum slavery (which was a type of militarized occupation itself) to Union occupation surely merits greater in-depth discussion.</p><p>The capture of the Gibraltar of the Confederacy represented a stunning defeat for the struggling southern republic, but it rendered an equally challenging task to the Union occupiers. Federal military occupation represented much more than just militarily held territory where further Confederate military movements could be restricted. The Federal administration of the city attempted to patrol and ""unionize"" the behavior of paroled southern soldiers, recalcitrant Confederate women, and freed slaves. It controlled what churches, schools, theaters, and social events were permitted. It confiscated private property. It regulated markets, trade, material relief, and all printed material. It levied taxes in the city to augment operational costs. It reoriented African Americans in a free world that previously excluded them. It strategically implemented oaths of allegiance and punishments intended to enforce policy decisions. Yet for all its physical and cultural work, the social revolution of occupation failed to alter the hearts of southerners and ultimately contributed to ""forging a Confederate identity for Vicksburg that outlived the Confederacy itself"" (7). Bradley Clampitt's thought-provoking book also indirectly urges historians to re-evaluate how we conceptualize our own work. From the nineteenth century and earlier, to a modern era rife with physical and digital wars, historians must acknowledge that social history and military history are at every moment closely aligned. Exploring how militarized societies operate will broaden the conventional limits of cultural, social, and labor history and provide more in depth answers about how modern America still functions using the engine of war and armed occupation.</p><p><i>J.

6617	9780199735815	$35.00	The Republic for Which It Stands: The United States during Reconstruction and the Gilded Age, 1865-1896		White, Richard			"The Gilded Age Revised?<p>""Historians often write of Reconstruction and the Gilded Age as if they were separate and consecutive eras,"" Richard White declares near the beginning of <i>The Republic for Which It Stands: The United States during Reconstruction and the Gilded Age, 1865-1896</i>, ""but the two gestated together"" (2).  With this frank statement behind him, White then leads readers on a journey through the crucial, though too often bypassed, years of the late nineteenth century.  It is a journey both disorienting and familiar given recent observations that we may be living in a second Gilded Age in the early twenty-first century.  While White is circumspect about making comparisons with our own time, it is impossible to push the legacy of our own time completely out of frame.  This produces an odd effect where the sum of the book's parts seems greater when one is working one's way through the tome.  This is particularly true for readers primarily interested in the Civil War and Reconstruction, who are likely to have a much different take on the book than the general reader.</p><p>This reviewer imagines that specialists in the study of Reconstruction (it should be noted that the Civil War itself is only the slightest of backdrops to this story) will object on numerous grounds to what White does with the topic.  One thing that seems clear is that the author's reading did not dive very deeply into the recent historiography.  While Eric Foner and Michael Perman still have much to teach us, to lean on them heavily lends a desultory feel to the discussion of Reconstruction.  The list of authors not consulted comprises a veritable who's who in the field; one will search in vain for citations to recent studies by Joan Waugh, Elaine Frantz Parsons, Jason Phillips, Kidada Williams, William Blair, just to name a few.  On one hand, White may not have placed emphasis on the Reconstruction period when he sat down to conceptualize the book--readers of the acknowledgements will notice, for example, that the only scholar in the field who seems to have read the manuscript is David Blight.  On the other hand, this might be a consequence of White's analytical position.  Since the book's arguments about Reconstruction hew closely to the post-revisionist positions first charted in the 1970s, the inclusion of a wide range of recent scholarship may have required more analytical work than White was prepared to devote to Reconstruction.  Be that as it may, it is a disappointment that the generally excellent bibliographic essay found at the end of the book fails to contain a wider sampling of the recent Reconstruction literature.</p>     <p>A larger issue concerning White's approach to Reconstruction involves his interpretation of the Republican Party.  From the first pages of the book, we are informed the fissures within the Republican Party were real and consequential.  This line is constantly repeated throughout the book's 870 plus pages of text; so insistent is White that uninitiated readers might wonder how Republicans accomplished anything at all.  Part of this stance derives from White's read of post-Civil War parties: ""These parties were not particularly ideological,"" White maintains, with party coherence derived from ethnocultural factors (3).  As a result, any time that issues seem salient, White is quick to insist that the issues served as a smokescreen for other agendas.  White's presentation of Republican division, it should be noted, is carried out with practically no discussion of voting behavior in Congress, or the popular vote in national elections.  And, though he smartly carries the discussion of Reconstruction throughout the entire book, he is quick to dismiss any expressions of Republican commitment to voting and/or civil rights as akin to vestigial organ on the body of the party.  To this reviewer, it seemed like White either misreads or reads incompletely the work of scholars like Charles Calhoun, who is cited regularly in the text.  While Calhoun argues that, over the course of the Gilded Age, the displacement of concerns over the civil rights of African Americans with interest in economic issues occurred among the GOP, Calhoun also shows that in the 1880s, the national party made a spirited attempt to win southern states (nearly doing so in several border states), that federal marshals oversaw southern elections in the first part of that decade, and that the Lodge Elections bill of 1890, handled far too briefly by White (see especially 627-30) represents the real transition to a politics centered upon a ""full dinner pail.""  White would have also benefited from an examination of Pamela Brandwein's <i>Rethinking the Judicial Settlement of Reconstruction</i>, a pathbreaking work the revises much of what we think we know about the important Supreme Court cases of the era.</p>      <p>White's final position on Reconstruction will perhaps prove most controversial to students of the subject.  ""Reconstruction was not doomed to fail,"" White asserts, but had failed because of Republican ineptitude (336).  For all of the mistakes made by Republicans, mistakes made in good faith and bad, such a summary judgment underplays the centrality of white southern opposition to Reconstruction – or to racism in American society more generally.  Impugning the GOP for not responding more forcefully to white terrorism is completely justified, but to focus one's historical explanation for Reconstruction's shortcoming entirely on the party ignores how racialized structures of power in the south shaped the agency of both whites and blacks in that region.</p>   <p>That said, the contributions of this volume are clear and impressive.  First, White instantiates Elliott West's concept of a ""Greater Reconstruction"" better than anyone else has to date.   White's exposition of the linkages between the Crédit Mobilier scandal, the Freedman's Savings bank, the political economy of railroad development, especially in the south, and national politics during a fraught moment of Reconstruction is simply brilliant (265-66).  So too is his explicit comparison between Radical Republicans and the Indian Peace Commissioners as leading equivalent (and related) nation-building movements (109, 113-17).  In elucidating the contours of the Greater Reconstruction, White suggests two important points: first, one has to do more than invoke the concept, but actually has to draw out distinct and clear points of contact; second, those trained in western history are best positioned to adjudicate claims about a Greater Reconstruction, since they know the scholarly ground best.  Indeed, White's frequent reliance on his 2012 study <i>Railroaded! </i> sometimes tells us just as much about federal aspirations and the limits of the federal prerogative as his coverage of the canonical aspects of Reconstruction.</p><p>Second, the volume is filled with interesting connections and approaches, connections that others may not have made.  What makes White such an interesting choice for a volume like this is that if one were to ask American historians what field they believed White worked in, ""historian of the Gilded Age"" would probably not appear as one of the top five responses.  Simply put, White's body of scholarly work not only reveals a vast collection of topical interests, but it has also transcended hard and fast chronological bounds.  Where White has made his name as a scholar is in the fields of western history, environmental history, and American Indian history, and the sections of <i>The Republic for Which It Stands</i> devoted to those topics are written with verve and insight.  See, for example, his chapter ""Dying for Progress,"" which explores ""a largely urban Gilded Age environmental crisis that people recognized but could neither name nor fully understand,"" or his poignant accounts of those who were eager to displace native societies in the belief that ""rain follows the plow"" (476, 425-39).</p> <p>A particular strength of the book – and one reason why Americanists with a broad teaching mandate will enjoy the book – is White's keen eye for data.  Statistics for lecture abound in <i>The Republic for Which It Stands</i>. While not always pitched as classic social history, the numerous sections in the book devoted to the analysis of data inevitably draw readers back into the prosaic (and often grim) realities of life in the late nineteenth century.  Even hardened veterans of Gilded Age historiography might be taken aback by the fact that New York City cleared 10,000 dead horses from its streets in 1880, or that Gilded Age plutocrats enjoyed dining on birds that frantically fattened themselves when kept in total darkness that were then drowned in brandy, roasted, and eaten whole  (500, 474).  Tellingly, the statistical charts sprinkled throughout the book seem unique among the Oxford series volumes, and they often are based on the most recent publications from other disciplines.  Two highlights are White's discussion of both internal and external migration and their relationship to geographic mobility, and his detailed exposition of the factors that left the citizens of an increasingly prosperous United States shorter, less healthy, and hungrier than Americans in the first half of the nineteenth century.  If one takes a step back from the grinding minutiae of a nearly 900 page book, White's reliance on social science data serves to buttress a major synthetic device of the book, the period concern with family and/or homes (5).  While the family and the home sometimes vanish from the narrative, they remain original and persuasive lenses for understanding the history of this period, particularly in their gendered and racialized incarnations.</p>    <p>Perhaps the best way to encapsulate everything found within the pages of <i>The Republic for Which It Stands</i> is to say that it is a study easier experienced than described.  While White's discussion of Reconstruction is not likely to satisfy specialists in that field (for a variety of reasons), the volume aspires to be something much more than an account of the immediate postwar years.  And, even for the dissatisfied, there is more than enough to draw one back to the book, even if one is only looking for gripping lecture anecdotes.</p><p>Kevin Adams</p><p>Kent State University</p><p><i>The author of </i>Class and Race in the Frontier Army: Military Life in the West, 1870-1890<i>, Kevin Adams specializes in the intersections between the military and society during the Gilded Age and is a former Associate Editor of </i>Civil War History<i>.</i></p>"	Adams, Kevin	Winter 2018	2018-2-1	Review			Oxford		Politics;Reference;Social_History			"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=243 alt=\""Product Cover\"" border=0 src=\""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/republicwhite.jpg\"">"							
6560	674737555	$39.95	Indians in the Family: Adoption and the Politics of Antebellum Expansion		Peterson, Dawn			"The Hazards of Benevolence and the Politics of Adoption in the Early Republic<p>In 1813, Andrew Jackson wrote home to his wife informing her that in the midst of a bloody military campaign against the Creeks he had been moved to pity by the plight of a young Creek orphan whom he was sending on to join their household. While Jackson's pivot from brutal commander to sympathetic patriarch might at first glance seem surprising, Dawn Peterson reveals the interdependence of these roles by locating Jackson's actions within a larger history of Indian adoption in the early national era. Peterson argues that white adoption of Indian youths was a critical tool in the process of U.S. territorial expansion and the cultivation of racial slavery in the region that would become the Deep South. Yet, as Peterson demonstrates, these adoptions were contingent upon Native support. She mines a rich archive to investigate the motivations and visions of indigenous parents and leaders, arguing that they looked to adoption as a ""strategy of infiltration"" that helped some nations challenge American incursions, at least for a time. </p> <p><i>Indians in the Family</i> is both a nuanced history of the lives of Choctaw, Creek, and Chickasaw youths adopted into white households between the 1790s and the 1830s and an incisive investigation of Native politics and American expansion. While later in the nineteenth century the removal of Indian children from their families and the removal of indigenous peoples from their lands served as paired strategies of dispossession, Peterson argues that the volatile politics of the early national era made adoption a valuable strategy both for American expansionists and Native resisters. By putting adoption at the center of this history of U.S. antebellum expansion, Peterson succeeds in integrating the intimate politics of household organization into the history of nation building and empire. Peterson defines adoption expansively, as ""an array of practices focused on the assimilation of Indian youths . . .."" (p. 3) This approach enables her to contextualize her careful reconstruction of the paths individual Indian youths followed in and out of white households within a larger examination of struggles over the place of Native peoples within the American body politic.</p> <p>Across nine chapters, Peterson examines the shifting politics of Indian adoption beginning with Thomas Jefferson's national vision and concluding with Indian removal. For Jefferson, adoption fit into a larger vision of ""reproductive philanthropy"" that promoted the integration of Indians into the modern economy as a means of saving them from demographic collapse while simultaneously opening Native lands to American settlers. For Native peoples, the patriot victory in the American Revolution curtailed possibilities for transnational alliances and, consequently, made adoption a more valuable strategy in efforts to protect territory and sovereignty in the face of American aggression. In this context, experiments in sending Indian children into white households and schools outside Native territories proliferated. Some adoptees became important representatives of Native interests in negotiations with American political and economic powerbrokers. For example, Mary Doxtater, who left the Oneida territories to live with Quakers in Chester County, Pennsylvania, went on to open schools and serve as an attorney for the Stockbridge Nation in its negotiations with the state of New York.</p> <p>Peterson's attention to adoption's multiple political registers reveals its importance in the struggles between sovereign nations but also within individual lives. For example, deep contextualization enables Peterson to reconstruct the decision of Molly McDonald, a Choctaw woman, to place her son with Silas Dinsmoor, an Indian agent. In so doing, Peterson makes a compelling argument for women's importance in shaping how Native communities confronted encroaching American settlers and the system of racialized slavery they brought with them. Just as McDonald looked to placing her son in Dinsmoor's household as a strategy that would help her navigate the volatile politics of the Choctaw nation in the early nineteenth century, Dinsmoor pursued adoption in hopes of improving his own career. Similarly, Peterson argues Andrew Jackson adopted Lyncoya, the young Creek orphan, to shore up his place within his household and his son's affections at the same time his action lent a benevolent cast to a violent war. Peterson demonstrates that the personal was political for all parties in these experiments in assimilation.</p><p>Jackson's embrace of adoption was short-lived, however. By the 1830s he argued that the very cultural knowledge and social connections that were the objective of adoption had made former adoptees illegitimate representatives of Indian nations in treaty negotiations. The career of James McDonald, Molly McDonald's son, who grew up as the ward of American elites and returned home to serve as a Choctaw diplomat, reveals the costs and limitations of the adoption strategy. His cultural and legal knowledge helped him secure his family's claims to land and enslaved property, but did not prevent Choctaw dispossession. He, and his nation, suffered as a thoroughly racialized understanding of identity and citizenship eclipsed the negotiated vision of assimilation.</p> <p><i>Indians in the Family</i> is an analytically ambitious book that begins from the premise that gender, indigenous agency, and racialization are essential to understanding the politics of American early national expansion and the entrenchment of racial slavery. The book balances its analytical rigor with attention to human subjectivity and how it shaped historical action. While Peterson's broad definition of adoption enables the book to connect disparate stories, it also leaves questions about the politics attending varied modes of child circulation for other scholars to explore. Peterson acknowledges that these elite experiments in adoption were relatively rare, but other kinds of child circulation moved many children across national and racial boundaries in this period. Examining those stories and their relationships to the rich history Peterson has presented here would afford further insight into the political value of cultural knowledge and children's prominence in creating it during the early decades of the nation's history.</p> <p><i>Catherine Jones is an associate professor of history at University of California, Santa Cruz.

6559	1107105277	$99.99	Institutional Slavery: Slaveholding Churches, Schools, Colleges, and Businesses in Virginia, 1680-1860		Oast, Jennifer			"The Institutions of a Slave Society	<p>In the summer of 1835, it came to the attention of the University of Virginia's Board of Visitors that a slave was living in the Rotunda. The university owned or rented several slaves, one of whom had evidently decided to settle in a room near the chemistry lab. The Board insisted that the man move out and that the room be ""properly cleansed,""locked up, or put to other desirable uses"" (178). The building, Jennifer Oast argues, was thought to be too central to the landscape of the university, too closely identified with it, for a slave to use any part of it as his living quarters. The Rotunda appears on the cover of Oast's <i>Institutional Slavery</i> as a signifier of the churches, businesses, and colleges of Virginia that were deeply invested and implicated in slavery. The building has also, of course, been bathed in torchlight recently, in media images of white supremacists shouting violent slogans at student protestors. Often cited as an architectural gem, the Rotunda is a physical reminder of the pervasiveness of slavery and the difficulty of grappling with and eradicating its legacies.</p> <p>Oast's book is an invaluable text in illustrating how slavery dug itself so deeply into American life. She tackles what she terms institutional slavery, the plight of human beings in bondage, whether owned or hired, to ""a group of people united in a common purpose -- nonprofit educational and religious organizations, the public (as organized into state government), and for-profit companies"" (3). These slaves labored for such institutions, or they were hired out to swell endowments and operating budgets. Oast's work details the often-overlooked stories of these people, and it presents a clearly-argued double-pronged thesis: that institutional slavery expanded the circle of beneficiaries of bondage and enhanced its power; and that, while slaveholders defended themselves with assertions of their paternalism, they regularly violated its tenets in the service of philanthropic generosity to white communities. The success of charitable endeavors in the South was also the history of the exploitation of slaves. ""From its earliest years,"" Oast establishes, ""the leaders of Virginia yoked educational philanthropy to bound labor"" (126). Oast's work paints a finely-textured picture of the reality of what Ira Berlin termed a slave society, a society in which slavery dictated relationships of every degree of power and intimacy.</p>	<p>As Oast points out, we need more monographic studies that tackle the varying experiences of enslaved people; depicting the realities of their lives should enhance rather than diminish the gravity of the moral reckoning we must make with this history. Her regular references to Jonathan Martin's <i>Divided Mastery</i> in the footnotes parallel my own experience of the relative paucity of scholarship on regular practices like the hiring of slaves. Oast faithfully traces the consequences of institutional bondage for those who lived in it. While some people who lived and worked in college or university settings managed to attain literacy or to facilitate communication with family members sold away, others experienced the dangers of annual hiring, which might mean violence, malnutrition, separation from family, and other attendant horrors. Oast traces demographically the potentially lethal dangers of this constant hiring. Particularly striking is Oast's documentation of the premium placed on the purchase of young women for institutions, since they would be able to reproduce human capital. She follows communities of slaves seemingly connected through generations back to a few founding mothers (63-5). Using close readings of records, she compellingly reconstructs the ways in which slaves found themselves caught between representatives of the institutions that owned or hired them in battles of authority (139-40). Her examination of the roles of slaves in colleges and universities offers a useful complement to Daina Ramey Berry's <i>The Price for Their Pound of Flesh</i>, which follows the lives of slaves who acquired the corpses of black people as research subjects for early medical schools. The man who lived in the Rotunda had apparently selected his room for its proximity to science classrooms and workspaces, suggesting, Oast points out, that some slaves held positions of skill and responsibility (152, 177). But similar positions came with demands that slaves serve as emissaries into the world of the dead, where black corpses were valuable commodities.</p>	<p>The idea that inequality would continue after death was perfectly logical in the society that Oast brings to life. Her well-documented study of one particular aspect of the slave-holding South should illuminate the workings and assumptions of a culture that was so deeply committed to the tenets of human bondage that its primacy touched every part of daily life. Her study of slaves hired into industries like mining and manufacturing joins other significant work on the topic and expands our understanding of this facet of slave experience. But her work on educational and religious institutions viscerally demonstrates just how deeply entrenched human bondage was in the antebellum South. The board of trustees at Hollins College, she points out, considered altering the school calendar to have the long break over the winter, so that conducting classes would not conflict with the annual period for slave hiring (194). Oast points out that this proposal was aired in 1863, after the Emancipation Proclamation was issued. A world without slaves, a world in which slavery was not the central fact around which all else revolved, seemed impossible even then. Slaves kept Virginia's educational and religious institutions functioning, a reality that Oast describes poignantly. But their labor also funded the philanthropic missions of the organizations that owned them. The circles of people who did not themselves hold slaves but who benefitted from slavery thus expanded. Planters and manufacturers who were able to exploit a readily available labor pool of slaves for hire, poor white families who bid for the chance to take care of elderly institutional slaves, hoping to profit by spending less on upkeep than they were paid, poor white students who attended school on scholarships funded with endowments generated by slave labor -- all these people benefitted. All of them were invested in slavery. And all of their advantages were bought with the pain and fear of human beings. One Hampden-Sydney student, typical of young white university men trying out their power as potential masters, wrote to his sister that he felt ""like killing"" every time he saw one of the college slaves (173). Many church and school officials, Oast argues, were invested in their vision of themselves as paternalists, and a minority of them expressed concern at the dangers slaves faced when confronted with people like the student. More frequent were those like the Reverend Samuel Gray, who expressed his own unconflicted version of paternalism after he had beaten his slave Jack to death: what had happened was ""unfortunate Chance which I would not Should have happened in my family for three times his price""but it is past Cure and such Accidents will happen now and then"" (31).</p>	<p>In her discussion of William and Mary, Oast notes that she is depicting the environment in which Thomas Roderick Dew and other proslavery intellectuals worked. These are the people and circumstances they saw every day. These kinds of connections between how white Southerners justified and explained and understood the world they lived in and how black Southerners endured and built lives and communities in bondage are invaluable. This book helps shed light on how deep those connections ran and reinforces our moral obligation to examine them and their ongoing legacies.</p><p><i>Katherine Mooney is assistant professor of history at Florida State University and author of</i> Race Horse Men: How Slavery and Freedom Were Made at the Racetrack<i> (Harvard, 2014).</i></p>"	Mooney, Katherine	Fall 2017	2017-11-1	Review			Cambridge University Press		Front_Center;Politics;Slavery			"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=245 alt=\""Product Cover\"" border=0 src=\""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/oastinstitutionalslavery.jpg\"">"							
6358	9780881465457	$35.00	In His Own Words: Houston Hartsfield Holloway\'s Slavery, Emancipation, and Ministry in Georgia		Holloway, Houston H.	Paterson, David E		"The Life and Times of Houston Holloway Recovered<p>This work adds another important volume to the corpus of historical literature that offer first-hand accounts of African Americans both during and after slavery in the American South.   With the meticulous research and editorial care of David E. Paterson, a civilian U.S. Navy employee -- turned public historian, it pulls together an almost full autobiography of Houston Hartsfield Holloway, a former slave of Meriwether County, Georgia.  Provided in the span of seven chapters is a rare glimpse into the life, activities and recollections of a man whose evolution moved him from pre-Civil War skilled blacksmith to post-War AME Church (African Methodist Episcopal) preacher.  Holloway was born on a plantation in Upson County, Georgia in 1844, became a free man at the close of the Civil War in 1865, began preaching in 1866, and died in 1917 at the age of 73. </p><p>The narratives and autobiographies of former enslaved African Americans cover a broad spectrum. They range from those that are excellent and deemed invaluable, to those that are of marginal value, and to others that are entirely fanciful and devoid of all discerning historical merit.  As a slave source, <i>In His Own Words</i>, falls somewhere in the middle of autobiographies that provide details on the life and times of former enslaved African Americans.  Four of seven chapters are devoted entirely to Holloway's life as a slave and treat many of the basic topics, including family and childhood, work, religion, recreation, and the deportment of slaveholders and slaves during the closing years of the Civil War.  A slightly uncommon and very brief chapter is one titled, ""Conjure Men and Marriage.""   The details here are not novel, of course, and focus largely on the beliefs held by enslaved men, such as Holloway, who believed that conjurors had the power to change and influence their romantic lives.  This chapter, unfortunately, like a few others in the original manuscript, was never completed by Holloway himself.  In fact, what editor Paterson makes clear is that even the document itself was never completed by Holloway and was not initially prepared for publication.  Instead, it was one of those rare items found at the Library of Congress where it had been ""donated"" by ""Holloway's descendants"" in 1978.  In this regard, consequently, the present book should perhaps be examined alongside the late historian John W. Blassingame's 1977 edited collection of <i>Slave Testimony: Two Centuries of Letters, Speeches, Interviews, and Autobiographies</i>.  All of these sources, for example, throw light on the varied experiences of enslaved African Americans, and allow others, in the specific words of Blassingame, ""to determine the reliability of each, and to analyze the complex black response to bondage.""  (p. xi) </p><p>Surprisingly, what readers will find in almost unprecedented and unique fashion in the current book is a double package -- literally two books in one.   For example, the editor has not only made public a rare manuscript that had languished unread for almost a century, but through his own extensive research and exhaustive editing actually written another book. The latter consist of his copious notes found on essentially every page of <i>In His Own Words</i>, the abundant supplementary information in the form of appendixes, photos, and the carefully prepared genealogical illustrations on Holloway and his family. In fact, what was literally an almost incoherent and disjointed manuscript is now available in book form for readers to examine and determine for themselves if Holloway's story rings true, or if it indeed warrants the attention that Holloway himself believed set him apart from his fellows, both before and after the death of slavery in Georgia. </p> <p>While hardly the stuff of legend, the information presented on Holloway's life as a preacher, both by himself and the editor, may be most valuable to those interested in the religious life of African Americans in post Civil-War Georgia.  Chapter 6, ""Preaching and Working,"" lays bare Holloway's interaction with black and white Methodists in and around the counties of Meriwether, Campbell, Coweta, Pike, Upson, Monroe, Fayette, and Putnam for a period of seventeen years.  Two maps are included that show both the geographical boundaries of ""Holloway's Neighborhoods"" from 1844 to 1870, and his ""Ministry"" between 1866 and 1883.   From church association minutes and the memoirs and writings of other church leaders, the editor has clarified names that appear garbled in Holloway's own manuscript, and also added others that reveal the connecting web of churches and leaders that comprised the world in which this former slave and post-Civil War preacher moved and worked.  In sum, according to editor Paterson, ""Holloway's Autobiography is a rare look at nineteenth-century African Methodism in Georgia.""  (p.2). </p><p>Overall, editor and author, David E. Paterson, deserve high praise and applauds for making available the story of yet another African American who made the transition \""from slavery to freedom.\""</p><p><i>David C.

6393	9781479806997	$30.00	Undisciplined: Science, Ethnography, and Personhood in the Americas, 1830-1940		Farooq, Nihad			"The Long Darwinian Nineteenth Century<p>Over the course of the nineteenth century ""personhood,"" how to exactly to define a person and fitting them into the evolving social fabric, became a hotly contested problem. Constructing personhood served a critically important function in governance, expanding colonialism, and the rise of the modern nation state. Defining personhood worked to identify belonging in societies at the crest of the colonial era in global history. The problem became especially central in the discourse surrounding slavery and emancipation in the Western Hemisphere. A new book, <i>Undisciplined: Science, Ethnography, and Personhood in the Americas, 1830-1940</i> by Nihad M. Farooq takes a closer look into a critical century in the evolution of thinking about personhood and citizenship as it developed alongside the rise of the social sciences. Scientific narratives, she argues, shed valuable light on the nebulous understanding of personhood. Tracking the emergence of Darwinian thinking alongside the birth of new approaches to social science like ethnography during the height of global nationalism results in struggles over how individuals fit into larger groups.</p>   <p>Farooq, an Associate Professor of American & Atlantic Studies at the Georgia Institute of Technology, argues in this work that the Darwinian moment maintained a deeper and more complex influence on both the emergent sciences and literature in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries than is commonly recognized in the literature. Darwin's journey to Tierra del Fuego and his interactions with the Natives there provide the jumping off point for the book. Farooq's attention then turns to Louis Aggasiz's efforts in photography in Brazil, Zora Neal Hurston's work in Jamaica, and finally, Katherine Dunham's (and others') efforts to better understand the island nation of Haiti. The book is published as part of NYU's America in the Long 19th Century series. Reflecting this emphasis, the work touches on developments on either end of the closing years in the nineteenth century and thereby expands our knowledge on the question of personhood by illustrating the developments on either side of the key moment in the chronology.</p><p>While not dismissing the difficult reputations of many of the thinkers described in this book, the author is clearly interested in moving beyond critique lobbied in their direction in recent years. Farooq's weaving in the stories of William James, Agassiz, Melville Herskovits, Franz Boas, Claude McKay, Hurston, and Langston Hughes provide interesting insights into their work in building up (and breaking down) modern academic disciplines.</p>    <p>This provocative book argues the expansion of the human biological and social sciences in the nineteenth century should be read less as an aggressive colonial experience and more of a Darwinian-inspired model of continual adaptation. During this same era, anthropology, sociology, linguistics, geography, and a host of other sciences were coming into their own through the establishment of discursive networks engaging in both publication and correspondence to debate new ideas. Gradually, a host of professional organizations began emerging, based mainly in major cities and universities throughout Europe and the United States. Although debated across the landscape of ideas in the nineteenth and early twentieth century, notions about what it meant to be a person, belong to a society, and construct a family remained central and vibrant in intellectual and legal discourse, often sparked through the cross-cultural interactions experienced by scientific expedition and other exploration.</p><p>Combining the result of archival research with Farooq's reading of secondary literature, the book heavily emphasizes a literary criticism perspective while working to contextualize material historically. Though a remarkably fascinating read, this book is ambitious, perhaps overly so. Over the space of an introduction, four chapters, and a brief conclusion the monograph takes on major debates in intellectual history, philosophy, literary studies, and the history of anthropology. The book moves between different regions of the globe -- from the seemingly distant and exotic (at least from the perspective of Western science) to the major urban centers where new anthropological societies encouraged the field to grow and move forward. The mixture of narratives is weaved together well throughout most of the book, but at points the story can become somewhat muddled and confusing. This weakness, however, also represents a strength in the project in its ambition and insights in tying together many seemingly disparate topics around the question of personhood. Expeditions, travel, and cross cultural encounters loomed large in the development of the sciences in Europe and the United States, and much of Farooq's book is devoted to narrating examples of these incidents.</p> <p>The book benefits from a handful of carefully selected illustrations. This work would serve as a worthwhile addition to courses or reading lists on the history of science, anthropology, literature, and citizenship in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.</p><p><i>Samuel J.

6405	9780823270118	$125.00	Educational Reconstruction: African American Schools in the Urban South, 1865-1890		Green, Hilary			"The Long Fight for African American Education after the Civil War<p><i>Educational Reconstruction: African American Schools in the Urban South, 1865-1890</i> offers the serious student of education history a compelling study of education policy and activism in two Southern cities. Green positions her book as a needed intervention for a subfield dominated with attention to rural education.  Adding to robust extant scholarship in this area, Green contributes nuanced documentation of the school-building projects by African Americans in the urban South that were already well underway when the Northern missionary and benevolent associations entered the South. Green joins an accomplished cadre of scholars  - from Charles Holt and Jacqueline Jones to Steven Hahn - who emphasize the active role played by African American civic and religious groups for equal rights, and the independent mobilization for public schools that preceded the well-worn story of heroic white missionaries. The book endeavors to extend the chronology of Reconstruction beyond the Compromise of 1877 and move the tombstone to 1890 when Congress failed to pass the Blair Bill.  Green's book contributes more, however, than just a shift from rural to urban or a change in historiographical chronology. <i>Educational Reconstruction</i> demonstrates the complex political negotiations between civic and religious groups, political parties, and the paradoxical relationship of federal, state and voluntary actors. The research design focuses attention to the level of municipalities and their relationship to federal education policy.  <p>The book is at its strongest in chronicling fascinating discussions of African Americans' mobilization to secure federal funding through the Blair Bill. Representative Henry Blair (R-NH) sponsored a bill to promote federal education by allocating 77$ million dollars to states proportionate to state-level illiteracy rates.  The bill passed the Republican-controlled Senate three times during the 1880s but ultimately failed in 1890. Counter to overplayed claims that a ""weak"" American state necessarily doomed federal Reconstruction efforts, the history of the Blair Bill provides a puzzling counterfactual. Green reminds us of the tremendous importance of the 1880s -- an era far too often overlooked in the historiography of Reconstruction. <p>As many reconstruction-era leaders argued, schools had the potential to transform how white Americans viewed African Americans in the wake of emancipation. Green suggests that political alliances with Democrats shifted the symbolic status of African American school children. As evidence, Green describes a change in journalists practice of only labeling white public schools as ""our schools"" but as Freedmen's Bureau funding eroded, journalists began to use this inclusive term to describe commencement activities at public schools educating African American children (p.111). Green's emphasis, however, is less on how Africans were received by whites and instead focuses her attention on the advocacy work of African Americans endeavoring to secure equal educational opportunity. <p>The comparison between Mobile and Richmond documents that while activists in Richmond to push doggedly for equal school funding while whites in Mobile were legally able to disproportionately fund public education for white children. The weakness of the book is that the comparative case design could have been leveraged with greater precision to articulate causal mechanisms for variation between the two port cities.  <p>Green brings the reader into the daily work of education advocates in Mobile and Richmond with rich historical detail. The great strength of <i>Educational Reconstruction</i> is in the rich and complex narratives it illuminates rather than topical or theoretical innovation. <p><i>Christi Smith is a visiting assistant professor of Sociology at Oberlin College.</i></p>"	Smith, Christi	Winter 2017	2017-2-1	Review			Fordham University Press		Politics;Reconstruction;Social_History			"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=241 alt=\""Product Cover\"" border=0 src=\""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/greeneducationalreconstructionf.jpg\"">"							
6411	9780806155623	$29.95	Sweet Freedom's Plains: African Americans on the Overland Trails, 1841-1869		Moore, Shirley Ann Wilson			"The Long Trail to Freedom<p>Over 500,000 Americans went west on the Oregon, California, and Mormon Trails between 1841 and 1869. And although popular representations of these westering folks would have you believe otherwise, not all were of European background. Enslaved African Americans and free blacks also made the overland journey; perhaps as many as 15,000 took to the trails, although their exact numbers will probably never be known.  As Shirley Ann Wilson Moore elegantly shows in her new study, placing the experience of African Americans at the center of a study of western emigration requires a ""reconceptualization of the emigrant narrative."" (5) This reconceptualization is long overdue and with this work Moore has made a significant and vital intervention in western history and U.S. history as a whole.</p>	<p>In order to understand why and how African Americans made the journey west, we must first appreciate the conditions under which black men and women toiled in the nineteenth century. With broad strokes, Moore paints a picture of black life in the antebellum U.S. Slavery, black codes, violence, and punishment constricted black lives whether they lived in Texas, Kentucky, or Tennessee.  For slaves and free blacks, there were ample reasons to inspire the trek overland.  Occasionally, the desire to convey the similarities of overlanders leads Moore to collapse differences between and among African Americans.  For example, she states, ""African Americans who headed west on the overland trails, free or enslaved, did so for similar reasons"" All made their way with caution, acutely aware of the conditions surrounding them yet with an abiding conviction that their lives would be changed for the better once they stepped out on the trail."" (53) Presumably, black travelers had different goals and expectations when they headed west as overlanders, and not all may have greeted the move with such enthusiasm. This is a small grievance, however, as Moore herself gives ample evidence throughout the text of the diversity of black overlanders.</p>  <p>Scholars of African American history will find much to admire in <i>Sweet Freedom's Plains</i>. Moore complicates our understanding of the peculiar institution by providing vignettes of slave life that have not been given adequate attention in previous studies. The stories of slaves forced on the Mormon Trail by their owners or those of the slave hunters who patrolled the jumping-off towns along the Missouri River, make for great reading but also remind us of the ways slaves and slavery shaped the overland experience. Indeed, the book is overflowing with examples that enrich our understanding of black life, free and slave. One of the most intriguing stories is that of cartographer T.H. Jefferson, reputedly the eldest son of Sally Hemmings and Thomas Jefferson, who, in 1849, published a detailed map and guide of the California Trail. A champion of western emigration, Jefferson offered the traveler meticulous descriptions of the flora and fauna as well as practical advice to assist the uninitiated or ""greenhorn.""</p>  <p>The overland journey could be dangerous but it was always laborious. Moore provides fascinating accounts of the ways in which  African Americans ""shouldered the daily work of the trails."" (122). This meant that slave and free, men and women, drove oxen, herded cattle and sheep, hunted for game, hauled heavy cargo on their backs, and cooked the meals that sustained the overlanders. This work could mean the difference between a party that survived the trail and one that did not.  In a particularly insightful chapter, ""Life, Death, and Acts of Kindness,"" Moore confronts the issue of violence on the trails. Contrary to the lurid tales told by newspapers and fear mongers, the number of Indians killed by emigrants was higher than the number of emigrants killed by Native Americans. Between 1840 and 1860, 462 Native Americans died at the hands of emigrants and 362 emigrants were killed by Natives on the overland trails. (131) As this chapter makes clear, African Americans harbored anti-Indian sentiments just as white emigrants did, and some became accomplished  ""Indian fighters.""  It is refreshing to find such a forthright discussion of these conflicts.</p>  <p>One of the most significant contributions of <i>Sweet Freedom's Plains</i> is its discussion of slave agency. The reader gains a new appreciation of the intricate and obstacle-strewn path many slaves took to freedom. The story of Howard Estes, is but one example. Estes,  a Missouri slave, is offered an opportunity to buy himself from his owner for $1000 if he will drive a herd of cattle from Missouri to California.  Estes earned the price of his freedom papers in the California goldfields only to have his master renege on the deal after receiving the money. He spends years working to buy himself, and his wife and children who he had left behind in Missouri. Stories like these remind us that the trails themselves did not always lead to freedom; the journey to manumission could continue long after black overlanders reached their destination, even if they landed in a free state.</p><p>Moore also includes the stories of slave women who traveled the trails, many of whom would set up businesses in the West after they earned their freedom.  Those unfamiliar with the story of the midwife and philanthropist, Biddy Mason, will be fascinated by her convoluted road to freedom. Forced on the trail from Salt Lake City to California by her Mormon master Robert Smith in 1851, Mason gathered vital intelligence about the possibility of freedom in California from a black teamster she met on the trail. Smith, however, had plans to keep Mason and his other slaves in bondage until he could sequester them to Texas where their status as slaves would be more secure. Mason finally earned her freedom in California courts in 1856, after horse and mule trader Robert Owens, and other African American Angelenos, tipped off local sheriffs that Smith had hidden Mason and his other slaves  in the Santa Monica Mountains. The history of the trails is much richer here given Moore's attention to gender.</p>  <p>A tremendous amount of careful research provides the foundation of this book. Moore consulted an impressive array of diaries, letters, journals, maps, and western reminiscences, in addition to conducting her own oral histories with the descendants of black overlanders. The expansive bibliography is a fantastic resource for anyone interested in exploring this topic further. Moore's  attention to such a diverse array of sources allows her to weave a complex narrative and move overland history far beyond the simple stories of a few well-known pioneers.</p> <p><i>Lynn M.

Kelso led an unusual and tumultuous life:  Methodist minister, later atheist, schoolteacher, enlisted man, spy, cavalry officer, master of hairbreadth escapes, and finally writer.  This three-times married, bookish, opinionated, intrepid, and volatile man is a character perhaps worthy of a movie script, and thanks to the expert editing of Christopher Grasso, readers can enjoy and learn from the Civil War-related portions of a much larger autobiography.</p>	<p>In the genre of Civil War memoirs, <i>Bloody Engagements</i> stands out for its forceful language, evocative descriptions, and often slashing commentary.  It focuses on John Kelso's service in Missouri and Arkansas with a home guard outfit, then with the 24th Missouri Volunteer Infantry, and later in the Missouri State Militia Cavalry.  In 1882, Kelso began writing a very lengthy autobiography--in fact the section on the Civil War era published here begins on page 708 of the manuscript.  From the outset, Kelso jumps into his subject with a passion.  ""Mild men became fierce, and fierce men became almost fiendish,"" was his vivid recollection of the immediate reaction to secession.  People of all classes and occupations, women and children, all became caught up in the frenzied excitement, and a religious element only added to the blood lust.  Kelso himself was a fanatical Unionist who from the outset boldly and publicly denounced secession as treason; not an especially modest fellow, he noted how his brave stance (and continuous baiting of secessionist neighbors) caused his status to rise with other men and loyal people more generally.</p>	<p>Kelso apparently impressed his superiors with his dedication and fearlessness, eventually advancing to the rank of major.  Spying and other irregular missions were his forte.  Sometimes he had to pretend to be a loyal Confederate, even to the point of giving a proslavery speech.  He recounts a number of verbatim and occasionally lengthy conversations, an always rather suspect feature in a memoir, but there is no denying Kelso has a certain talent for spinning a tale with dramatic flair.  In the fall of 1861, his own house was burned down by Confederate troops, and he soon managed to wreak vengeance on them in Buffalo, Missouri.  He writes movingly of refugees trudging through snow and, after describing their plight, questions whether God is present in such a situation and rails against the spectacle of supposed Christians slaughtering each other.  During various campaigns and missions, Kelso was often away from home and his second wife apparently had an adulterous affair with a smooth-talking doctor, though the couple did not finally divorce until nearly a decade after the war.</p>  <p>Aside from commenting on his own travails and the general horrors of both conventional and guerrilla warfare, Kelso offers detailed accounts of several skirmishes along with stinging commentary on the derelictions of certain officers.  In any early 1863 fight at Springfield, Missouri, he lay among the wounded to overhear Confederate plans, played dead in a cart that was hauling away bodies, and barely managed to elude watchful rebel guards.  Kelso describes some destructive Union forays into Arkansas, though he generally distances himself from any mistreatment of civilians.  He has little good to say about any Confederates, including women whom he almost always describes as ""coarse.""</p>  <p>Indeed, his hatred of the enemy often appears unremitting, and this carried over into his political career.  In 1864 running as an ""independent Republican,"" he won a tight and disputed congressional race during which he reveled in undoubtedly embellished tales of having slain twenty or more rebel ""bushwhackers.""  Once in office, he joined the radical faction in the House and was one of the earliest proponents for impeaching President Andrew Johnson.  Two postwar speeches that Grasso includes as appendices reveal a man still denouncing rebels in the most bitter terms, abandoning his earlier support for colonizing African Americans, pushing for black suffrage, and ridiculing fears of miscegenation.  Serving but one term in Congress, Kelso eventually moved to California where he remained an outspoken radical and atheist.  Disillusioned with the results of the Civil War, toward the end of his life, he expressed deep regret over his service.  When he died in 1892 he left behind an incomplete work, ""Government Analyzed"" that claimed the war had not improved the lot of African Americans and that the Union had not been worth saving.</p><p><i>Bloody Engagements</i> presents a life filled with drama, conflict, and no little sadness; its often breakneck pace and pungent observations make for lively reading.   Grasso's fine introduction, superb editing, helpful chronology, and useful index greatly add to the value of John Kelso's memoir for researchers and general readers alike.</p><p><i>University of Alabama, Emeritus                George C.

6360			FIGHTING THE CIVIL WAR IN THE CLASSROOM:  Reconstruction		Sheila Sundar			"The Necessary Complexity of Reconstruction<p> I.</p><p> Ashley Cowart was the type of student for whom teachers, particularly the unexperienced Teach For America set that descended upon New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in his elementary years, had little capacity and energy. In 4th grade he began questioning his teachers' decisions to emphasize slavery year after year. ""They just wrote me off as a kid. They said, 'because it's important'. Nobody really responded, and it frustrated me."" Now in 12th grade, he has the perspective to frame his elementary-aged concern more fully. ""We studied slavery all the time, as though that was the full African American history. Every year, it's black history month, and slavery, and then a bit of the civil rights movement.  But we never study actual black history."" </p><p> The curriculum on which Ashley was reared reflects remarkable cohesion amongst teachers across ideological lines. We disagree on testing, school funding, and the nuances of history curriculum. Yet we are willing, regardless of our heritage or political leanings, to teach the events of historical consensus. Blurrier, and less present in American classrooms are the periods in history that remain open and ambiguous, and that set the stage for centuries of debate over democracy, citizenship, and race. </p><p> Historian Eric Foner describes Reconstruction as America's unfinished revolution -- introducing and undermining progress, advancing legal equality yet choking real political, social, and economic advancement through a complex tangle of state laws, terrorism, and propaganda. Reconstruction forced America to look at questions of democracy, citizenship and power through the lens of race. Answers to these questions, with which we continue to grapple, might lie in its analysis. </p><p> If history educators teach only moral absolutes, reducing African American history to key chapters of slavery and Jim Crow, we ignore enormous contribution and complex debate. If we pause on the events and contradictions of Reconstruction, other history comes into focus:  the role of the Freedmen's Bureau and black churches in establishing Historically Black Colleges and Universities, the brief yet powerful rise of black political participation, the differing arguments on race and social progress that parallel contemporary sociological debates. This is the stuff of struggle, and also contribution. </p><p> II. </p><p> Ashley Cowart's high school, New Orleans Charter Math and Science High School is an open admission school serving students throughout the city.  80% of the student body identifies as African American, and the remainder of students are divided evenly amongst those identifying as White, Hispanic, Native American and Asian-American.  Nearly 90% of students qualify for free and reduced lunch.  Discussions in civics classes center around such subjects as mass incarceration and voting rights, infused with a belief that American is a place of promise and also great want. The social studies curriculum is rich with discussion of America's historical contradictions. Required reading in humanities courses includes <i>A People's History of the United States</i>, <i>The New Jim Crow</i>, and <i>Between the World and Me</i>. In 12th grade English, students read Mississippi writer Jesmyn Ward's breathtaking memoir, <i>Men we Reaped</i>, and discuss the transgenerational trauma of the American South. All of these stem from the complex foundation of Reconstruction, readings attempting to answer the questions left open in the late 1800s. </p> <p> But still, students argue, we fall short. </p><p> Ashley Cowart's classmate, Keree Blanks, describes what he calls ""the basics."" ""History, how it's taught now, they only reflect these specific low points and then these major events.  From this time to this time, millions of slaves were transported from Africa. Then the next lesson is right up to the Civil War. And then civil rights.  And you think, 'I think there was a lot of stuff in between.'"" </p><p> ""There's a lot of stuff we don't talk about. Cowart finishes, ""We cover the main broad figures. MLK, Rosa Parks.  But there are people who the general population doesn't know."" </p><p> Their classmate Skyler Prevost echoes this sentiment. ""When you learn about African American history, you only learn about the negative. You don't learn that we brought voodoo to New Orleans. About Congo Square. I do want to understand the brutality of slavery. I also want to know, what did slaves bring over, and how did this influence America?"" </p><p> In order to properly answer these students' questions, we need to begin by reexamining and reteaching Reconstruction. History teachers need to crack open its contradictions, allow students to examine the ways in which American democracy can advance legal rights while simultaneously disenfranchising, how battles are waged and won through every level of civic participation. They need to see how ideas grow and flourish through an unyielding belief in educational advancement, how ideas of people like W.E.B. Dubois and Henry Lyman Morehouse can serve as the foundation of institutions and social movements. </p><p> III. </p><p> In the aftermath of the brutal murders in Charleston, South Carolina, writer Ta-Nehisi Coates published a beautiful reminder of the Confederate Flag's history.  It was not the defiant symbol that rose during the Civil War, as proponents might tell it. It returned to fashion one hundred years later, at the height of the Civil Rights movement, proudly displaying the South's historic allegiance to the racial hierarchies with which we were left at the close of Reconstruction. White Southerners who raised it in the 1960s wanted their 1860s back. </p><p> In response to Coates's column, David French published an article in the <i>National Review</i> reflecting on his own, and that of his generation of Southern white men's, complex relationship with the Confederate Flag.  French argues that the flag should remain in order to acknowledge the difficult truths of history --  a truth in which slavery was built upon ""plunder and pain"" and the identity of the new South, one of Jim Crow laws, lynching, segregation, was a brutal continuation of this unfinished revolution. Yet he argues that when the flag flies over cemeteries and monuments to Confederate war dead, the context shifts its meaning.  It becomes a symbol of history rather than a desire to return to its paradigms. </p><p> It was this paradigm that, as recently as the early 2000s, convinced Ashley Cowart that he would never get close to a white person. All around him were reminders of his country's racial hierarchies -- from the composition of New Orleans neighborhoods to the names of city streets. It was clear who owned America.  ""When I was in middle school I told myself, I'll never be friends with anyone who's white."" High school shifted this perception. The slight increase in his school's diversity played a role, but also a fuller sense of who he was as a person and student. ""Even though I've changed in that way, I still feel angry,"" he says. ""Particularly now, with what's happening in the world.  Sometimes we're treated like African Americans are the cause of slavery, the Civil War, segregation, and all of the tension associated with BLM.  Like we're sparking it, even though we're the ones being killed."" </p><p> Ashley's classmate, Skyler, connects students' changing sense of themselves, and the communities with whom they can meaningfully interact, to the content of their history classrooms. ""If we study the contributions, we're going to think, these people are powerful. If you study only that black people were slaves, then you're going to feel marginalized."" </p><p> Ashley continued, ""I want to know what somebody who was black built. I can say who made the lightbulb. There's people who encouraged slavery but I know their names. I'm struggling to identify the name of the black man who invented the streetcar.  And it's not just me.  If a little white boy learns about black people who invented the things they used every day, he'll see a positive."" </p><p> Reconstruction marked a shift in our national discussion of race and citizenship. Texts that define schools like New Orleans Charter Math and Science High School are founded upon the view that the work of racial equality is as unfinished as the other battles of Reconstruction. Proponents and opponents of the removal of the Confederate Flag rarely sit side by side in a classroom, taking in the arguments that have shaped and divided American since 1877. But perhaps, by allowing for the complexity of history, they can. Perhaps we can build classrooms so empowering that students can grapple with these opposing arguments about race, power, and commemoration. Our students' generation may never finish this revolution. But perhaps our curricular choices can give them the tools to enter it. </p><p><i>Sheila Sundar is the founder and director of the Southern History Project. </i></p>"		Fall 2016	2016-11-1	Classics					Front_Center			"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=107 alt=\""Product Cover\"" border=0 src=\""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/sundarimage1.jpg\"">"							
6417	9780881465624	$35.00	Cracking the Solid South: The Life of John Fletcher Hanson, Father of Georgia Tech		Dunn, Lee C.			"The New South Expanded <p>Conventional wisdom (and history books) tells us that Henry W. Grady was the most outspoken person in favor of post-Civil War industrialization in the South. With Lee C. Dunn's book <i>Cracking the Solid South: The Life of John Fletcher Hanson, Father of Georgia Tech</i> we can now include another Georgian, John Hanson, in that conversation. Born in 1840 in Barnesville, Georgia, not much is known about Hanson's childhood, though Dunn surmises Hanson's education consisted of reading newspapers and the Bible (his father was a minister) and attending the old-field schools. When the Civil War broke out in 1861 Hanson enlisted as a private in the Spalding Grays, which later became part of the 2nd Georgia Battalion. When the 53rd Georgia Infantry Regiment was formed in May 1862 Hanson was commissioned adjutant with the rank of major. For the remainder of his life Hanson was referred to as Major. In this capacity Hanson fought in several major battles in the Virginia theatre of the war, including the Peninsula Campaign, the Seven Days' Battles, Antietam, and Chancellorsville. Just a few days after Chancellorsville, in May 1863, Hanson resigned from the Confederate Army for medical reasons; a surgeon's letter stated he suffered from nephritis and calculus, though years later Hanson claimed chronic bronchitis as the reason he resigned. Whatever the malady, he sat out the rest of the war.</p> <p>It is in the postwar period though that Major Hanson established himself as an advocate for southern industrialization. Dunn describes Hanson as ""an industrialist and visionary,"" and that he ""personified the phoenix who rose from the ashes, becoming a leading Georgia advocate of the New South in the aftermath of the Civil War"" (pg. 2). What perhaps makes Hanson stand out is that he was not just a spokesman for industrialization, he practiced what he preached. At the peak of his career he controlled nine mills that manufactured hosiery, twine, cording, yarn, coarse fabrics, and fine Egyptian cotton fabrics. In addition to his textile interests Hanson founded the Columbus Power Company to generate hydroelectric power and presided over the Central of Georgia Railway and the Ocean Steamship Company (a subsidiary of the railway). Add to that his leadership role in the creation of a technological school in the state, Georgia Institute of Technology, and Hanson surpasses all others in preaching and practicing the New South industrial gospel.</p> <p>Settling in Barnesville after the war, Hanson's entrepreneurial side emerged and he began a furniture enterprise with support and funding from Cyrus Wakefield of Massachusetts. It is significant to note his financial support came from the North, money being largely unavailable in the postwar South. In order to support his growing family Hanson got involved in a brick business and was an agent for the North American Life Insurance Company. In addition, Hanson formed a partnership in 1868 to run a warehouse to store cotton, and formed a similar partnership with his father for the same purpose. Always the hard worker, Dunn states that the Major held seven different jobs in Barnesville. In 1871 Hanson and his family moved to Macon, the heart of the cotton trade in Middle Georgia.</p> <p>Hanson's move to Macon put him in the center of the cotton business in that part of the state and Hanson quickly became a commission merchant; also called cotton factors, merchants bought and sold cotton on commission. In his work as a merchant Hanson discovered an abandoned warehouse, which he purchased in 1876 along with his brother and Hugh Comer, a cotton merchant in Savannah. Their plan to open a textile factory came to fruition on September 15, 1876 with the opening of Bibb Manufacturing. In addition to textiles, Bibb was also a gristmill, though the textile portion of the factory was more profitable and eventually took over the entire property. In short order Hanson and his partners purchased a failing factory out of foreclosure and called it Bibb Mill No.2; the original Bibb premises was called Bibb Mill No. 1. By the fall of 1878 Bibb boasted 220 employees, and in five years (1876-1881) Bibb's value doubled. This was the beginning of Hanson becoming a leader of the postwar industrial movement in Georgia and the South.</p> <p>In 1881 Hanson diversified his business enterprises by purchasing the <i>Macon Telegraph</i> and becoming the managing editor. The <i>Telegraph</i> became an avenue through which Hanson could espouse his belief in industrialization and his desire to fight political corruption. In the latter cause he tangled with Henry Grady, the Atlanta Ring, and Grady's <i>Atlanta Constitution</i>. While both men supported industrialization in the South, their general outlook differed and they disagreed on many political issues of the day. Grady, though forward thinking on the southern economy, tended to look backwards on other issues, such as supporting a one-party system in the South, opposing equality for African Americans, and coming out against tariff reform. Hanson, on the other hand, supported equality for blacks, came out for tariff reform, and endorsed a two-party system in the South. In fact, he became a Republican in the 1880s and supported Benjamin Harrison in the 1888 presidential election (for which he was considered for a cabinet post). For his position on these issues Hanson was branded a heretic in much of the South, which perhaps explains his anonymity to history.</p> <p>Another avenue Hanson pursued in his support of industrialization in Georgia and the South was the creation of a technological school in the state, a cause he championed in the pages of the <i>Telegraph</i>. The Major knew that if Georgia was to be competitive industrially, the state needed an institution to train students in chemical, mechanical, textile, and electrical engineering. Besides, he needed trained foremen for his factories. Hanson began his editorial campaign for this kind of institution in March 1882. A second approach Hanson used was to lobby the state legislature, and his conduit was Macon Representative Nathaniel Harris, who won a seat in the state House in 1882. Through Harris the legislature created a committee to study the issue of technological education in Georgia. The committee visited numerous campuses, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, before recommending the creation of a technological school. For his part, Hanson personally lobbied both houses of the legislature in support of the bill to create this institution. Despite the committee's report and Hanson's efforts, the legislature did not pass the bill. Undaunted, Harris reintroduced the bill in 1885 and the Major continued to lobby the legislature. This time their efforts were rewarded with success, as the bill passed and the governor signed it on October 13, 1885. A year later Atlanta was chosen as the location for the school, and two years after that, on October 5, 1888, the Georgia School of Technology (later Georgia Institute of Technology) held its formal opening. Hanson's role in the creation of Georgia Tech should not be underestimated; a former vice-provost of academic affairs at Georgia Tech wrote this about Hanson: ""More than any other individual, John F. Hanson deserves to be remembered as Georgia Tech's founder and the creator of its tradition of promoting economic development through technological education"" (pg. 104). Hanson is honored on campus with a student dormitory named for him.</p> <p>The creation of Georgia Tech is probably the crowning achievement in John Hanson's career in bringing industry to Georgia and the South. In <i>Cracking the Solid South</i>, Lee Dunn has done for Hanson what the Major did for southern industry. She has made Hanson a recognized figure and provided historians with a more forward thinking alternative to Henry Grady. On the postwar industrialization of Georgia and the South Hanson should now be mentioned equally with Grady. The book is comprehensively researched and put together well with a section of photographs relevant to Hanson. It is a significant contribution to our knowledge of the postwar industrialization movement in Georgia and the South.</p><p>Chris Meyers is Professor of History at Valdosta State University.

6516	9781612348070	$34.95	The Sharpshooters: A History of the Ninth New Jersey Volunteer Infantry in the Civil War		Longacre, Edward			"The Ninth New Jersey Remembered<p>For those inclined to believe that involvement in prominent engagements such as Gettysburg, Antietam/Sharpsburg, Fredericksburg, Vicksburg, or Chickamauga constituted the only meaningful participation in the American Civil War, the members of the Ninth New Jersey Volunteer Infantry, later Veteran Volunteers, would have begged to differ.  Noted for their willingness to engage and capacity to overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles, the ""Jersey Muskrats,"" as they came to be known, saw service in the Carolinas before heading to Virginia in the last full year of the war.  Prominent roles early-on at Roanoke Island and New Bern established a place among the fighting elite in bouts with Confederate defenders of coastal North Carolina in 1862.  Yet, duties there could be mundane and frustrating between the exhilarating moments of contact, as men from the command guarded railroads, mounted extended scouting expeditions, or faced the dangers of bushwhackers and roving Confederate units.  Deployment in the vicinity of Charleston in 1863, and in the Bermuda Hundred Campaign and at Cold Harbor in 1864 marked the unit's subsequent wartime service.  In all of these cases, whether confronting enemy forces, guerrillas, diseases, or the myriad threats posed by transportation or nature, the command exhibited fortitude, laced with the grumbling that marked the soldier's greatest prerogative in camp and communications with those at home.</p><p>Picking up where two previous regimental historians left off, historian Edward G. Longacre takes a fresh look at the Ninth New Jersey Volunteer Infantry's role in the American Civil War.  Taking his title, <i>The Sharpshooters</i>, from the unit's reputation for proficiency in fire-arms and accuracy in marksmanship, the author follows the regiment through service that extended from 1862 until mustering out in 1865.  Distinctive uniforms and renown for effectiveness in the field were the essential underpinnings for pride among those who served in the command.  Although success did not always crown the unit's efforts, as evidenced in Virginia when left exposed on a flank resulted in heavy casualties, the Ninth New Jersey remained an esteemed part of the Union arsenal throughout the conflict.</p><p>The soldiers of the Ninth exhibited qualities that featured both positive and negative aspects of their existence in the field.  Brave and resourceful under fire, the men often demonstrated that quieter moments in camp and bivouac would be anything but by quarreling or consuming spirituous drink.  If earlier regimental historians desired to de-emphasize the darker and more unsavory examples of soldier life to assist the surviving veterans and the families of those who served in avoiding them, the modern examiner was under less constraint to do so.  Consequently, the story of the Ninth New Jersey as presented here is more comprehensive and uncompromising than those preceding it.  Even so, Longacre's account is an unabashedly admiring one.</p><p>The greatest contribution of this work comes in adding or enhancing elements of significance to the Civil War soldier experience for a modern readership.  Displaying the attitudes that many of the men held toward the Southern civilians and African Americans they encountered allows for a fuller discussion of these aspects of the war.  The members of the regiment largely hailed from conservative Democratic roots, but disdain for ""Copperheads"" and support for the Union war effort remained incontrovertible, despite concerns among some of the men over President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation when it came to the forefront of public awareness.</p><p>Edward Longacre has a lengthy list of studies to his credit.  He adds to these a compelling history of a unit called upon to serve largely in less well-known theaters, yet whose performances often had an out-sized effect on the successes achieved for Union arms in those fields.  Readers will find much to learn about the dedication of these men from New Jersey and the role they played in helping to bring the war to a successful conclusion.</p>									<p><i>Brian Steel Wills is the Director of the Center for the Study of the Civil War Era and Professor of History at Kennesaw State University.

6502	9781107637634	$24.99	Lincoln and the Democrats: The Politics of Opposition in the Civil War		Neely, Mark E. Jr.			"The Northern Democrats: Muddled and Mythologized and Stubbornly Loyal to the Union<p>In 1938, Professor James G. Randall asked the question, ""Has the Lincoln theme been exhausted?"" We know the answer by now -- it hasn't been and probably never will be. But if every nuance of America's 16th president continues to be re-examined to the minutest degree, the story of the party that opposed him has been largely neglected. Pulitzer Prize-winner Mark E. Neely, Jr. does his part to help rectify this in <i>Lincoln and the Democrats</i>, a probing and often revelatory look at the loyal opposition during the Civil War.</p><p>Neely's credentials as a Lincoln scholar are formidable. In reading this book of interrelated essays, there's a sense of deep knowledge informing his interpretations. He offers insightful critiques of various earlier studies of the Civil War era, including such works as Joel Sibley's <i>A Respectable Minority, George M. Frederickson's <i>The Inner Civil War</i> and Jean Baker's Affairs of Party</i>. Essentially, Neely takes issue with the familiar claim that the Democrats were dominated by traitors and primarily motivated by racism during the years of Lincoln's presidency. His view is more complex, informed by a careful reading of the Democratic party press of the time.</p><p>Rather than stress the bitter partisanship between Democrats and Republicans, Neely points out how private and civil institutions functioned to help support the Union war effort.  Democrat-controlled local governments generally voted to fund military volunteers (something Republican officials didn't always do).  Neely cites the interesting case of Tammany Hall paying for exemptions from the draft after the horrific New York anti-draft riots of 1863. He goes into detail to demonstrate that the U.S. Sanitary Commission was more than a charity project by the Republicans (as Frederickson and others have claimed).  Neely uses these examples to assert that Northern Democrats were largely supportive of the war.</p><p>The book's middle chapters seek to disprove that the Democrats were controlled by their notorious peace wing while exploring the party's rather vague ideas about the Constitution. Studies like Jennifer L. Weber's <i>Copperheads</i> (2006) have emphasized the active role of disunionist elements in the Democratic Party. Neely takes a very different view, stressing the isolation of the more extreme peace advocates. He likewise disputes the notion that the Democrats were in thrall to white supremacist ideas. He delves into the sordid career of pro-slavery advocate Dr. John Van Evrie to demonstrate how little real influence this noxious figure had among party elected officials or the rank and file.  New York governor Horatio Seymour was more typical of the cautiously moderate leaders the Democrats followed. (Of course, the Democratic Party's ideology was indisputably racist. Neely's point is that discussions of race didn't dominate the party's pitch to the voters during the Civil War.)</p><p><i>Lincoln and the Democrats</i> is particularly valuable in examining the claim that the Democrats represented an unbroken political tradition from the Jefferson Administration onwards. They built up this tradition to counterbalance the Republican attempt to make loyalty to the Union their exclusive property.  Identity as a Democrat became a form of nationalism that transcended ideology or stands on the issues. Stubborn partisanship kept the party alive at a time when many predicted its demise. According to Neely, the Democratic Party ""pretty much invented the idea of the loyal opposition in war."" (83)</p><p>At times, there didn't seem much else besides tradition and the will to survive to keep the Democrats going. Neely notes that 1864 Democratic presidential nominee George B. McClellan ""was no politician at all""he stood for nothing in politics."" (125) Disagreeing with many past historians, he portrays the party's ideas about the Constitution as opportunistic and incoherent rather than a principled defense of conservatism.  Despite noisy demands by some Democrats about settling the war through negotiation, the party ""could not figure out a plan for peace."" (170)  McClellan's views (such as they were) didn't mesh with the party's 1864 platform, contributing to the sense of desperation that afflicted the Democrats that year.</p><p>Neely concludes his book with a provocative exploration of Lincoln's constitutional views.  Lincoln had been on ""the steady course of liberal antislavery constitutional interpretation"" until the looming Civil War forced him to veer in a different direction. (175) His proposed amendments to help stave off secession didn't show him at his best. Far more noble and progressive were his efforts to expand his pardoning power and reach for a humanitarian standard in international law. Neely discusses the fascinating case of Spanish slave-trader Jose Agustin Arguelles to show how Lincoln favored human rights over narrow legal precedents.</p><p>Surprisingly, Neely doesn't make many direct comparisons between Lincoln's ideas and those of the Northern Democrats. (This may be because so few of the latter had any substantive ideas to offer.) The value of <i>Lincoln and Democrats</i> doesn't lie in a tight linear narrative or the pitting of one historical figure against another. Rather, the book focuses in on specific aspects of Civil War era scholarship and challenges some long-held assumptions with vigor. Anyone curious about the Democratic Party's conflicted past -- as well as Lincoln's growth as a constitutional thinker -- will find this book well worth reading.</p> <p><i>Barry Alfonso is a journalist, book reviewer and independent scholar in Pittsburgh, PA.

6341	9780807161111	$65.00	Slave Against Slave: Plantation Violence in the Old South		Forret, Jeff			"The Nuance of Violence: Reassessing Intraracial Conflict on the Plantation <p>No matter how well researched, no matter how beautifully written, our understanding of American slavery often takes the form of furtive glimpses through moving keyholes. When we are granted a view, our subject quickly disappears into the unknown. Next to the history of the plantation house and its residents, the paucity of reliable and detailed sources on the people tied to those homes is a source of constant frustration.  Given these general contours, it is not surprising that the historiography of slavery is so contentious and controversial. Accordingly and unfortunately, there is no better place to observe the functioning of a zero-sum dynamic. </p>  <p>When the brutality of slavery is emphasized (see Stanley Elkins), slave agency is minimized. When slave community and agency are investigated (see John Blassingame), the apparatus of control seems reduced. Indeed, in the case of Blassingame and the many historians inspired by <i>Slave Community</i>, critics saw evidence that challenged the cohesiveness of the slave community being deliberately ignored. Inspired by Peter Kolchin's criticisms, Jeff Forret's <i>Slave Against Slave</i> seeks to expose what Kolchin called ""the grubby reality"" of the slave community. In particular, Forret explores acts of violence committed by slaves against other slaves. </p>  <p>While bestselling authors like Ed Baptist and popular history like <i>12 Years a Slave</i> have emphasized the horror and ubiquity of violence that defined the institution of slavery, Forret's study explores what kind of violence was taking place amongst the slaves themselves. As he explains, in order to truly comprehend ""the culture of those held in bondage"" we have to look at intraracial slave violence. Doing so makes it possible, Forret argues, ""to elucidate slaves' cultural values in their own terms"" and to ""complicate our understanding of black life under slavery."" (25, 27, 70) </p><p>Forret does a wonderful job of both problematizing his sources and explaining how he uses them. Indeed, this book would be immensely useful simply to walk young scholars through the use of a complex source base. In Forret's case, these are mostly court records, which he manages to use deftly to emphasize dynamics that not many in the antebellum world were recording or concerned with. Forret, on the other hand, reveals a great deal of life (and violence) taking place in the slave quarters. He also does a careful job of explaining, through his sources, that this violence does not make the slaves themselves better or worse, just more three-dimensional, especially to those seeking to understand the history of American slavery. </p>  <p>Through this exploration of slave on slave violence, Forret strikes on a greater than zero-sum approach to these historical actors' humanity and their inherent complexity. The thrust of this study underscores the truly devastating inhumanity of the institution of slavery and those who designed it while keeping the agency of slaves constantly in focus. Forret makes a great case, one that dovetails very nicely with all the recent scholarship on slavery and capitalism, that a system of labor and society so imbued with violence truly saturated all involved in very different ways. </p>  <p>Still, it is difficult to forget the circumstances of Blassingame and his historical moment of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Blassingame's work on slave community was so influential because it arrived in a moment where black humanity and black history demanded to be acknowledged by a hostile world. That dynamic certainly does not endorse hagiographies of slaves or slave community, but it begs the question of the unique demands and responsibilities scholars of slavery take on. Moreover, we must still ask, notwithstanding Ed Baptist or 12 Years a Slave, about the current tilt of our public, popular and scholarly histories: is there still hostility to slave humanity and agency? While the answer must be yes, Jeff Forret makes a powerful case that without the dark side of that humanity, our history will not be any better off than it was before. </p><p><i>R.

6562	9780807166062	$49.95	Reconstruction in Alabama: From Civil War to Redemption in the Cotton South		Fitzgerald, Michael W.			"The Rise and Fall of Reconstruction in Alabama<p>On the first page of <i>Reconstruction in Alabama: From Civil War to Redemption in the Cotton South</i>, we learn that 1905 was the last time a scholarly book was published on the Civil War and Reconstruction in Alabama. Surely this topic is in need of an update. And there is no better person to do it that Michael Fitzgerald. For most of his academic career, he has thought deeply about Reconstruction and explored many of its facets in Alabama, first with his groundbreaking <i>The Union League Movement in the Deep South</i>, and then in his innovative study on popular politics (<i>Urban Emancipation</i>) and also his synthetic work on southern Reconstruction (<i>Splendid Failure</i>). Interspersed among these major works, he has published more than a dozen articles and essays on Reconstruction in Alabama. But the value of <i>Reconstruction in Alabama</i> is much more than a mere revision of Walter Lynwood Fleming's racist interpretation from 1905. Here we have one of the leading historians of Reconstruction weighing in on many of the most difficult and enduring questions of the era.</p><p>Ever attentive to Reconstruction historiography, Fitzgerald has framed his book not on the black experience, as Eric Foner and Steve Hahn did, but on divisions among white Alabamians. Beginning with secession, he notes that most of northern Alabama voted against secession while southern Alabama did the opposite. These divisions over Unionism festered during the war years and blew up into a bitter guerilla war in the north. After Confederate defeat, Unionists hoped for protection from the federal government. Instead, Alabama's white voters embraced former Confederates, although not the most rabid, to guide the state back into the Union. Seeking to postpone a swift return of state authority and to ensure longer access to federal troops, Unionists took up the cause of freedmen's rights and argued for a more sustained intervention in the state. This, Fitzgerald contends, was the origin of the often troubled Reconstruction alliance between black and white Unionists.</p><p>The struggle of these Unionists and rank-and-file Republicans is somewhat obscured by the book's state-level focus, the consequence of which is that state leaders and state policies drive the narrative. At times, Fitzgerald interrupts this traditional history of governors, elections, and laws. In his fifth chapter, ""Black Liberation,"" he examines the struggle for black freedom and the reorganization of the plantation system. The rise of tenant farming, he argues, provided a measure of stability that plantation owners could live with and thus provided a crucial space for black politics to sink roots and begin to grow. Planter tolerance of free labor and a willingness to accept black political empowerment along with northern white Unionism stifled the formation of an all-white, racist campaign to drive black people into subservience. That would come later. But in the late 1860s and early 1870s, ""freedpeople [had] real leverage"" and pragmatically deployed their power to better their lives (8).</p><p>Although military Reconstruction marks a decisive turning point in Alabama's history, important continuities existed between Democrat, military, and Republican administrations that explain the persistence of both radical changes as well as the violent opposition to Reconstruction. Beginning with Democratic Governor Robert M. Patton, all the governors placed a high priority on railroad promotion, often to the detriment of black people's citizenship rights. Republican Governor William Hugh Smith, for instance, did little to counter Klan terrorism for fear of alienating conservative whites and imperiling his efforts to build the Alabama & Chattanooga line. Black voters were never as enamored with railroads as elites were, but they did appreciate the thousands of new railroad construction jobs as well as capital investment in local communities. But the laws crafted by political leaders favored the creditors and did not provide sufficient restraint on using state credit to finance projects. In particular, Gov. Smith ascribed millions of dollars of railroad bonds to the state, an obligation that weighed down and doomed subsequent administrations. Railroad men bribed and cajoled lawmakers to enact these favorable terms, but it was not, contrary to the racist invectives of the Dunning school historians, black voters or black lawmakers that spearheaded railroad corruption.</p> <p>Despite the modest efforts of state officials in both Democrat and Republican administrations to promote social stability and labor peace, the Klan rampaged through much of the state. Indeed, it was the very attention to freedpeople's improvement by the state that sparked a backlash by impoverished white men. They rallied to the Ku Klux Klan not merely, Fitzgerald suggests, because of biracial politics and Republican rule but because they had suffered substantial economic losses as a result of emancipation. A close analysis of Klan participants reveals that they suffered a tenfold loss of wealth owing to war and the liberation of black people. The Klan suppressed enough black votes and participated in enough electoral fraud in 1870 to ensure the election of a Democratic governor, Robert Lindsay. But freedpeople found other ways to maximize their leverage.</p> <p>Republican delegates produced a progressive constitution in 1868 that radically restructured state government by providing for a more equal justice system, establishing free, public schools, and providing state credit for private development projects. High cotton stabilized the plantation belt, which led to more negotiations instead of coercion between planters and tenants, and planters learned to tolerate black political power. Elite white acceptance of Reconstruction gave black people a space to press for higher political offices and new civil rights legislation. But what is most interesting about the growing sophistication of black politics, Fitzgerald argues, was their flexibility and dexterity in the face of white hostility. Indeed, what scholars have not fully appreciated is ""how widely freedpeople deterred violence"" and ""how normal life appeared"" in the black belt, at least before 1874 (9).</p> <p>The relative progress and stability produced by Reconstruction began to quickly unravel after the economic crash of 1873. While historians usually emphasize the spike in urban employment and the turn of northern public opinion against Republicans, Fitzgerald argues that the Panic had a direct impact on Alabama agriculture. The depression caused cotton prices to plummet, plunging plantations into chaos and prompting planters to align with the White League and other reactionary forces. The collapse of the cotton economy brought Alabama's white Democratic factions together in a united racist campaign that ultimately overthrew Reconstruction in the state. Efforts in Congress to pass a new civil rights law further tainted Alabama Republicans in the eyes of most white Alabamians. ""Focusing on the [federal] civil rights bill,"" explains Fitzgerald, ""allowed Democrats to channel all other white social grievances"" (309). The backlash from railroad debt also hurt Republican chances, as they were identified with the state support of economic development. Although the generous railroad policies had originated from former Whigs, the debt issue prompted most Democrats to embrace a Jacksonian perspective on state aid, ruling out the use of state credit for future private development.</p> <p>Democratic election victories in 1874 ushered in a Redemption era that began to push black people out of formal politics and allowed landowners to more easily control workers. These changes were enshrined in a new constitution that repealed guaranteed educational funding and ended black jury service. After 1880, black officeholding and positive government faded away and were replaced by white elites who then spread a fraudulent story of corrupt carpetbaggers and freedmen to justify their rule.</p><p><i>Reconstruction in Alabama</i> is not a major departure from existing scholarship.

6416	9781421420608	$50.00	Reading the Market: Genres of Financial Capitalism in Gilded Age America		Knight, Peter			"The ""Culture of the Market"" Revised     <p>After at least a generation of neglect, the  field of economic history has in recent years  become visible again, if not quite  trendy.  Many observers have viewed such renewed  interest  as something of a scholarly aftershock of the Great  Recession, which reminded most people (including, somewhat surprisingly,  many historians) that the grubby world of ""getting and spending"" --Wordsworth's famously disparaging description -- matters a lot and is worth studying.   The manifestations of such renewed interest are everywhere, most notably, of course, in the wild success of Thomas Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century (2013), which actually deals with income and wealth inequality since the  eighteenth century, and in the burgeoning movement in the U.S. field of scholars working on what has become known as ""the new history of American capitalism.""    Such scholars have treated a number of topics, but are perhaps best known for their treatments of slavery, or, more to the point, the economic importance of slavery to the growth and development of the entire United States, not just to slaveholders or even just to the South.</p>     <p>However prominent studies of slavery have been  to the ""new history of American capitalism"" -- and they have been prominent indeed -- such studies haven't  completely  crowded  out  work  on other important themes.   For example, a good bit of scholarship in this vein has focused on questions  relating  in one way or another to money, banking, and finance per se, or on  correlative matters such as debt, credit, risk, speculation, gambling, counterfeiting, and confidence games.   Peter Knight's smart and sophisticated new book <i>Reading the Market: Genres of Financial Capitalism in Gilded Age America</i> is an exemplar in this regard, providing, as it does, a rich, if difficult and occasionally opaque analysis of how financial markets were rendered understandable in Gilded Age America  during the same time period and as part of the same process  wherein they were being made. </p>     <p>Building on, if sometimes deviating from the work of influential cultural critics and social theorists such as Mary Poovey, Marieke de Goede, Alex Preda, and  Niklas Luhmann, Knight  is concerned, first and foremost, with explaining the tortuous process by which ""ordinary Americans"" in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century came at once to understand and to  become ""emotionally invested"" in markets, particularly financial markets.   Such understanding and emotional investment, according to Knight, preceded and created the necessary conditions for widespread participation by ordinary Americans in the stock market, commodity exchanges, and the like.  How did this process work?  In a variety of ways, but mainly through various channels of popular culture, which, taken together, succeeded over time in personalizing ""the market"" generally and financial markets in particular even as  capitalism took deep root in the U.S. and markets in the country  became more and more abstract. </p>       <p>In so arguing, Knight breaks with both pioneering  social theorists such as Sir Henry Maine and Georg Simmel  and with later theorists such as Karl Polanyi and Luhmann who depicted more linear processes  of social evolution whereby, as market society develops,  concepts such as reciprocity and obligation give way to market mechanisms, status yields to contract, and trust is ""mechanized"" and increasingly embedded not in human beings but in ""abstract and anonymous systems, including legal, regulatory, and scientific institutions"" (p. 17).   Things are not nearly so simple, claims Knight, who believes that with the intensification and entrenchment of the capitalist system in Gilded Age America a ""double movement"" occurred in cultural terms, whereby ""economic ideas were abstracted and, in turn, humanized,"" (p. 20), the impersonal personalized, and the abstract concretized, all of which cultural work served the interests ultimately of finance capital and capitalists. </p>       <p>The author, it should be noted, makes it clear that with regard to popular culture he is not invoking the trope of personification, and, thus, arguing that Gilded Age America was made safe for finance capitalism because the cultural forms he  studies  comforted ordinary folk by simply attributing  ""human emotions and intentions to transpersonal entities"" such as the stock market"" (p. 20).  Rather, Knight prefers here the more complex trope of prosopopeia, which allows us to view such forms as ""personaliz[ing] and abstract[ing] at one and the same time,""  thereby helping to create a ""rhetorical accommodation,""  however unstable,  to the 'great transformation' of capitalism between roughly 1870 and 1920 (p. 21). </p>       <p>As suggested at the outset of this review, <i>Reading the Market</i> is at times rather abstruse and, as such, though not for the uninitiated or faint of heart.  Fortunately, if readers are reasonably successful in grappling with the theoretical and methodological sections of the book -- admittedly, a big if -- they will find the five individual cases into which it is divided fascinating, even stimulating  to work through.    These chapter-long cases  treat seriatim:  the development of market reporting and the market report; the story of the stock ticker and the useful ""legibility""  it brought to increasingly abstract financial markets; the visual representations of such markets, which did so much to personalize the impersonal and concretize the abstract; the persistent sense that cons, confidence games, and private information informed  Gilded Age financial markets (which case Knight attempts to make mainly through discussions of literary works by Herman Melville, William Dean Howells, and Edith Wharton); and in the concluding chapter  ""a range of  conspiracy-minded interpretations of financial capitalism from the 1870s to the early 1900s,"" (p. 193) which the author believes captures nicely the era's need to personalize abstractions such as the financial panics of the early 1870s, the early 1890s, and 1907.  Readers familiar with Knight's earlier work on ""conspiracy cultures"" will find this last case especially revealing.   After the cases, the author ends with a brief epilogue wherein he discusses the ways in which the ""popular modes of 'reading the market'"" (p. 254) he treats in his study have remained the same and changed over the last hundred years. </p>     <p>This intriguing book illuminates much about markets and, particularly, about the ""culture of the market"" as financial capitalism began its will to power in America.  At times the relationship between the actual history of Gilded Age financial markets and the way in which such markets were represented and interpreted  is  rather tenuous, but,  in the author's defense, Knight is writing as a cultural critic and professor of American Studies not as a practitioner of, much less believer in positive economics. </p><p><i>Peter A.

6506	9780674972561	$39.95	Vanishing America: Species Extinction, Racial Peril, and the Origins of Conservation		Powell, Miles A			"To Preserve Nature and Protect Whiteness: Environmentalism after the Civil War<p>In July 2015, <i>The New York Times</i> ran an op-ed that focused on a well-known problem: our national parks and the environmental movement that spawned them are overwhelmingly white. Minorities comprised 22 percent of visitors to national park in 2011, the last date for which data is available, despite making up 37 percent of the U.S. population. And as of 2014, people of color made up only 12 percent of all environmental NGO staff. For scholars seeking the historical roots of this problem, Miles A. Powell's <i>Vanishing America: Species Extinction, Racial Peril, and the Origins of Conservation</i> is an excellent place to start. He argues that, in effect, the environmental movement remains white because the very idea of preserving the wilderness, an idea at the root of the environmental movement, emerged from an effort to preserve notions of whiteness. The ""enduring association between wilderness and whiteness,"" Powell writes, ""helps explain why many of the nation's non-white citizens continue to feel uncomfortable in parks and other sites of outdoor recreation today.""</p>  <p><i>Vanishing America</i> traces the ties between white racial anxiety and the environmental movement, covering the period from the mid-nineteenth century to the mid-twentieth century. Powell homes in on the published and private writings of some of the most well-known environmentalists -- George Perkins Marsh, John Muir, Aldo Leopold -- as well as lesser known figures who were equally influential. Faced with the closing of the western frontier, rapid industrialization and the unprecedented influx of eastern and southern European immigrants, the movement's white male elite began to fear their own race's survival. They established parks and saved its wildlife in order to create spaces for leisure, sport, and white racial invigoration. Equally important, and perhaps most ground-breaking, Powell argues that the environmentalist movement had a profound influence on early twentieth century racial policies. Many of the environmentalists who helped save the buffalo and bald eagle, for instance, became outspoken proponents of eugenics, sterilization and exclusionary immigration policies. Thinking about how to save endangered animals, in other words, provided a model for how to think about saving the white race.</p>  <p>Powell, an assistant professor of environmental history at Nanyang Technological University, in Singapore, builds on a small but growing literature connecting the history of environmentalism to histories of race. While other historians have explored how the idea of ""wilderness"" -- itself an artificial construction -- became entangled with notions of whiteness, to my knowledge no one has established the connection so convincingly. Before the Civil War, Powell argues, the wilderness was not yet perceived as something in need of saving. Most white elites measured civilizational progress by their ability to domesticate and control nature, rather than preserve it. Both Native Americans and people of African descent were seen as being either unable or unwilling to domesticate nature; this in turn helped justify ""horrific acts of cruelty"" against each group. ""Domesticating"" African Americans as slaves could be framed as an effort to preserve their race from extinction; similarly, removing Native Americans to reservations was often premised on the notion that they ""would otherwise vanish like untamable animals.""</p><p>But in the decades following the Civil War, white attitudes toward nature changed dramatically. Rather than something to be tamed, nature became something in need of preserving. This transformation, Powell argues, was intimately tied to fears of white racial decline. The post-Civil War seizure of indigenous lands in the West, coupled with massive immigration and urbanization in the East, triggered fears that old-stock white Americans would face a similar fate to what many believed was already happening to Native Americans, and what had recently happened to America's once ubiquitous passenger pigeon -- they were becoming extinct. In this context, white male elites banded together in the 1870s and 1880s to preserve allegedly pristine, people-less parks ""for the invigorating excursions of white adventurers"" -- and the environmental movement was born.</p>  <p>In addition to the racial roots of these first conservation efforts, Powell expertly teases out the movement's gendered and class dimensions. In 1887, Theodore Roosevelt, a Harvard graduate, teamed up George Bird Grinnell -- a fellow blue-blood New Yorker, Yale graduate, and founder of the Audubon Society -- to establish the Boone and Crockett Club. Both men saw maintaining the wilderness and its wildlife as central to maintaining their own privileged, white, masculine identity. They knew that razing forests and keeping hunting grounds unregulated would destroy their sport, and in their advocacy for wildlife conservation and national parks, they made a point to contrast their own genteel hobby with what they derided as the uncivilized, environmentally hazardous hunting practices of Native Americans, African Americans and lower-class whites. Though environmentalist groups like the Sierra Club are better-known, Powell reminds us that it was in fact these genteel, exclusively male hunting groups that first defined the environmentalist agenda.</p>  <p>By the turn of the twentieth century, conservationists had considerable success: they helped create the Yosemite and Yellowstone national parks and helped save the buffalo from extinction. Powell is most illuminating when he shows how these successes in turn helped shape racial policies in the early twentieth century. Many members of the Boone and Crockett Club, for instance, became leading eugenicists. ""Perceiving a direct link between the decline of American wildlife and the degeneration of the white American race,"" Powell writes, ""prominent nature advocates often pushed as hard for the passage of immigration restriction and eugenics legislation as they did for wildlife preservation."" Well-known conservationists like William Temple Hornaday and Theodore Roosevelt are as much a part of this story as less-studied figures like Madison Grant. Grant founded the American Bison Society in 1905, which helped save the animal from extinction, and soon began applying conservationist thinking to his advocacy for preserving America's white ""Nordic"" race.  In 1916, he published the best-selling <i>Passing of the Great Race</i>, which argued that the Nordic race's survival in America ""required a continental area isolated and protected for long ages from the intrusion of other races"" -- a direct echo of his conservationist writing. Meanwhile, Hornaday likened Italian immigrants to invasive species -- ""give him the power to act,"" he wrote in <i>Our Vanishing Wild Life</i> (1913), comparing Italians to mongoose -- ""and he will quickly exterminate every wild thing that wears feathers or hair.""</p><p>One might think that the Nazi's extermination campaigns would have led environmentalists to distance themselves from racial policies. But Powell makes a powerful case that mid-century environmentalists continued to advocate for the preservation of white people even after the Holocaust, in the form of policies aimed at non-white population control. Powell uncovers a robust correspondence between Aldo Leopold, a revered environmentalist and professor of game management at the University of Wisconsin, and William Vogt, a leading postwar proponent of global population control. Vogt befriended Leopold during their campaign to save the bald eagle from extinction in 1940. Shortly after the Second World War, Vogt drew directly from Leopold's ecological theories, ones based on the land's natural carrying capacity, to argue against physicians' attempts to cure diseases in the developing world. Even if physicians succeeded, Vogt argued, there would not be enough arable land to feed the excess population. Better let them die from disease than starvation, his thinking went. Powell contends that, whether they were aware of it or not, the concerns that Leopold and Vogt expressed regarding unfettered population growth, almost exclusively in non-white regions, ""dovetailed with longstanding Anglo-American fears of "" threats to whiteness.""</p><p>Though focused on environmentalism's white male elite, <i>Vanishing America</i> is sensitive to the ways women and non-whites, particularly Native Americans, contributed to and challenged the dominant environmentalist agenda. Yet for a book aimed at making the environmentalist movement more inclusive, and one that highlights urbanization's influence, <i>Vanishing America</i> could have benefited from grappling more with the effects of the Great Migration on the movement's leaders. By the Second World War, millions of African Americans had fled to northern cities, and though we do not read about them, their arrival might well have influenced the kind of white flight to the wilderness that Powell observes occurring in the wake of the influx of eastern and southern Europeans to these same cities.</p>  <p>Moreover, the long history of environmental neglect endured by urban Americans, particularly African Americans, begs for some kind of analysis. The pollution of urban environments and the erection of urban parks in black neighborhoods entailed a similar kind of racial othering and physical displacement that Powell shows happening to Native Americans along the western frontier. The failure of the early environmentalists to take up these urban, often black, environmental issues helped spawn a distinct ""environmental justice"" movement, led predominantly by people of color, in the 1970s. We will not fully understand why the environmental movement remains so white until we study how and why it refused, early on, to champion these black environmental issues. In any event, he has written a book that ought to be required reading for anyone interested in understanding this enduring problem.</p> <p><i>Eric Herschthal is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the New York Public Library's Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture.</i></p>"	Herschthal, Eric	Summer 2017	2017-8-1	Review			Harvard University Press		Politics;Reconstruction;Science;Social_History			"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=245 alt=\""Product Cover\"" border=0 src=\""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/vanishingwr.jpg\"">"							
6564	1479870420	$40.00	Dark Work: The Business of Slavery in Rhode Island		Clark-Pujara, Christy			"Tracing Slavery's Tentacles in New England<p>Christie Clark-Pujara's <i>Dark Work: The Business of Slavery in Rhode Island</i> has great ambitions for such a little work.  Like many recent historians, Clark-Pujara wants to explore the relationship of slavery and capitalism.  One of Clark-Pujara's main goals is to contribute to the efforts of Sven Beckert and others who are revitalizing a modern version of Eric Williams's thesis on the relationship of slavery and the industrial revolution.  Clark-Pujara argues that slavery made essential contributions to the rise of the industrial revolution in southern New England.  As she writes on page 29, ""Northerners were not peripheral to the development of slavery in the Atlantic world."" Slavery was more prevalent in Rhode Island, especially South County and the ports of Providence and Newport, than many people might imagine.  Moreover, Rhode Island traders were deeply involved in the slave trade.  In the years just before the Revolution, Rhode Island equipped three quarters of the slave trading voyages outfitted in British North America.  Unlike early abolitionists, who used the horrors of the middle passage as a way to exemplify the greatest horrors of slavery, Clark-Pujara focuses her attention on the businesses tangential to the slave trade to show how far the tentacles of slavery extended -- from farms to workshops, from wharfs to distilleries -- throughout Rhode Island.</p>    <p>Slavery itself was put on the path to gradual extinction in Rhode Island in 1784 (and the last two Rhode Island slaves were finally emancipated in 1842), but Clark-Pujara insists that focusing on emancipation and a 1787 law that prohibited Rhode Islanders from participating in the transatlantic slave trade obscures the way that white Rhode Islanders continued to profit from the business of slavery.  As she writes on page 85, ""slave trading actually grew tremendously after the slave trade ban was passed."" Drawing on the story of the DeWolf family, whose activities play a prominent role in Katrina Browne's 2008 <i>Traces of the Trade</i>, Clark-Pujara shows that slave trading remained an important part of mercantile life in early republic Rhode Island.  She finds a similar pattern in the ancillary industries.  Even as the number of people enslaved in Rhode Island declined, Clark-Pujara suggests on page 84 that ""the number of people involved in the business of slavery increased.""</p>  <p>At the end of <i>Dark Work</i>, Clark-Pujara turns her attention to what she calls, on pages 4-5, ""my primary concern:"" how blacks ""responded to the restrictions imposed by a socio-economic system that depended on oppressing people of African descent."" In a world where slavery was woven into so much of Rhode Island's economy, blacks found themselves persecuted and attacked. Blacks responded to this is a variety of ways, including pursuing economic advancement. By the late eighteenth century, many Rhode Island blacks decided that forming voluntary associations -- including the Free African Union Society (1780), the African Benevolent Society (1807) and the African Union Meeting House (1819) -- was a smart way to promote their interests.  In 1842, black activism became more clearly political, as two hundred armed black men joined the effort to suppress Dorr's populist revolt, which lost favor with blacks when the People's Convention promulgated a revised state constitution that explicitly excluded blacks from suffrage.  On the eve of the Civil War, many blacks supported the effort to end segregated schools in Providence, Newport, and Bristol, an effort that finally accomplished its goal in 1866.  By this time, the Civil War had ended, but not before hundreds of blacks had rallied enlisted in the Rhode Island Fourteenth Regiment, which eventually enlisted more than eighteen hundred black men, many Rhode Island citizens.</p><p>The way that <i>Dark Work</i> challenges historians to think about New England's deep and sometimes hidden connections to slavery makes it a useful book, and Clark-Pujara's way of conceptualizing slavery raises new questions about how historians should think about the broad reach of the slave economy.  After all, many people in Rhode Island may have made money directly or indirectly from slavery, but what does that mean?  Clark-Pujara offers some suggestions.  On page 156 of her conclusion, she notes the ""centrality of the business of slavery to the northern economy."" But was it really central?  On page 7, she uses a different metaphor, suggesting that ""bondage remained a defining"" aspect of northern life.""  Did the slave economy ""define"" the north?  Not surprisingly, Clark-Pujara's claims seem to overstate what the evidence she produces suggests about the importance of slavery to the northern economy.  Perhaps one of the problems here is that Clark-Pujara has no way to distinguish the parts of Rhode Island's economy with less significant connections to the slave economy from places, such as the mills, the distilleries, and the wharfs, where products made and consumed by slaves were essential to the functioning of these economic units.</p>  <p>Likewise, her steadfast focus on finding some connection to the slave economies means that she deemphasizes the importance of change over time. But Rhode Island's place in the slave economy changed radically over time: from the seventeenth century, when Rhode Island had some small slaveholding, to the eighteenth century, when Rhode Island merchants latched themselves on to the sugar revolution, to the nineteenth century, when slaveholding and slave trading had become marginalized and abolition emerged, but Rhode Island's connections to the textile revolution made its new factories dependent on the South for both materials and markets.  In each period, Rhode Island had some connection to economic world of slavery, but the ways that these connections manifested themselves were strikingly different.</p><p>Another place that Clark-Pujara could expand her discussion would be to look more systematically at how the slave economy related to Rhode Islanders' attitudes and beliefs.  For example, on page 7, she writes that the movement to abolish slavery in Rhode Island itself ""did not mean a new consciousness,"" mainly because Rhode Islanders were still connected to the world of slavery.  But it is possible to both remain enmeshed in the business of slavery and have new attitude toward slavery.  To make this argument stronger, Clark-Pujara would have to focus more on the evidence of Rhode Islanders' mindsets.  A few times, she offers provocative glimpses, but these cases indicate that a change was taking place in some Rhode Islanders' attitudes toward slavery.  For example, on page 93, she quotes Rowland G. Hazard, an agent for Peace-Dale Mills, who travelled extensively in the South.  During a state house debate on the Fugitive Slave Law, Hazard declared, ""My own convictions are that it [slavery] is the worst form of society for all concerned."" Or, on page 81, she quotes a Brown student, James Tallmadge, who launched what Clark-Pujara describes as ""a scathing indictment of slaveholding and trading at his commencement exercises."" In both cases, individuals were connected to institutions connected to slavery, but this did not stop these men from becoming outspoken opponents of slavery itself.  Despite these caveats, <i>Dark Work</i> is a valuable contribution to the field.  Hopefully it will stimulate more work that will help us think about the North's longstanding and troubling relationship to slavery.</p><p><i>Patrick H.

6339	9780809334780	$34.95	Citizen of a Wider Commonwealth: Ulysses S. Grant's Postpresidential Diplomacy		Campbell, Edwina S.			"U.S. Grant: Diplomat     <p>Being president of the United States is a tough act to follow. After living in the White House, a former president might find doing virtually anything afterward a bit of a letdown. Ulysses Grant faced that challenge after serving two terms from 1869 to 1877, but came up with an exciting short term plan. He, his wife Julia, son Jesse, and a group of friends would embark on a prolonged journey to places they had always dreamed of visiting in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. What was conceived as a pleasure trip morphed into an unofficial extended diplomatic mission. After learning about his predecessor's intentions, President Rutherford Hayes had Secretary of State William Evarts issue the Grant party special passports and inform all American foreign missions to assist them in any possible way. What ensued was a series of firsts for an ex-American president and American diplomacy during a circumnavigation of the world that lasted two years and four months. </p>     <p>Edwina Campbell has written a first-rate book on the subject. She is eminently qualified to do so, having served as an American diplomat for her first career and as a university professor for her second career. Her two most prominent previous books include <i>Germany's Past and Europe's Future: The Challenges of West German Foreign Policy</i> and <i>The Relevance of American Power: The Anglo-American Past and the Euro-Atlantic Future</i>. </p>     <p>Grant and his party departed Philadelphia on May 17, 1877 and reached Liverpool eleven days later. They took the train to London and swiftly immersed themselves in that nation's elite, meeting Queen Victoria and Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, being feted at London's Guildhall and lodged at Windsor castle, to name some of the highlights. But Grant also mingled with common Britons, strolled the streets, chatted with onlookers, and addressed business and labor groups. </p>      <p>They then crossed the English Channel to France, but there Grant had to tread lightly. The French had suffered a humiliating and catastrophic defeat in the Franco-Prussian War (1870-71), followed by a short-lived but bloody communist revolution in Paris known as the Commune (1871). After years of turmoil, moderate and conservative leaders formed the Third Republic in 1875, but the French remained bitterly split against each other. Grant did not want to appear to favor any one party or politician so he and his family traveled as private citizens. Eventually he had private meetings with President Patrick MacMahon and opposition leader Leon Gambetta, among numerous other prominent politicians and businessmen.      <p>The Grants spent over a year in Europe and visited every independent country. Campbell writes that by ""the end of 1878, he knew every president, monarch, and prime minister in Europe.""(133) At Nice they boarded the U.S.S. Vandalia to tour the central and eastern Mediterranean, with Pompeii, the Vatican, the Parthenon, the Pyramids, and Jerusalem the highlights, and fascinating stops in Genoa, Venice, Rome, Florence, Naples, Alexandria, Cairo, and Constantinople. </p>      <p>Grant proved to be an outstanding diplomat. He was always a far better listener than talker, a key diplomatic skill. He was genuinely interested in the people, politics, history, and culture of each country that he visited. He was fascinated with the various ways that countries were governed and people earned their livings, especially what worked and what did not work. He was self-effacing and down-to-earth, traits that got others to trust and open up to him. And yet he was renowned as the general who was decisive in winning the American victory in the Civil War. In both his informal meetings and formal speeches, he extolled the virtues of republicanism, the peaceful settlement of disputes, free labor, and public education. He was no internationalist but instead the quintessential American. He made an revealing admission when he explained the number one reason among many that he enjoyed Paris so much: ""One sees more Americans there than any place else in Europe, and I find it pleasant abroad exactly in proportion to the number of Americans one finds to talk to.""(85) </p>     <p>Occasionally there were diplomatic snags. In Rome, Ambassador George Perkins Marsh was so obsessed with the proper protocol for an ex-president for banquet seating arrangements with government officials and the foreign diplomatic corps that he finally refused to host one. The one thing that Grant found tedious was military reviews. He explained to German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck: ""The truth is I am more of a farmer than a soldier. I take little or no interest in military affairs""I never went into the army without regret and never retired without pleasure.""(63) </p>     <p>Originally Grant had not planned to journey around the globe. But a suggestion by General William Sherman, eagerly seconded by Julia, convinced him to do so. After he cabled his decision back to Washington, the State and Navy Departments conceived the idea of assigning the <i>U.S.S. Richmond</i> to convey him from Marseilles through the Suez Canal to the various ports along his Asian itinerary. Then came word that the <i>Richmond</i> was delayed several weeks so the Grant party took a series of commercial vessels to ports in South, Southeast, and East Asia. That turned out to be an advantage because Grant could hobnob with important officials and businessmen, mostly British, heading to various colonies or countries. </p>           <p>Beyond Europe the mass poverty they observed appalled Grant and his entourage. He offered this explanation for that condition: ""In the East they have a form of government and a civilization that will always repress progress and development""The people would be industrious if they had encouragement, but they are treated as slaves, and all they produce is taken from them for the benefit of the governing classes and to maintain them in a luxurious and licentious life.""(42) </p>      <p>Throughout his journey, Grant found his mind continually changing from what he expected to what he found. For instance, as an American he naturally imagined that British rule over its empire was repressive and exploitive. He was pleasantly surprised to find instead that British imperialism actually was progressive in promoting economic development and peace in war-torn regions. He correctly predicted that eventually, one by one, the colonies would fight for and win independence but the result would be ""rapine and murder and wars between native chiefs.""(109) </p>     <p>From Singapore, Grant left behind the British Empire to spend five months visiting the independent countries of Siam (Thailand), China, and Japan that had diplomatic and trade relations with the United States. In each country, he advocated what would be called the ""open door"" policy whereby Americans could freely trade, invest, and even proselytize there alongside people from other countries. He found that each government generally favored the open door notion if only to play off the different foreign countries against each other so that no one dominated let alone endangered its sovereignty. However, those governments drew the line at Christian attempts to convert their peoples, fearing that the result would be divisiveness, turmoil, and possibly even war. To an extraordinary degree, Grant sympathized with the struggles of the Siamese, Chinese, and Japanese governments to guard their sovereignty amidst constant pressure and jockeying for power by the western imperial countries: ""I should not blame them if they were to drive out all Europeans -- Americans included -- and make new treaties in which they would claim equal rights.""(128) He encouraged the Siamese, Chinese, and Japanese to see the United States as a counterweight to the Europeans who ""have no interests in Asia""that do not involve the humiliation and subjection of the Asiatic people.""(160) He also encouraged all three countries, but especially China and Japan, to forge peaceful, constructive relations among themselves. </p>      <p>Grant was astounded by how enterprising the overseas Chinese were with their ""wonderful shrewdness and industry, and are rapidly monopolizing the trade as carriers, merchants, mechanics, market-gardeners, and servants from Bombay eastward.""(141) That observation prompted endless discussions among the Grant entourage and their hosts over why some European and Asian cultures were more dynamic and successful than others. And that in turn opened Grant's mind to Chinese immigration to the United States, although he distinguished between accepting enterprising immigrants who came freely to the United States and barring those who were forced to come as quasi-slave labor. He assured his Chinese government hosts that he ""had none but the kindest feelings toward the Chinese people and nation"" and promised that Americans ""would extend to them if they chose to make their home with us, the same welcome they extended to all the rest of the world.""(113) This was a rare example of Grant's failing to foresee the future--Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882. </p>     <p>Yet Grant perceived a dark side to all that Chinese enterprise, ambition, and nationalism. Looking at a ""not very far distant"" future, he foresaw China making ""rapid strides towards modern civilization, and become dangerous rivals to all powers interested in the trade of the East. They are patient, enduring and of long suffering in their weakness. But once feeling themselves strong they are likely to become cruel, overbearing, and vindictive.""(137) That certainly describes contemporary China. After spending time in Japan, Grant revised his prediction about China. Japan's government was successfully modernizing the country while China's government was flailing at that challenge. Japan would be a threat to the power balance in the Far East long before China. </p>     <p>Grant finally stepped ashore at San Francisco on September 20, 1879. His journey did not end there. For six more weeks before reaching his home at Galena, Illinois on November 5, he journeyed across America meeting countless fellow citizens, as always listening far more than he spoke. He returned from his circumnavigation of the world to be the nation's leading expert on world affairs. He hoped to use that knowledge if the election of 1880 carried him back to the White House. Much to his regret, the Republican Party never seriously considered him, instead eventually rallying around General James Garfield. Of all the lessons Grant tried to share, perhaps this is the most enduring: ""America is respected throughout the world, but it is not to be presumed that""she is necessarily loved.""(186) </p> <p><i>Dr. William Nester is a professor at St. John's University and the author of thirty-five books on international relations, military history, and the nature of power, including</i>The Age of Lincoln and the Art of American Power.</p>"	Nester, William	Fall 2016	2016-11-1	Review			University of Southern Illinois Press		Biographies;Politics			"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=243 alt=\""Product Cover\"" border=0 src=\""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/campbellcitizenofawider.jpg\"">"							
6451	9781469630557	$34.95	The Yankee Plague: Escaped Union Prisoners and the Collapse of the Confederacy		Foote, Lorien			"Union Prisoners: Heralds of Defeat and Omens of Historical Process <p>For a few months in late 1864 and early 1865 a brigade of ragged Union soldiers flooded the Confederate backcountry, disrupting military operations, terrorizing southern civilians, and forming alliances with slaves, free blacks, and white Unionists.  This was not a bold raid by a dashing cavalry unit, but individual and small bands of ragged escapees from Confederate prison camps.  Lorien Foote has drawn on nearly one hundred published narratives, scores of unpublished narratives, and a wide array of other sources, to create a database of more than 3000 runaway Yankees. She has painstakingly recreated at least part of forty separate itineraries, and follows four particular groups from journey's beginning to end. The result is a well-conceived and well-written account of a phenomenon that caused consternation throughout the South and sparked an entire genre of memoirs after the war.</p> <p>But the value of the book transcends narrating the experiences of these hardy and determined men -- although she has captured the drama, poignancy, and adventure of their journeys, each of which offers a ripping yarn.  The accounts of the men who fled prison camps during the waning months of the Confederacy capture a moment when Confederate authority and discipline; civilian confidence and loyalty; tension between local, state, and Confederate authorities; and the roles played by women and African Americans had reached critical turning points.  Indeed, African Americans played major roles in the story; most escapees betrayed typical racist attitudes, and were at first almost completely unaware of the danger they posed to slaves or free blacks who aided them.  At the same time, all of the successful escapees admitted that they would not have reached freedom without help from African Americans, and at least some seemed to come to an understanding about the nuances of slavery and race relations.</p> <p>Foote's book can be seen as a case study of just how the Confederacy unraveled during its last months.  Indeed, the simple fact that so many men were able to escape reflected the disorder of the Confederate administration as the war reached its climax. Foote does not claim that the fugitives caused the Confederacy to collapse; rather, they were ""heralds"" of its imminent defeat. (20) </p><p>One particular passage demonstrates the chaos that the escapees helped to create: ""Humans by the thousands were on the move in the Blue Ridge during the winter of 1864-1865.  Escaped prisoners, refugees, recruits for the Union army. . . , Confederate deserters seeking sanctuary in Union lines, guerillas on the prowl, U. S. and Confederate raiders, and state militia units"" created a virtual traffic jam of the frightened, the angry, the disaffected, the patriotic, and the desperate. (91) </p>  <p>Foote offers vivid details of this backcountry disorder and of southern society, beginning with the startlingly inexperienced, ignorant, helpless, and ineffective government officials scrambling to hold things together. Escapees could not distinguish between white and black voices in the dark, or between the shacks in which poor whites and free blacks lived. Slaves were emboldened to act less like slaves once they started encountering the Yankees skulking through the countryside.  Throughout, readers come to understand the extent to which fugitives and southern civilians feared one another.</p>  	<p>I have just two caveats.  I would have liked to have seen more about the relationships formed between fugitives and southerners.  Readers glimpse the sympathy and gratitude, disdain and contempt, trust and suspicion that were all reflected in the interactions between fugitives and southern civilians, but the vignettes suggest a rich history of sectional, gender, and racial relationships that would be fascinating to explore more deeply.  Also, the epilogue seems a little rushed, and the relationship between the escapees and the 200,000 other Union prisoners seems undeveloped.  Or course, Foote indicates that her focus is on the men who were seen as <i>threats</i> to the Confederacy, not on those scarecrow-thin <i>victims</i> in the horrific post-war photographs we have all seen.  Yet all prisoners were included in a particularly important segment of the Union veteran community.  I wonder how well the escapees were integrated into the larger body of prisoner-veterans.  They were unique, but sometimes Foote seems to suggest that they were representative.  It seems to be a missed chance to fit them into the larger prisoner of war and veteran experiences.</p>  <p>Despite these comments -- which are really less criticisms than suggestions for sequels! -- this is an excellent book.  In addition to its vigorous writing style and extensive research, the many strengths of <i>The Yankee Plague</i> include the unique vantage point it offers to the internal collapse of the Confederacy's bureaucracy, military infrastructure, and morale; the reasons for widespread disaffection among war-weary southerners; and the complex interaction of race, gender, and politics on the Confederate frontier.  As Foote writes in her introduction, the conditions she describes show that the end of the Civil War was a ""process,"" not a date on the calendar, and the stories she tells demonstrate that ""amid the grand upheavals that ended the war, individuals struggled to survive, learned to see the world in new ways, and clung to what they knew before the conflict started."" (4)  By bringing order to the chaos that was the Confederate backcountry, The Yankee Plague depicts that ""process"" in an original and humane way.</p><p><i>James Marten is professor and chair of the history department at Marquette University.

6388	9781421419374	$49.95	Engineering Victory: How Technology Won the Civil War		Army, Thomas F. Jr.			"Victory Improvised<p><i>Engineering Victory: How Technology Won the Civil War</i>  by Thomas F. Army Jr. is one of several recent studies that examine military engineering in the Civil War. These include Justin Solonick's similarly titled <i>Engineering Victory: The Union Siege of Vicksburg</i>  (Southern Illinois University Press, 2015), which focuses on the engineering aspects of that siege, and Earl Hess's three works on field fortifications: <i>Field Armies and Fortifications in the Civil War</i>, <i>Trench Warfare under Grant and Lee</i>, and <i>In the Trenches at Petersburg</i>  (University of North Carolina Press, 2005, 2007, 2009). In his contribution to this trend, Army maintains that the North won the war because of its advantage in mechanical skills and a culture of innovation which gave Union armies an edge in military engineering that enabled them to maintain lines of supply and communication for operations deep inside Confederate territory.<p>Army develops this argument in three parts. The first explores the social origins of the sections' differing engineering capabilities. The author contends that the rise of industry in the North prompted common school reforms and a lyceum movement that enhanced literacy, numeracy, and basic knowledge, while industrial development put a premium on technical innovation. As a consequence, northern workers were given free rein to implement improvements that were then shared through mechanics' institutes, fairs and exhibitions, all of which further diffused technical knowledge among the northern public. In the South, however, the influence of slavery led to more limited educational opportunities as elites opposed public education to prevent the spread of ideas that could threaten slavery. Moreover, the few industrial concerns in the South were staffed largely by slaves who were neither encouraged to innovate nor permitted to share ideas. Because of these differences, the northern population was more amenable to a system of bottom-up technical innovation that enhanced the North's wartime engineering capacity.</p><p>Part II of <i>Engineering Victory</i> focuses on the establishment, composition, and initial operations of Civil War engineering forces. The Union's one regular Engineer Company was enlarged and supplemented with three new companies to form the Engineer Battalion, but this unit provided only a small portion of the engineering arm for a single Federal army. Union commanders accepted specialized volunteer units to expand their engineering capabilities, and in the west, they also detailed infantry units to serve as pioneers and assist with engineering duties. Because of the northern economy and educational system, the members of the various Union volunteer engineer units and many northern infantrymen had some mechanical aptitude. Lacking similar resources, the Confederacy never had enough engineers. Army buttresses this point by identifying a pattern of Confederate failure and improvisational Union success in early engineering operations. In the west, the Confederacy's insufficiency of engineers led to the poor position of Fort Henry on the Tennessee River, while the ingenuity of northern volunteer engineers was demonstrated when they devised an apparatus to cut trees below the waterline of a bayou in order to open a canal across a bend in the Mississippi and bypass Island No. 10. Similarly, a failure of Confederate mapmakers during the 1862 Peninsula Campaign cost Joseph Johnston an opportunity to benefit from George McClellan's division of his army across the Chickahominy River at the Battle of Seven Pines. James Longstreet's Confederate corps took the wrong road, snarled up Johnston's advance, and deprived the southern attack of much of its intended force. In the same engagement, however, the ingenuity of Union soldiers saved Erasmus Keyes' IV Corps. Before the battle Federal engineers had built several bridges over the river, and two more, Sumner's Upper and Lower bridges, were improvised by volunteer infantry regiments from Edwin Sumner's II Corps. As Army points out, Sumner's Upper Bridge was critical in moving reinforcements from Sumner's corps to shore up the hard-pressed IV Corps during the battle, although the author neglects to mention that Sumner's Lower Bridge collapsed and could not be used. While astute readers will wish that the positions of these two improvised structures had not been <u>reversed</u> on the map Army provides (123), his claim for the significance of one of them still stands.</p><p>Army also applies his argument to railroad management. Drawing on northern experiences with larger complex railroads managed by delegating authority to competent subordinates, the Union took control of critical lines in 1862. The United States Military Railroads under Daniel McCallum provided oversight and minimized the chaos previously caused by the interference of military officers. Appointed to assist McCallum, Herman Haupt laid the foundation for the United States Construction Corps by assigning men from infantry units to maintain and repair the railroad on the basis of their prewar occupations. Without the same antebellum tradition of railroad management or a similar pool of skilled labor, Army argues, the Confederacy could not create an efficient organization to manage its rail lines.</p><p>Federal military forces also improved their field engineering organizations in 1862, following the lead of William Rosecrans. When he assumed command of the Army of the Cumberland that fall, Rosecrans had only two regular engineer officers and a handful of volunteer engineer troops. His first innovation was in mapping; Rosecrans assigned non-engineering volunteer officers to collect topographical information and forward it to Captain Nathaniel Michler, the regular topographical engineer on his staff. This expanded Michler's ability to produce maps for field operations. Likewise, Rosecrans had his other regular engineer, Captain James Morton, organize permanent pioneer brigades by detailing soldiers with mechanical skills from each regiment. This allowed the general to quickly augment his engineering force. All of this was possible, according to Army, because northern volunteers had sufficient mechanical knowledge to be rapidly converted into a close approximation of military engineers. This argument, however, could have been further refined by clearly acknowledging Rosecrans's engineering background. Instead, Army implies on page 73 that he was one of many prewar officers who served in non-engineering branches or picked up technical skills during a civilian career when, in fact, Old Rosy served in the antebellum Corps of Engineers for a dozen years. Nevertheless, the author's contention that by the end of 1862 Union military leadership had recognized the engineering potential of their volunteers and established an organization to tap that potential remains valid.</p><p>In the final section, the author explores the impact of the Union's engineering capability on the major campaigns from 1863 through 1865. He finds that the previously established pattern continued; the Confederacy could not match Union technical improvisation. For instance, during Lee's withdrawal after Gettysburg, his army was delayed ten days while southern engineers cobbled together a bridge over the Potomac. Lee had earlier refused to combine the pioneer companies of his army's divisions into a dedicated engineer regiment because, Army writes, he ""believed it was impracticable to get an engineer regiment into combat"" (217). That is somewhat misleading. Lee was worried that a large engineer regiment would be less efficient in combat, but he also feared that if pioneer companies were removed from their divisions to form a larger unit, his division commanders would draw more men from infantry regiments to create new divisional pioneer companies, reducing the army's fighting force (OR, series 1, vol. 27, pt. 3, 1017). Lee's concerns suggests that it may not necessarily have been a lack of <u>skilled</u> manpower that disadvantaged the Confederacy in engineering operations. Perhaps it was just the disparity in <u>overall</u> manpower that gave northern leaders the <u>opportunity</u> to create dedicated, if improvised, engineering units, an opportunity, as Army clearly demonstrates, of which they took full advantage. </p> <p>Moreover, additional consideration of the Overland and Petersburg campaigns might have further refined Army's largely negative view of Confederate technical innovation. Instead, his treatment of these operations is limited by his concentration on the logistical consequences of military engineering. His discussion of the Overland Campaign focuses almost exclusively on Grant's movements, even though Earl Hess has concluded in <i>Trench Warfare under Grant and Lee</i>  that the expanded use of field fortifications in this campaign was first improvised by Confederate officers and men in response to Grant's policy of continuous contact. Similarly, Army neglects most of the engineering-related operations around Petersburg, except for events leading to the Battle of the Crater. In the neglected operations, however, at least one Confederate soldier improvised a method of detecting Federal mining activity. While not critical to the campaign, such action suggests the type of bottom-up innovation that the author finds lacking among Confederate forces (Hess, <i>In the Trenches at Petersburg</i>, 112). </p><p>Thomas Army Jr. has produced an interesting and thought-provoking study of military engineering in the Civil War with which students of the war, logistics, and technology will have to reckon. While his ultimate conclusion that the Union's engineering advantage was the critical reason for northern victory is still open for debate, he has launched what looks to be a profitable and enjoyable discussion, one that could benefit from a similar analysis of the well-known Confederate naval innovations such as the submarine, torpedo boat, and ironclad. </p><p><i>Mark A.

6525	9780674545731	$39.95	Preparing for War: The Emergence of the Modern U.S. Army, 1815-1917		Clark, J.P.			"War! What is it Good For? - Professional Reform	<p>War birthed the United States and the nation has rarely stopped fighting since its inception. During the long nineteenth century, the U.S. stumbled through the War of 1812 against its former colonial ruler, increased its territorial possessions via westward and foreign conquest, preserved national union through Civil War, and tasted industrial slaughter during World War I. War's centrality to U.S. history has led to a growing body of scholarship examining the nation's preparation for mass violence. This literature often treats war colleges and military academies as primary sites of historical inquiry into the institutional indoctrination of specific professional values, training, and education. J.P. Clark breaks from a normative measure of military professionalism. He instead charts new conceptual ground to alter our understanding of the U.S. Army's professionalization.</p>	<p>Clark's work is not about military professionalism, but rather military professionalisms. He divides the Army men of the nineteenth century into four successive generations (foundational, Civil War, composite, and progressive) distinguished not by their age, but instead by military experience and societal influence. His primary analytical focus is on moments of armed conflict and the often-divergent lessons military thinkers drew from experiencing the same war. Because Army officers drew differing conclusions from battle, efforts to better prepare for the next war by reforming academy curricula, training practices, and organizational structure regularly faced heated debate and resistance. One generation's pursuit of a new form of professionalism through military reform presented a threat to another generation's entrenched practices and career trajectories. Clark suggests the intergenerational conflicts and differing experiences of the nineteenth century's Army parallels the service's contemporary division between senior officers formed by the Cold War and junior officers molded by the War on Terror.</p>  	<p>Clark dubs the first of four generations of Army professionals the ""foundational"" generation. Exemplified by Winfield Scott, the men in this generation were veterans of the War of 1812 and subsequent West Point graduates serving during the antebellum period. Scott repeatedly witnessed the incompetence and cowardice of militia troops during the War of 1812. He aimed to remedy the Army's deficiencies with a tactical manual wedded to Napoleonic line tactics that required discipline and coordination. Scott favored technical skill fostering an elitist hierarchy within the foundational Army that elevated engineering and ordinance officers above those in the infantry and cavalry. This practice contrasted the relatively egalitarian spirit of the Jacksonian era. Jacksonian politics, however, heavily impacted the Army's officer corps as politicians doled out commissions as forms of patronage. The anti-intellectualism of the Jacksonian era also shined through the foundational generation's belief that ""military genius"" was an inherent trait of an individual, rather than something learnable. This disposition to education, combined with typical service conditions of small territorial detachment nearly devoid of opportunities to rise in rank, contributed to a perception that ""there was little need for elaborate systems of professional training or education.""(5)</p>	<p>The Civil War's massive mobilization of men, materiel demand, and cost in lives created a sharp break from the foundational generation's military experience. Clark centers Emory Upton in his narration and analysis of the Civil War's ramifications upon a new generation of Army professionals. During the Civil War, Upton regularly distinguished himself in combat and rapidly rose to the rank of brigadier general at the young age of twenty-four. His success in battle was in part due to his extensive operational planning and the continuous training he imposed upon the volunteer soldiers under his command. Upton's most significant realization during the Civil War was that neither the generals in command, nor their supporting staff, were qualified for their positions. Upton railed against politicians or political appointees in command. Other incompetent officers were simply products of an Army institution that had previously seen little need for preparing them for large command, organization, or to teach tactics to an untrained volunteer force. Upton's post-war career shifted from the battlefield to military education and writing. He served as the Commandant of West Point then taught at other military schools while publishing on the need for Army reform. Upton advocated merit-based promotion, a War College devoted to strategic theorizing not simply tactical proficiency, educational reform to prepare officers for generalship, and the creation of a general staff system mirroring Germany's model of well-trained and rigorously selected commanders.</p>  	<p>Unfortunately for Upton, his reform measures faced opposition for decades. Clark's ""composite"" generation consists of Civil War regulars that stayed in service and new enlistees through 1889. Clark characterizes this generation by its variance in experience and thinking. Many officers that entered service after the Civil War attended West Point while Upton was Commandant. This experience led some to support his reform initiatives. However, the Army's commanding generals during the three decades following the Civil War -- William T. Sherman, Philip H. Sheridan, and John M. Schofield -- were all among the top commanders by the war's conclusion and did not share Upton's negative perception of wartime leadership. Rather than recognizing institutional flaws within the Army as Upton did, these members of the Civil War generation considered their personal war-time performances more than proficient and blamed others' mistakes on individual incompetence. For these commanding generals, the Civil War ""served as an intellectual tether limiting how far the profession could stray from past forms."" (129)</p>  <p>Clark insists none of the three commanding generals were unthinking conservatives resisting change. Sherman commissioned Upton's work and agreed with some of his arguments. But with the Army's size dramatically reduced after the Civil War, and its primary function returned to its antebellum role of territorial constabulary, few considered it necessary to adopt Upton's proposed reforms and prepare for a large war. Reforms were attempted, but not seriously pursued. Examinations testing officers' competence generally failed to cull those who failed, as many still considered battlefield performance the only true measure of a soldier. Schofield proved the most open-minded of the three Civil War generals commanding the post-Civil War Army. He created the officers lyceum tasking officers to draft research projects concerning professional issues within the Army. However, Schofield failed to support this experiment into intellectual work with additional instruction in producing meaningful military scholarship. Michael F. Steele, a bookish officer and critic of the lyceum, quipped most officers' essays amounted to ""a constipation of ideas in a flux of words."" (136)</p><p>Substantive reform in the Uptonian vein finally came during the ""Progressive"" generation. During the Spanish American War, the U.S. Army struggled to mobilize and equip troops, highlighting the lack of a general staff devoted to pre-war planning. Elderly and physically unfit officers led their troops to disaster on the battlefield. The Army's ill-discipline horrifically and controversially emerged in the Philippines through its use of the ""water cure"" and indiscriminate violence to quell guerilla resistance. The prevalence of death from disease further fueled public perceptions of Army incompetence. Clark contrasts the Army's poor performance with that of the U.S. Navy, which had instituted extensive educational and professional reforms that proved effective during the war.</p>  <p>The Spanish-American War's numerous problems spurred public outcry and official response. The negative findings of the Dodge commission's investigations led President McKinley to appoint Elihu Root, a corporate lawyer devoid of military experience, as Secretary of War. The Root reforms reflected the Republican Progressive's commitment to the efficient power of proper organization. After compelling political machinations detailed by Clark, Root's legislative efforts created a General Staff, reorganized the National Guard, and followed Upton's suggested modifications to the Army's promotion and education systems. Clark argues the progressive generation's embrace of organization, centralization, and specialization led to dramatically improved military performance during the First World War. While Clark largely celebrates the Army's progress, he notes servicemen traded individualism for professional indoctrination. Clark rightly notes that despite the immense destruction demonstrated by industrial war, Army doctrine still improperly claimed the skill of the infantryman could reign supreme over machine guns, tanks, and artillery.</p>	<p>Clark has done a wonderful job analyzing Army reformers' efforts to revise educational and organizational structures to better prepare for war. Yet his work leaves notable gaps. Unlike Peter Karsten's study of the Annapolis Naval Academy in The Naval Aristocracy or Edward M. Coffman's analysis of transitionary twentieth century Army professionalism in The Regulars, Clark does not substantively engage with race, class, or gender as analytical categories. At some moments these analytics could improve his work and their absences are problematic. For instance, he engages in detailed operational history during the War of 1812, Civil War, and Spanish American War as supporting evidence for the need to reform Army institutions. Yet the horrific details of Army action motivated by racial hatred during wars against Native Americans receive scant attention. Clark could have treated Army racism as evidence of lacking professionalism that exemplified ill-discipline, incited violent response, and evoked negative public reaction.</p>  	<p>Clark does attend to the Army's engagement in indiscriminate warfare through the targeting of Native American foodstuffs when enforcing Andrew Jackson's 1830 Indian Removal Act. He does so primarily to contrast Winfield Scott, who found the act ""professionally unappealing,"" to other officers who followed Jackson's request to starve the natives. (44) What most shocked this reviewer was Clark's reference in this section to British officer C.E. Callwell's Small Wars: Their Principles and Practice as an ""impressive and useful book"" that might have aided Army conquest if it existed decades prior to its 1896 publication. (43) It is difficult to stomach praise for Callwell's Small Arms, a work that drew from Britain's numerous experiences in quelling rebellious native societies to delineate the best tactics for imperial powers to follow, while rationalizing acts then and now considered war crimes through an argument of civilizational difference and racial savagery. Clark's mention of Callwell's work when discussing events prior to its publication, then failure to analyze the source in its more relevant context of U.S. anti-guerilla action in the Philippines, is particularly confusing considering his recognition of other foreign influences on Army policy and his close readings of other important works of military tactics and policy.</p>  	<p>Occasionally, Army officers derided their peers that showed a particular interest in study and writing as a ""book soldier"" in contrast to a fighter. Clark highlights this divide when discussing the confrontation over academy curriculum and training between two members of his composite generation, Eben Swift and Arthur L. Wagner. The latter wrote extensively in the Uptonian vein advocating educational reform. The denigration of Wagner as an effete soldier appears an ideal moment to consider how differing Army professionalisms became wound up within conceptions of masculinity, but Clark does not analyze the conflict in this manner. Wagner's story becomes even more interesting during the Spanish American War when he desperately attempted to overcome his bookish reputation by serving in the field. This desire of the dedicated professional student of war raises a broader question ignored by Clark, but often discussed in the literature on military professionalism: Does military professionalism and careerism foster a desire among soldiers to practice their violent craft?</p>  <p>Clark is an active duty Army officer who previously served as a Pentagon strategist and history professor at West Point. Though there are gaps left in our understanding of nineteenth- century Army professionalization, Clark has produced a valuable work that will appeal to military historians, particularly those interested in the Civil War's legacy on Army education and organization.</p> <p><i>Garrett McKinnon is a PhD student at Duke University studying United States history.

6346	9780806149110	$29.95	The Civil War Years in Utah: The Kingdom of God and the Territory That Did Not Fight		Maxwell, John Gary			"Were Brigham Young and the Mormons Confederate Sympathizers?<p>Historians do it all the time: they write about the American Civil War without any mention of Utah Territory. This is not necessarily an unreasonable omission. Depending upon who you ask, Utah's importance in the actual prosecution of the war between the Union and the Confederacy ranges between marginal and non-existent. No battles were fought within the territorial boundaries between the two belligerent forces and the Mormon cavalry company that patrolled the western telegraph lines completed their assignment without a single casualty. </p> <p>Still, if you look beyond the immediate logistics of the war between north and south -- that is, if you look west -- then territories such as Utah figured prominently into the war's myriad objectives. After all, establishing control over the political, economic, and social development of the western territories was a significant objective for Abraham Lincoln and other Union leaders in the sectional struggle that culminated in the war. Yet, even when historians consider the importance of the western territories in the Civil War, Utah still stands out. Its white population was largely comprised of Mormon men and women who had just over a decade earlier settled in the area as they fled the United States, a country they felt had denied them their rights to worship according to the dictates of their own consciences. When the treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo placed the Mormons once more within the geographical jurisdiction of the United States government, tension and distrust characterized the relationship between federal officials and the Mormons' leader, Brigham Young. Thus, when war erupted at Fort Sumter, South Carolina, Utah's loyalty to the Union was uncertain. </p><p>In his book, <i>The Civil War Years in Utah</i>, John Gary Maxwell examines the impact Utah had on the Civil War and, in turn, the impact the Civil War had on Utah. Maxwell argues that ""the Society of Saints [Mormons] contributed almost nothing to the preservation of national unity and the abolition of slavery,"" and that Utah's Mormons ""were equipped, ready, and willing to engage in open warfare against the territory's parent government from 1857 to at least 1865 in order to establish their Kingdom of God on earth"" (15-16). In essence, Maxwell asserts that the Mormons in Utah Territory were Confederate sympathizers, if not covert collaborators of the seceding southern states. </p><p>Maxwell cites five key pieces of evidence for his claims. First, Maxwell points readers to an 1832 prediction of Joseph Smith now canonized in the <i>Doctrine and Covenants</i> of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints that ""beginning at the rebellion of South Carolina"" the Southern States shall be divided against the Northern States, and the Southern States will call on other nations, even the nation of Great Britain"" in order to defend themselves against other nations"""" and that this war between the states would spark wars throughout the world until the widespread violence brought about ""a full end of nations,"" which would be replaced by the Kingdom of God (xii; <i>Doctrine and Covenants</i>, section 87). Accordingly, Maxwell observes that Utah Mormons saw the Civil War and the destruction of the United States as an inevitable part of God's plan for the moral redemption of mankind. Second, Brigham Young -- who was never one to mince words -- frequently made his distrust of the United States government publicly known and on some occasions went so far as to declare his hope that defeat in the Civil War would bring divine punishment upon the U.S. government for its treatment of the Mormons during the 1840s and 1850s. Third, Young and other Mormon leaders maintained tense relationships with federal officials in Utah, and Young intentionally obstructed the firm establishment of federal authority in that territory. Fourth, Maxwell presents recently-surfaced allegations from the nineteenth century that the American adventurer Walter Murray Gibson was a confederate spy while he served as a Mormon missionary. Fifth, Maxwell demonstrates that while the <i>Union Vedette</i>, the Salt Lake City newspaper published by the California volunteers stationed at Fort Douglas, celebrated major Union victories leading up to, and including, Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox Courthouse, the church's <i>Deseret News</i> was absolutely silent on these events. </p><p>Maxwell's book is certainly provocative, but its claims are based on a heavily skewed reading of surviving sources. The rhetoric of Brigham Young and other Mormon leaders was often hostile and, at times, it certainly bordered on treason. Yet, for all the invective he aimed at the federal government, when it came time to strike deals that maintained the place of the Mormons (and Utah) in the Union, Young compromised. Similarly, as much as Mormon leaders' language condemned the United States for condoning their mistreatment and for fostering a spirit of violent persecution that resulted in the 1844 murder of their founder, every time the Confederacy invited the Mormons to join their secessionist movement, the Mormons declined. Indeed, on at least three documented occasions, representatives from the Confederacy offered the Mormons a place in their break-away country and were rebuffed by Young. </p><p>As Maxwell avers, Mormons did believe Smith's 1832 prophecy that an outbreak of violence in South Carolina would culminate in the dissolution of nations across the globe, but the immediacy with which they anticipated the realization of this prediction is unclear. It is certainly possible that Young and the Mormons believed the Civil War would bring about the end of all nations and usher in the millennial reign of Jesus Christ during their lifetime. Furthermore, Maxwell may even be correct in his speculation that news of Union victory -- rather than the hoped for destruction of Union and Confederacy alike -- disappointed the Mormons and explains the absence of celebratory headlines of Union success in the <i>Deseret News</i>. But to claim that Mormon anticipation of the Civil War bringing about the end of <i>all</i> nations proves Mormon willingness to aid a secession effort that, if successful, would result in the sustained existence of <i>two</i> nations is a stretch of fact and reason. </p><p>There is also an unfortunate inconsistency in the quality of Maxwell's historical sources. While he makes great use of Utah's territorial newspapers and other archival materials housed in repositories located in the greater Salt Lake City area, he also relies heavily on Wikipedia. It is a bit disconcerting to discover dozens of citations to this open-sourced website in a book published by an academic press. It also suggests an unevenness in Maxwell's grasps of the relevant sources, which at times is quite thorough. </p><p>The value of Maxwell's <i>The Civil War Years in Utah</i> lies primarily in the sources he collects and the provocative questions he poses. These sources need more scholarly attention and these questions certainly deserve deeper consideration from historians. Furthermore, he adds his voice -- as well as his fluid and engaging prose style -- to others who call for a more expansive geographic perspective of the Civil War, its causes, and its impact, a perspective that moves beyond the traditional north-south dichotomy. Yet, Maxwell's book falls short in its extreme claims of the Mormons' motives and designs during the war -- claims that are exposed as little more than unfounded theories when considered within the full breadth of sources documenting the history of Utah during the Civil War years. In aiming for provocative and spectacular conclusions, Maxwell missed an opportunity to turn historians' attention to more nuanced and revelatory conclusions on what the strained and unpredictable relationship between Mormon leaders and the federal government during this era tells us about the debated status of western territories, marginalized people, and federal authority in nineteenth-century American history.</p><p><i>Spencer W.

6565	9781469630519	$34.95	A More Civil War: How the Union Waged a Just War		Dilbeck, D.H.			"Were the Union's War Policies Legal and Moral? <p>In this work the author seeks to explain the ""strange paradox of the Civil War: It occasioned both great destruction and remarkable restraint."" (p. 3) Based on extensive research in primary and secondary sources, he concludes that the U.S. Army fought the Confederacy in a manner that was hard yet humane.</p> <p>This book provides a useful overview of the moral and legal issues faced by Union officers during the Civil War. One weakness is that its evidence is largely limited to general orders and directives from the upper reaches of the Union military hierarchy -- Army, Corps and Division commanders, as well as the War Department. Little evidence is offered on whether private soldiers followed these orders in the field. In the one chapter where the author examines soldier behavior, the evidence is not very encouraging.</p> <p>April, 1863, was a key turning point in the development of U.S. policy. In that month the War Department issued General Orders # 100, entitled ""Instructions for the Government of Armies of the United States in the Field."" This Order, mainly drafted by Dr. Francis Lieber of Columbia University, was the U.S. Army's first official guidance on the laws and customs of war. Commonly referred to as the Lieber Code, the author devotes a chapter to this important document, and frequently applies it as the standard for assessing the legitimacy of the Union's actions.</p><p>The rest of the book is organized in a roughly chronological manner, reflecting the new challenges Union officers faced in the course of the war. The chapter examining 1861-62 Union responses to guerrilla warfare in Missouri is followed by chapters discussing occupation policy in Memphis and New Orleans in 1862, retaliation against Confederate prisoners of war in 1863 and the treatment of hostile civilians by General Sherman's forces in 1864.</p><p>The author concedes that U.S. anti-guerrilla policy was ""messy,"" and no general pattern of development is evident. Nevertheless, he believes that humane elements can be detected. For example, the practice of punishing the civilian population for nearby guerrilla incidents was sometimes curtailed, and military commission trials were required before captured guerrillas or disloyal civilians were punished. Nevertheless, responses to guerrilla actions tended to follow a general trajectory toward harder, less humane measures. On September 18, 1862, for example, at Palmyra Missouri, General John McNeil ordered the execution of ten Confederate guerrillas in retaliation for the capture (and probable execution) of a Missouri Unionist by Rebel guerrillas. Almost a year later, on August 25, 1863, Union General Thomas Ewing ordered the complete depopulation of four counties in Northwestern Missouri in response to guerrilla activity. Both secessionist and Unionist families were forced to move. Ewing's order was repealed after several months, but the damage had been done by then. The author discusses neither of these incidents.</p> <p>The Lieber Code labeled retaliation ""the sternest feature of war,"" and urged restraint and caution before carrying out retaliatory punishments. The book argues that the Union followed Lieber's advice when considering retaliatory actions against Confederate prisoners of war. The author notes that threats of retaliation against prisoners in response to Confederate abuse of African American troops were never carried out, and that cuts in rations at prisoner of war camps, in response to suspected starvation of Union prisoners, were quite moderate.</p> <p>The examples cited are limited to decisions at the highest levels of the U.S. government; reprisals against prisoners of war were more common at lower levels of command. In 1862, for example, General George B. McClellan regarded Confederate use of land mines to be treacherous, and in retaliation forced prisoners of war to clear them. General Sherman followed the same policy on land mines during the 1864 Savannah campaign. During his 1865 Carolina campaign, Sherman executed several Confederate prisoners in retaliation for the murder of Union soldiers captured by Confederate General Wade Hampton's forces.</p> <p>The chapter on how hard-war policies affected civilians concentrates on General Sherman's campaigns in Georgia and the Carolinas, and Sheridan's campaign in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia. For this chapter, the author has done extensive research in the letters and journals of ordinary soldiers, supplementing the orders issued by Sherman and his subordinate generals. While the official orders are consistent with the Lieber Code, it is not well reflected in the behavior recorded by private soldiers. The Code consistently denounced acts carried out wantonly or for revenge, without a valid military purpose. Yet the soldiers themselves recorded multiple examples of pillage and the destruction of buildings without official authorization. Arguing that these campaigns were nevertheless hard but humane war, the author again focuses on the repeated official warnings that such acts were forbidden, while conceding that these warnings were often ignored by the common soldiers.</p><p><i>Burrus M.

6520	9781574416510	$29.95	Women in Civil War Texas: Diversity and Dissidence in the Trans-Mississippi		Ed. Liles, Deborah M.	Ed. Boswell, Angela		"""A Long Way from Tara""<p>This anthology addresses a neglected aspect of Texas Civil War historiography, the experiences of women during the conflict. Co-editors Deborah Liles and Angela Boswell are well qualified for their task, with combined backgrounds in Texas, Southern, Women's, and Civil War history. The authors they have included, in turn, provide a broad perspective on the lives of women swept up in events beyond their control and the wide variety of their responses to such circumstances.</p><p>Like their compatriots throughout the Confederacy, Texan women faced multiple hardships during the war, although not as passive victims. The first chapter, by Vicki Betts, demonstrates that women actively promoted secession and supported recruitment. Others assumed duties outside their traditional gender roles as circumstances compelled them to take on the responsibilities of absentee husbands and fathers. Dorothy Ewing illustrates this reality through a biographical sketch of Caroline Sedberry, wife of a Texas politician and Confederate army officer. In his absence, Mrs. Sedberry was forced to manage their farm, negotiating the family's business while still attending to all the traditional work expected of nineteenth--century women. Other authors also argue that many women clung to activities such as letter writing and organizing patriotic festivities and solemn commemorations to maintain some semblance of normality amid the chaos of war.</p><p>One of the book's major strengths emphasizes that the Confederate States were no more completely unified than the United States; not all women shared allegiance to ""the cause,"" and their lives differed markedly from those of Southern loyalists. Black women -- the vast majority of them enslaved -- are the subject of two excellent chapters. Both Bruce Glasrud's ""Black Women and the Freedom War"" and Linda Hudson's ""Black Women and Supreme Court Decisions during the Civil War Era"" constitute important contributions to the study of African Americans' experiences of the conflict. Three more chapters speak to the difficulties of Unionists attempting to survive in Confederate Texas. Mexican-Texas women, for example, faced suspicions regarding their ethnicity as well as their loyalty, according to Jerry Thompson and Elizabeth Mata. Those living on the frontier had a particularly hard time, Judith Dykes-Hoffman points out, living under constant threat of attack by ""bushwhackers, scalawags and outlaws,"" (188), as well as raiding Comanches. Similarly, Home Guard and partisan units in North Texas murdered violators of Confederate conscription laws and those even suspected of Union loyalties. Candice N. Shockley writes that by the war's waning days, even elite refugees fleeing the Yankee armies from other besieged states to Texas' comparative calm were seen as disloyal and a burden on the population, writes Candice N Shockley.</p><p>This is a strong collection of essays, although a few weaknesses exist. In an apparent copyediting error, the reference notes for the introduction fall out of sequence, beginning on page 3. Fortunately this is not the case in subsequent chapters. The quality of the prose varies from chapter to chapter, a characteristic of most anthologies. And while some these essays -- those by Glasrud, Hudson, and Shockley, for example -- contribute significantly to the scholarship of Civil War Texas, others are more derivative,  confirming previous, general studies of women in the Confederacy with specifically Texan examples. Nevertheless, this book remains a useful and long overdue examination of women's experiences in Civil War Texas, whether as a general introduction to the topic or a potential source for deeper inquiry.</p><p><i>Texas A&M University -- Kingsville                                                          Roger H.
