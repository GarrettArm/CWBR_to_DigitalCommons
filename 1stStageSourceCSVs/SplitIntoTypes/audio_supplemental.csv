Interviewed by Christopher Childers</h3>
<p>
<p>
<b><i>Civil War Book Review (CWBR):</i></b>   You begin your latest book with the phrase ""Jefferson Davis by William Cooper, once again,"" of course referring to your 2000 biography ""Jefferson Davis, American.""  But why Jefferson Davis in the first place, what lead you to study this man?</p>
<p>
<b><i>William J. Cooper, Jr. (WJC):</i></b>  I've been interested in Davis for a long time.  When I was a senior in college, I wrote my senior thesis on the Confederate strategy at the end of the war in the West from Atlanta to Bentonville, and of course Davis was a major character, and that and I went to graduate school and I thought about Jefferson Davis and my advisor told me that Davis was too complicated for a graduate student to write a biography about, but I could pick a portion of his life like ""Jefferson Davis, Secretary of War.""  This seemed to me to be about as dull as you could get.  So I went in a totally different direction, and I ended up writing about antebellum politics.  But Davis was interesting to me and always in my mind.  Nobody ever wrote the biography of Davis that everyone turned to.  I became a dean in the 1980s and when I finished that I was looking around and I said to myself, ""This is the time.  If you are ever going to give it a shot, give it a shot.""  And so I decided to try it.  At that time the Jefferson Davis Papers project at Rice University was made open to me-- earlier in my career they had a less than open door policy to let people come in.  And so I decided to take a shot at it.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> This collection of essays focuses sharply on Davis the politician and Davis as the commander-in-chief of the Confederate States of America.  And you characterize Davis as the ""consummate antebellum politician,"" a man who intimately understood politics as ""a means to an end,"" and he worked to achieve his goals through deliberation and compromise.  Was Davis representative of the ordinary southern politician? How did he differ from his colleagues?</p>
<p>
<b><i>WJC:</i></b>  I don't think he did differ from his successful colleagues.  I could rattle you off a half dozen more names, but Davis has generally been depicted as a person who was not a politician; a man who was the antithesis of the politician, and this depiction did not simply deal with the Confederate States of America, though it centered on his role as president.  But before that he was most often characterized in the historiography as a person who was stiff-necked, who was unbending, who as his wife said, ""didn't know the arts of a politician and wouldn't practice them if he knew them.""  And my research indicated to me that he was a very different kind of person.   I don't think he was that kind of stiff-necked, unbending man; I think he was a professional politician and he was really good at what he did.</p>  
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b>  Keeping in the vein of politics here, you say in this book, definitely, Davis played a critical role in the opposition of the Compromise of 1850, yet as you also note, this didn't mean that Davis opposed compromise, <i>per se</i>.  Why did he oppose the plan from 1850?  And what would he have preferred?</p>
<p>
<b><i>WJC:</i></b>  Well he opposed the plan for 1850 chiefly because of California.  Bringing in California as a free state would end the balance in the Senate.  There would be 16 free states rather than 15, and the slave states would remain at 15.  He saw southern power in the Senate as absolutely critical in maintaining southern power in the nation.  And he followed Calhoun.  Calhoun believed that you had to have political power to maintain your position in the United States even if your position was based on views of the constitution.  So Davis believed that California coming in would disrupt the balance and would weaken southern power.  He also objected because California was being handled a way differently from any preceding territory becoming a state.  It was done so quickly with no territorial phase, which would eliminate any possibility for Southerners to participate in its settlement.  That’s why he opposed the Compromise of 1850 so desperately. </p>
<p> 
What he preferred and what he had supported and voted for in 1848 was to extend the Missouri Compromise line.  He also voted in 1848 for the proposal that would turn the question of slavery and the territories of to the federal judiciary—the so-called Clayton proposal, which like the Missouri Compromise extension, passed the Senate, but failed in the House.  He supported both of those, because he thought those were dividing the question, giving the South a fair chance;  whereas he thought the Compromise of 1850, with California as the headlight, didn't give the South a chance and broke equality.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b>  Davis urged caution during the secession crisis and he didn't support immediate secession.  Did southerners ever question Davis's suitability for the Confederate presidency based on his support—albeit qualified—of the Union?</p>
<p>
<b><i>WJC:</i></b> Well, not really I don't think.  There may have been a few radicals who thought Davis had been too conservative, but not for most Southerners.  He was not like Alexander Stephens, who had actually opposed secession at the Georgia secession convention.  Once it became clear that Mississippi was down the road to secession, Davis said fine.  When he was in Jackson, in November 1860 at the meeting of the congressional delegation for the governor to make his decision on how to approach the legislature and the crisis, Davis opposed immediate action and he told the governor this.  But when Davis left that meeting to go to Washington, he made it very clear that what Mississippi decided was where he would go.  When he first got to Washington in December, he was very dismayed and very depressed and didn't think there was any chance that any kind of compromise, and then his spirits lifted a bit at mid-month. As he said, he didn't really give up on the Union, until the failure of the Committee of Thirteen in the Senate.  But he was not looked upon as somebody who had really opposed secession, like Alexander Stephens.  He was looked upon as a moderate, and that was terrifically important, especially to people in the Upper South states.  People in states like Virginia had informed some of those who were going out that they needed to put in a moderate man like Davis.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> Now you certainly make clear too that Davis has held firm loyalties to the Union.  Yet you also note that early on in the war Davis wanted to make, ""the enemy know firsthand that the sting of war.""  How would you describe Davis's feelings toward northerners, and toward bringing the war to them?  And then, how did Davis's outlook harden over the course of the war years?</p>
<p>
<b><i>WJC:</i></b>  In the beginning, what Davis wanted was for the Confederacy to be left alone, but he didn't really think that was going to happen.  He didn't believe the North would let the South go without a struggle, and he foresaw a very long and difficult struggle.  At the same time, I don't think Davis had any enmity toward Northerners, <i>per se</i>.  He began to have a real antipathy toward the Lincoln administration because of what he saw as a harsh war policy. Confederate territory came into Union hands in 1861 and from then on every month, every week almost, more and more fell.  What he saw was not only Union armies pushing Confederate armies back or overrunning Confederate forces, but he saw buildings burned, he saw people put on the road as refugees, he saw a war against civilians.  And then, of course, when the Union army began to employ blacks that, in the South, that raised a specter that haunted Southerners for generations—the idea of race war. He saw the Emancipation Proclamation as an utterly brutal act that endangered southern civilians, particularly women and children.  By 1862, when the South had been invaded, and he saw what he called this brutality, and what modern historians call the hard War, he wanted the North defeated.  He wanted northern civilians to know what they were perpetrating on the South, and the only reason northern civilians didn't feel it was because he didn't have the wherewithal to make them feel it.</p>
<p>
<b><i.CWBR:</i></b> You argue in this book that Davis saw the fight for the Confederacy as a ""holy mission.""  The Union had failed and so the principles of 1776 had to be secured through a “revolution against politics"" as George Rable has put it.  Did Jefferson Davis foresee an eventual return to a more traditional form of politics or would fealty to the Confederacy always amount to a ""holy mission"" even after independence had been gained?</p>
<p>
<b><i>WJC:</i></b>  I can't answer that.  His great goal was to have an independent Confederacy.  If the Confederacy had in fact won its independence, none of us knows what would have happened.  I simply can't answer that question, but he certainly believed that as long as the Confederacy was in balance that the old politics had to disappear.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b>  You argue that as the conflict progressed, political concerns dominated Davis's strategic thinking, again linking the idea of politics and war aims.  To what extent did these concerns about politics hamper the Confederate war effort?</p>
<p>
<b><i>WJC:</i></b>  I don't think that he got more concerned about the political aspects of the war as the war progressed.  I think that was in the forefront from the very beginning.  I argue that Fort Sumter was his first great political strategic act, because Fort Sumter was a political act more than a military act in my judgment.  I think if Davis never had to concern himself with politics he might have done things differently.  But in some ways I think that’s a false question, because he himself said there was no way to separate the two.  He existed in a world in which politics had to play a part.  Probably if politics wasn't involved at all, you could say well he may have jettisoned the Trans-Mississippi early on.  He did say that it was a tough job to have politics and war at the same time.  Maybe he would have concentrated more on other issues as some of his critics said he should have done, but I'm not sure.  That’s a hard question to answer.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> You mention in the book, too, though that one of the problems that Davis faced was that he felt he had to keep troops throughout the Confederacy.</p>
<p>
<b><i>WJC:</i></b>  That's right, he did.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> And he had to do that, in your opinion, to maintain the political balance?</p>
<p>
<b><i>WJC:</i></b>  He had to do that to maintain loyalty.  Davis knew there was no Confederate nationalism in 1861.  He said on one occasion that Confederate nationalism was being created in the cauldron of war.  He looked to the Revolution.  He saw American nationalism being created in the American Revolution.  So he thought it could be done—that Confederate nationalism could be created.  But it didn't exist when the war began in his own mind, nor in mine.  He looked at portions of his country and he was told by politicians and by soldiers that in places like Arkansas, for example, that if he didn't defend Arkansas that it would probably leave the Confederacy.  And if Arkansas left who might be next?  As he explained to one of his generals, he said, ""When we give up on a place we not only lose territory, we tend to lose men as well,"" because their loyalty had not yet been secured by the Confederate government in his own eyes.  And I think he was right.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> You also discuss in here that Davis tended to be a micromanager.</p>
<p>
<b><i>WJC:</i></b> Only in one sense.  He was a micromanager in Richmond in directing the war.  He had several Secretaries of War and all but one was quite able.  But in dealing with his generals he was not a micromanager.  I argue emphatically that he was not, that in fact, he should have managed them more carefully and more closely.  When he appointed a senior general to a major post he basically left that general alone.  He might make suggestions and he did make suggestions, but he was not a micromanager of his generals in the field—not at all.  I would argue that Lincoln was much more of a micromanager over his generals in the field than Davis.  But in running the general war, letters left the War Department with the Secretary of War’s signature and with the adjutant general's signature, but all the decisions were Davis's decisions. You can look at the materials he looked at, and as president the stuff that came across his desk you can see his endorsements.  Does a piece of artillery go here or there?  He liked to talk to his Secretaries of War and would have long conversations with them.  He wanted them to talk and he wanted their opinions, but he made the final decision on almost everything.  But once appointed somebody as a general—even people he didn't really like very much—he left them out there to do what they would do.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b>  In Davis's estimation the Confederacy faced ""victory and liberty, or defeat and enslavement.""  Did he ever talk of defeat and enslavement, in particular, in the postbellum years?</p>
<p>
<b><i>WJC:</i></b>  No.  During the war he did say we that if we lose, we will become slaves of a horrible North.  After the war he kept very quiet about public questions, particularly because he had been imprisoned and he had never become reconciled to the new order of things in terms, for example, trying to get his citizenship back.  He refused to do that.  He realized that if he made any comments about public matters, it would only serve to hurt those he cared most about, that is, the South and the southern states.  So he didn't comment publicly on public matters.  In terms in what was happening inside the South, privately he did feel that during the Reconstruction years that the South was basically in servitude.  He applauded the end of Reconstruction; he applauded the restoration of white supremacy.  And if you look at his public speeches in the 1880s, he is not a fellow who is standing up bemoaning and lamenting.  He is looking at the future; he is talking about the future.  He says he is proud of his country.  I think that's because by 1880, he saw that the South was back in the hands of those people that he thought should have control of it.  But during Reconstruction, he never made a public comment about Reconstruction that I know of.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b>  Now in sort of the same vein, you state that Davis believed that Northerners, especially the Republicans, challenged the Americanness of the South.  Did Jefferson Davis see his ""holy crusade"" as a way to prove that Southerners were true Americans, and in Davis’s mind was the true America lost with the death of the Confederacy?</p>
<p>
<b><i>WJC:</i></b>  Davis saw the Confederacy as the true America without any question.  He believed that.  When the Confederacy failed, as Davis said toward the end of his life, many of his hopes and aspirations fell with it and his conviction about the future fell.  But then I think, as I try to argue, that by 1880 his view had changed; that he is much more optimistic, that he applauds his country.  He says that all Southerners should be proud Americans. I think he thought by the end of Reconstruction that the America he had cherished was in fact gone, but there was an America there that deserved southern loyalty and southern allegiance. And it had his loyal allegiance, though he refused to do those things that would have given him his citizenship back, because in his own mind he said, ""those people didn't have the right to take it, so I don't have the right to hold it; I'm not going to give them the opportunity to give it back to me or reject me."" You can say that was pretty stiff-necked, but that was holding to a dogma he had about the legitimacy of what he had done in 1861, its constitutionality, and the correctness of it.  But if you look at the last public address he gave to a group of young men near his home on the Mississippi coast in the last years of his life, he tells those young people that they need to look forward, that they can't be trapped by the past and they should be proud of being Americans.</p> 
 <p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> Now in your last essay you raise a really fascinating point about the creation of the Lost Cause ideology, and you mention in there that the Lost Cause ideology was based in some part on omitting slavery from the history of the Civil War.  What role did Davis play in creating that Lost Cause ideology and in trying to create it in part by omitting the idea of slavery from the causes of the Civil War?</p>
<p>
<b><i>WJC:</i></b> In that last essay, I argue that Davis had a very important role to play.  He was not young enough, as some of the men who historians normally point to as the real founders of the Lost Cause ideology, but was an older man and older generation.  If you look at his memoir, <i>The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government</i>, which was published in 1881, he specifically says in it that slavery was not the cause of war.  If you look at the remarks he made in Montgomery in 1886, which was the focus of that essay, again there is nothing said about slavery. But if you contrast those remarks with the remarks he made in Montgomery in 1861, when he was the provisional president, in both his actual inaugural address and the remarks he made in public before that in Montgomery he put slavery at the very forefront of what was going on.  So I think he was absolutely in sync, if you will, with the general thrust of southern opinion at that time that was putting slavery and race out of it. The unity of North and South was coming, was taking place and nobody wanted to talk about slavery, and Southerners certainly didn't.</p>

<h3>Interviewed by Christopher Childers</h3>
<p>
<p>
<i><b>Civil War Book Review (CWBR):</b></i> Your latest book is titled <i>""What Shall We Do with The Negro?"": Lincoln, White Racism, and Civil War America</i>. Now in this book, you attempt to revise what is really a celebratory depiction of Abraham Lincoln as the great emancipator by noting his reticence in many ways to ending the institution of slavery by force. How have historians, in your opinion, erred in chronicling Lincoln's record on the slavery issue?</p>
<p>
<b><i>Paul D. Escott (PDE):</i></b> There is a deep celebratory impulse in American popular culture in terms of the way we view our history.  And historians have been emphasizing Lincoln’s racial progressivism and racial egalitarianism, overemphasizing it I would say, quite a bit in recent decades.  This has not always been the case. There were earlier periods in American history which people praised Lincoln highly because he was considerate of white southerners and did not push for rights for black people.  But it's notable that in the last couple of decades, the emphasis on Lincoln as someone who worked for racial equality has gone a little too far. There are quite a number of things about Lincoln's policies that needed a careful reconsideration. I'll start, I think, by mentioning just a couple of them.</p>  
<p>
One would have to do with his expectation on what might follow freedom; and another might have to do with the Thirteenth Amendment and where he stood on the process of ratification for it at the end of the war.  It's well known that before Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, he had repeatedly proposed plans of gradual, compensated emancipation that could be voluntarily undertaken by the states, acting on their own. He always linked those to colonization.  What people have said less about is that after the Emancipation Proclamation was issued, he repeatedly talked about what he called temporary arrangements or apprenticeship.  Now apprenticeship may bring to mind Benjamin Franklin back in the 18th century, and we may think of it as something that would give people an opportunity to rise in society.  But that kind of apprenticeship had almost completely died out in 19th century America.  This idea of apprenticeship would be a way for slaveholders to hold onto the labor of younger slaves for a period of time.  That was always a part of his plans for gradual emancipation.  After he proposed the Emancipation Proclamation, he continued to talk about apprenticeship or temporary arrangements.</p>  
<p>
What Lincoln had in mind comes through very clearly in the letter that he wrote to General John McClernand in early 1863.  In that letter, he said to McClernand that if the southern states that are covered by the Emancipation Proclamation would adopt measures of apprenticeship, they could be nearly as well off as if this trouble had not occurred. He would be trying to provide financial aid from the federal government, and that would help them as well.  Lincoln continued to talk about apprenticeship or temporary arrangements as something that southern whites could expect once slavery came to an end.  And in his Amnesty Proclamation, the one setting up the Ten Percent Plan for reestablishing southern governments, he again talks about these temporary arrangements or apprenticeships that would be looked upon with favor by the president.  So I think that he was not expecting (and there's no evidence that he was pushing for) any drastic, immediate change in the social and political situation of black people once slavery came to an end.</p> 
<p>
What is also notable about the Thirteenth Amendment, is that although Lincoln deserves a great deal of praise for pushing Congress to propose the Thirteenth Amendment and to put in place a measure that would be a part of our Constitution to bar slavery (not just a war measure as the Emancipation Proclamation was), the prospects of ratifying the Thirteenth Amendment without force or a requirement by the executive were very troubled.  It would take ten states to block the amendment.  The Confederacy of course claimed thirteen. There were eleven southern states that had actively participated in the Confederacy.  There were also three Union states that had voted heavily Democratic in 1864, were not at all in Lincoln's camp, and were likely to oppose ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment.</p>  
<p>
Historians have not questioned that at the Hampton Roads Conference in February of 1865, William Seward told southerners about the proposal of this amendment but also mentioned that he expected it not to be approved.  Up to the very time of his death, Lincoln was still not insisting on ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment.  He was trying in various ways to offer incentives to white southerners to ratify the Thirteenth Amendment.  But he had not at all come to the point of requiring that.  And I think that that needs to be kept in mind in order for us to have a better understanding of what Lincoln's approach was and what his policy was.  He seemed very interested in first, pursuing the priority of getting the Union back together, and second, in order to do that, to offer incentives and means of conciliating white southerners so that they would participate in the process and take an active role in it, rather than be coerced into reunion.</p>  
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> You contend in this book that the true legacy of the Civil War regarding race relations is what you call ""a sobering future of segregation and racial exploitation.” And yet the answer you just gave, and in fact much of what you talk about in the book, seems to suggest that there is a continuity of racism and troubled race relations from the antebellum years to the Civil War and into the years of Reconstruction. Did the legacy of racism from the antebellum period ease in any way or do you just see a fundamental continuity over the years of the Civil War and Reconstruction?</p> 
<p>
<b><i>PDE:</i></b> I do see a tremendous amount of continuity. Racism was a very deep problem in the entire nation—North as well as South.  My last chapter points out and analyzes the action of three northern states after the war came to an end.  These states voted against proposals to let the small numbers of black people in their state vote as citizens following the end of the war. Racism did continue and there's a great deal of continuity there. The war really posed two problems or two questions.  One was: what was going to be done about slavery.  Following upon that was the next question, which many newspapers and magazines were asking, “What shall we do with the Negro?”</p>  
<p>
You can see in the way that the question was asked that it was flawed by racism.  The white people asking that question were assuming that they could dispose of the Negro problem, that they could decide what would be done with African Americans.  They weren't looking upon African Americans as members of the polity who would have a normal role to play.  It is striking that there was some change in racial attitudes in the North during the war. I was really surprised as I turned to a more careful study to the North (since most of my work had been done on the South) to see how quickly many magazines came around to the idea not only that slavery must be destroyed, but also that improvement in the status of black people needed to be undertaken.  <i>Harper’s Weekly</i> was far in advance in this regard, and quickly came to a position that the United States needed to confront its problem of racism and live up to its ideals. There also were Army officials who worked with freedmen in the South whose attitudes changed and who made recommendations that included full political rights for African Americans. Indeed many of these generals said that it would be necessary to give African Americans their political rights so that they could protect themselves against white hostility in the post-war world.  And there were others signs of discussion and some change of ideas in the North, especially before 1863.</p>  
<p>
But thereafter, in the later stages of the war, there was not as much discussion of the future status of African Americans as one would have expected.  I believe that Lincoln wanted to see slavery come to an end at some point, as I've indicated.   But even at the end of the war, he was not at the point of insisting on <i>immediate</i> emancipation for <i>all</i> of the South's slaves; he would consider some other possibilities.  Lincoln did not really do much to address this question of future status of African Americans. We do know that in his final public statements, just a few days before he was killed, he came out in favor of letting a few Africans Americans vote—those whom he called the very intelligent or those who served in the Army.  But he voiced that view simply as a personal preference, and he was at the same time, offering many conciliatory measures to white southerners.  So, though the war did address the question of slavery, it did relatively little to address the question of racism and the future status of African Americans. That was forced upon Congress during Reconstruction, but there wasn't a great deal of important ground gained on that front during the war itself. Of course, in the South, we know that there were proposals to bring slaves into the army and to free them, and there perhaps were a surprising number of white southerners who concluded that that needed to be done. Yet it's notable that the Confederate Congress absolutely refused to consider the idea of freedom for any black soldiers and was very tardy in coming around to the idea that some steps should be taken to bring slaves into the Army.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> In trying to answer the question you pose in the title, you chronicle how the Union conducted studies to decide what they should do with African Americans following the end of the war. And they actually produced some very valuable insights into how African Americans could live in the Union as productive citizens. Now, from what you've said, you suggest that Lincoln himself may not have taken much stock in that information that he received. Did other members of his administration and the cabinet receive the information about what role freedmen could possibly play in a reconstructed Union any more favorably than did Lincoln?</p> 
<p>
<b><i>PE:</i></b> Yes. Salmon Chase, the Treasury Secretary, was known as a strong advocate of abolition before the war. Chase was pushing for improvement in the situation of the slaves who had escaped from their masters in the South. But what is more surprising and really interesting, is the fact that Edwin Stanton, the Secretary of War, took a strong role here. Stanton had been a democrat, not a republican. As Secretary of War, Stanton concluded that to win the war and restore the Union, slavery would have to be destroyed.  He ended up favoring measures that led to studies and recommendations on political and civil equality for black people. Stanton, I could say, colluded a little bit with David Hunter, the general who issued a proclamation early in 1862 to free slaves in his military district.  Hunter wanted to do this, and he let Stanton know that he was planning to do it and said, in essence, ""Let me take the blame if need be."" Stanton was happy for him to go ahead and do that.  And then Stanton appointed the American Freedman’s Inquiry Commission. So the commission and various Union generals who were at work in the South gathered a lot of information about how the freedmen were fairing once they had managed to escape from slavery. They did write reports and, as you indicated, they recommended that the African Americans should be given the right to vote and should have means of protecting themselves as citizens in the polity once the war was over.</p> 
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> To what do you attribute Lincoln's reticence on emancipation on the issue of broader rights for African Americans?  How do his attitudes and opinions on slavery fit within the larger context of Republican Party politics?  In many ways, it seems that Lincoln might have drawn some of his conclusions and some of his opinions about slavery from his political idol, Henry Clay, who himself was very conflicted on the issue of slavery.</p>
<p>
<b><i>PE:</i></b> That's exactly what I was thinking as I heard you ask your question.  I do believe that Lincoln’s attitudes and ideas on policy evolved, just not nearly as far as some writers have suggested in recent decades. I believe that when the war began, his thinking was influenced a great deal by the man he called his <i>beau ideal</i>, Henry Clay.  Clay, of course, had helped to found the American Colonization Society. Lincoln’s advocacy of colonization was not accidental or trivial; he was very consistent about it and stood with it for a long time. Those who want to exalt Lincoln as a modern day paragon of equality like to point out that he did not publicly talk about colonization after January 1, 1863.  But in saying that, they ignore the fact that in March and April of that year, he entered into arrangements with some shady operators to send over four hundred African Americans to an island off Haiti in an experiment of colonization. It proved to be disastrous, and the people organizing it did not provide the support they should have, and many people died. So Lincoln did persist in this idea of investigating colonization, even after the issuance of the final Emancipation Proclamation.</p> 
<p>
Now as a Republican, Lincoln positioned himself pretty much in the middle—he was never as far advanced as those who came to be called Radical Republicans, but he was not as conservative as some of the most conservative Republicans either. But he always tried to stay on good terms with both camps, to keep all of his options open, to move slowly, and to see how the situation developed. I believe, too, that when Lincoln became president, he felt a real obligation not only to try to put the Union together but to adhere to the promises that his party had made to southerners. The platform of the Republican Party said that it respected the rights of states to determine their domestic institutions, and that slavery was not something the government should interfere with. He continually reminded people that he was trying to respect the Constitution and the rights of states.  His Emancipation Proclamation, if you recall, was issued as a war measure, under his authority as Commander-in-Chief in time of actual war.  So he was concerned, I think, to remind these southern whites that he was a reasonable person whom they could deal with, that he would be liberal in his dealings with them, and that he had not taken the role of a dedicated and bitter enemy of them and of their whole system. He wanted to bring them back into the Union on good terms. His efforts to conciliate them certainly came at the expense of the interest of African Americans in a number of ways.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> In 1864, Lincoln faced a reelection bid that even he, for a period of time, did not think that he could win. And as you discussed, the political dynamics of the time tested his resolve on the critical issues of the war and especially on emancipation. In what ways did Lincoln’s compromises on emancipation reflect his desire to win reelection and what impact did those decisions have on his policy toward African Americans after his reelection?</p>
<p>
<b><i>PDE:</i></b> Lincoln, of course, was an ambitious and practical politician, and he found himself in a real bind in the summer of 1864. In response to pleas from Horace Greeley that he meet with Confederate commissioners that Jefferson Davis had sent to Canada, Lincoln said he would be willing to talk with such commissioners, if they were empowered to end the war on the terms of putting the Union back together <i>and</i> ending slavery. The northern public at that time was discouraged by the heavy casualties that Ulysses S. Grant was incurring in Virginia and discouraged by how long the war had dragged on. There was a great revulsion in the public to hearing these words from Lincoln. People said, ""What? You’re making emancipation a condition of ending the war. That was never what you said before.” Lincoln and the Republicans had always argued that their goal was to reunite the Union, and that measures like the Emancipation Proclamation had been undertaken solely as a means to accomplish that end. So people objected and said, ""Now why have you made emancipation a condition of ending the war?"" Lincoln’s advisors and party leaders throughout the North told him that prospects were dark and that he was likely to be defeated. And he certainly believed that as well. So in response to that crisis and before the fortunes of war turned in the Union’s favor, he engaged in what I think we would see as rather typical political maneuvering.</p> 
<p>
Lincoln drafted, though he did not send, a letter that laid out the strategy. In this letter he said, in essence, ""Just because I said I would talk to these Confederates on certain terms doesn’t mean that I would refuse to talk to them if other and different terms were offered me. Let them try me."" Lincoln decided not to send that letter; I think that would have made him look like he was flip-flopping, in terminology of our day. But other members of the party put the same argument out. The <i>New York Times</i> was a notable example of this; its editor Henry Raymond was the chairman of the Republican National Committee, and he made that argument in print. Secretary of State Seward also gave a public speech in which he used language that Lincoln later repeated almost word for word in his address to Congress at the end of 1864. And it's difficult to make complete sense out of the things Lincoln said because they don’t entirely go together. On the one hand, he echoed Seward's words and said that the only thing that was necessary to bring the war to an end was for the southern states to cease their resistance. If the military resistance stopped, the war would immediately stop.  There would be no way that it would continue. Then courts and councils of legislation would decide all questions that remained regarding the future status of black people, “operating only in constitutional and lawful channels,” because the Emancipation Proclamation was merely a war measure. It's not entirely clear what Lincoln and Seward meant, but the Constitution certainly did not say anything about southern states that had seceded losing their rights. So it would seem that they would still have rights and would be involved in those processes. But Lincoln also went in the opposite direction, stating that he would not retract anything he said about emancipation and that he would not put anyone who had gained freedom back into slavery. So he engaged in a bit of double talk there.</p> 
<p>
As for how this affected the future status of black people or his policy toward them, I think the most important thing to point out is that, although he pressed forward with the idea of proposing a Thirteenth Amendment, Lincoln continued to leave the question of how it might be ratified in limbo and under a cloud because he insisted that the southern states should be involved in the process of ratification. He continued to talk about bringing those states back into the Union quickly. And I believe that there is good evidence that he did indeed propose to Alexander Stephens at the Hampton Roads Conference that Georgia could ratify the amendment to take effect prospectively, say in five years.</p> 
<p>
A number of good historians have questioned Stephens’ report and have said that we cannot credit it because Alexander Stephens wrote about that conversation in 1870—five years after the fact. But I found an article in the <i>Augusta Chronicle and Sentinel</i>, a Georgia newspaper, written just a few months after the conference, in which the editor reports on a conversation he had with Alexander Stephens immediately after the Hampton Roads Conference. The editor gives an account that is essentially the same as the one Stephens gave in his book in 1870. So I believe that Lincoln was still considering that sort of an idea, and that he did indeed bring this up with Confederates at Hampton Roads.  We also know that when the Confederate commissioners returned to Richmond, they discussed the issue with congressmen. We see from their correspondence that these Confederate congressmen were quite intrigued by the idea that they could reenter the Union and by the vote of ten states block the Thirteenth Amendment.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> Shifting focus to the Confederate policy on slavery and race in the waning days of the war, you discuss the effort to impress slaves into service for the Confederate war effort, a move that seemed to violate the very purpose of Confederate independence. But you argue that the plan’s supporters had ways of maintaining racial subjugation with or without slavery. What did they have in mind?</p>
<p>
<b><i>PDE:</i></b> The Davis administration was explicit about its ideas for the future of southern black people who might have served in the army and gained freedom under the other proposals. What they outlined was that after the war’s end, there could be an intermediate stage of peonage or serfdom before granting full emancipation. And during that time, the Davis administration was proposing that southern states could modify their laws so as to shield the South from some of the criticism that it had received worldwide on slavery. Laws could be passed that would protect the institution of marriage for slaves and give them greater rights to worship and learn to read the Bible.  In this way, things that had been the object of criticism of the South's peculiar institution could be ameliorated.  At the same time the freed slaves would not have equal rights, but would be in a condition of serfdom for some undetermined period. Given that no statement was made about how long that period might be, I think it was open for people to expect that it might be a very long period. But the Davis administration did put that idea forward and those who supported the plan knew this would be part of the future thinking of the Confederate government.</p> 
<p>
Nevertheless, many southerners were simply appalled by the idea of arming and freeing the slaves, and the Congress refused to go along with the idea of considering freedom.  But Jefferson Davis was still interested, as you know. Once Congress finally passed a law to bring some slaves into the army, he issued some executive orders that made clear that only those slaves whose masters would pledge to give them freedom would be accepted into the army. The Davis administration urged some of its allies in state governments to think about providing better legal means for manumission if it came to that and if the war continued and the Confederacy prevailed.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> How did the southern plans to perhaps use armed slaves in exchange for either emancipation or some form of receiving additional rights after the war affect Union strategy? How did Lincoln and his administration view these plans and efforts and proposals from the South?</p> 
<p>
<b><i>PDE:</i></b> I’m not aware of any document in which Lincoln discussed this. I think that northern commentators in general—newspapers and editors—saw it as a sign of desperation or weakness on the part of the South. They felt that it was an indication of how weak the Confederacy's position was and how close to collapse the Confederate war effort was getting. At the time that Lincoln met with the Confederate commissioners, the Confederate Congress had not yet acted. The emancipation proposal had been made, but for a period of about four months, the Confederate Congress dragged its heels and refused to act; it wasn’t until March that they finally took action. And then, only because the legislature of Virginia instructed its senators (who were opposed to the plan) to vote in its favor, was there enough of a majority for it to squeak through in the Confederate Senate by just one vote. But after the fall of Atlanta, I believe that Lincoln, his cabinet, and northerners generally were more optimistic about the ultimate result.  They could see that the war was going well and that the Union was going to win militarily, especially after Sherman had marched to the sea and had arrived in Savannah.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> Going back to the Hampton Roads conference, how earnestly did Lincoln negotiate with the Confederate representatives? Did he honestly seek out some sort of a compromise, peace settlement, or agreement? Or was he merely testing the waters with them to gauge what their situation was as far as continuing to prosecute the war?</p> 
<p>
<b><i>PDE:</i></b> I believe he was absolutely in earnest. He was firm on the question of reunion, but he was much more conciliatory on all other matters, including the ones that we've talked about. And on this crucial issue of offering incentives to the white southerners to come back into the Union and to participate in the process of the reunion even at the expense and interests of black people, I think that his sincerity is clear.  Not only was it consistent with everything he said before, but we know that after the conference was over and Lincoln returned to Washington D.C., he drafted a proposal for a constitutional amendment. This was something he was going to bring before Congress and ask the legislators to consider. The idea was that the federal government would provide a large amount of financial aid to all the slaveholding states, including those that were in the Union, if they would do two things: if they would bring the war to an end and if they would support the Thirteenth Amendment.</p> 
<p>
As he drafted that proposal, Lincoln was offering the South an incentive to adopt the Thirteenth Amendment by the summer of 1865—a shorter period of time than what he had mentioned to Alexander Stephens.  He wasn’t requiring it, but he was trying to lure the southerners into acting in this way. When he shared this idea with his cabinet, they were unanimously opposed. Most of the cabinet and many other northerners by this time felt that this plan was far too lenient, and that Lincoln shouldn’t be thinking in such generous terms. One of his cabinet officials said that he wouldn’t have minded the expense that was involved in providing this aid to the southern states, but there was such a thing as being too generous and going too far.  So Lincoln was not able to carry that proposal forward. But the fact that he drew it up and that he raised this as the next step to take after the conference shows that he was sincere and was dealing forthrightly with these southern commissioners, especially when he encouraged them to come back into the Union and assured them that he would be generous toward them and provide incentives for them to reenter the Union.</p> 
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> In viewing the continuity of racism from the antebellum period through the Civil War and into Reconstruction, you place this book in an interesting historiographical discussion about just how earnest the Republican Party was about endorsing equal rights for African Americans throughout the reconstructed nation. And as you suggest throughout the book, racism prevailed in the North. What role did the persistence of racism in the North play in the persistence of racism in the South—especially because the North was trying to dictate the terms of reconstruction to the South?  And did a majority of Lincoln’s Republican Party ever sincerely endorse equal rights for African Americans during the period of Reconstruction?</p>
<p>
<b><i>PDE:</i></b> That's a very good question and it's probably questionable that they did sincerely endorse equal rights. If you think of the Republican Party overall, it's hard to see that there was a drastic change from the thinking that Republicans had come to just before the war. In his fine book on the ideology of the Republican Party, Eric Foner concludes that Republicans believed that African Americans should have some rights, but the party had not agreed on the meaning of equal rights before the war began—that equal rights meant that African Americans men should be able to vote and that they should have full political rights. It seems clear that during the war, some Republicans did move in a more egalitarian direction and became convinced that African Americans should have political and civil equality under the law. But it’s also clear that there were other Republicans who had not moved that far, not to mention Democrats or others who were less favorable on these issues than the Republicans were.</p> 
<p>
Had it not been for the resistance of southern whites during Reconstruction, it’s doubtful that the Republicans would have agreed in Congress, or prevailed in Congress, on the idea that black men should be given the right to vote. As you know, it was the South's unanimous rejection, except for Tennessee, of the proposed Fourteenth Amendment that compelled Congress to reconsider the means of reconstruction in the South, if it wanted to change anything and to bring about governments that would be different in character from those that Andrew Johnson had created. It was the dynamics of the conflict during Reconstruction that pushed the northern Congress to the point of giving African Americans men the right to vote. Short of that, I doubt there would have been a majority in favor of doing it.</p> 
<p>
Northern racism remained strong and remained a problem. We need to remember, I think, just how pervasive and powerful racism was during period of the Civil War and Reconstruction. It’s part of our nation’s history -- it’s a deep part of our history that we need to remember and recall. I think that the celebratory strain in our popular culture wants to look at the Civil War as a great triumph in so many ways because it makes us feel better about the nation. But I believe that a realistic view of our history does not preclude our feeling good about some of the progress we’ve made. If you recognize the depth and seriousness of racism during the Civil War era, you also could feel that we finally have made a lot of progress since that time. It was a different world then and the pervasiveness of racism and its seriousness in the 19th century was far greater than what we have encountered in our lifetimes.</p>

<h3>Interviewed by Christopher Childers</h3>
<p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR: </i></b> The topic of southern and Confederate nationalism has fascinated historians for much of the past 100 years, if not longer.  What led you to revisit southern nationalism? </p>
<p>
<b><i>Robert E. Bonner (REB): </i></b>  That's a big question. I was always interested in issues of the South's relationship to the rest of the country.  But the work that I was doing in graduate school—thinking about the national crisis and thinking about southern identity and American identity—led me to be skeptical of some of the conventional wisdom of how we frame the question of nationhood and slavery and the American South.  Out of these, I developed some general skepticism towards the leading propositions on the issue.  One interpretation presented southern slaveholders as distrustful of the federal government and distrustful of centralization.  The second interpretation presented them as becoming increasingly alienated from the national project in cultural terms.  My approach came from looking at the evidence and not really finding it matching up all that much to standard interpretations.  By looking at case studies by specialists on the 1850s, one recognizes that the nation really witnessed an escalating series of claims upon the national government rather than individuals exhibiting skepticism of the national government.  At the same time, we see white southerners as being key players in the development of a more robust strain of American nationalism rather than only being about a regional retreat from the federal government. And so in that respect, you have both Unionists and also fireeaters playing a role in national affairs.  For example, what in the world is William Yancey doing being a fundraiser for Mount Vernon?  And what is Robert Barnwell Rhett doing sort of glorifying the Boston Tea Party and trying to reappropriate it for proslavery causes?  So these notions of nationalism in the cultural realm sort of intrigued me.  The challenge of writing the book was trying to put these into conversation—trying to put the idea of nationhood as pertaining to federal power into conversation with a piece of nationhood that had to do with the cultural endeavors of the 1850s, in which white southerners played such a central role.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR: </i></b>  Whereas many, if not most, scholars have focused on either southern nationalism or Confederate nationalism, you take the unique step of investigating nationalism both before and after the creation of the Confederate States of America.  What new insights did you gain from incorporating both in your study? </p>
<p>
<b><i>REB: </i></b>  That certainly was one of the main things I wanted to do.  In fact, early on I wanted to go in past Confederate defeat into the Reconstruction period.  But as is often the case with dissertations, ambitions catch up with research and force the writer to scale back.  But certainly having two-thirds of the book roughly getting up to secession and then using the last one-third to think about Confederate nationhood has paid dividends in terms of the overall project. In the past twenty years, we have gained a richer literature on Confederate nationhood.  And you can ascribe a lot that to Drew Faust’s book, which really shook things up in terms of thinking about different Confederate nationalizing endeavors.  Faust thinks about Confederate nationalization as a process. I tried to follow the Confederate nationalists that she's concerned with and trace them back before the Civil War.  I looked at people who were crucial to forming wartime narratives of what Confederate nationhood was all about, and it seemed like over and over again these were the people who were staunch Unionists who in the 1850s were involved in all sorts of endeavors that transcended the slave South.  The clergy were certainly important in Faust’s perspective and they had really interesting things to say about American nationhood in the 1850s.  Tracing and going over the divide between the antebellum period and into the Confederate period, seemed to make a lot of sense because this is a book that focuses on nationalists rather than on the larger collective identity problems in traditional studies of nationalism.  By focusing on nationalists and on individualists, the sharp departure that Lincoln’s election and secession represented comes into clear perspective. And so the people who were trying to shape American nationhood up to Lincoln’s election seemed to have played a disproportionate role in trying to articulate notions of Confederate purpose and policy in the aftermath. </p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR: </i></b>  Your study focuses chiefly on the development of “master class nationalism,” as you call it, both within the federal Union and then in the Confederacy.  But what difficulty did the master class face in convincing southerners with little to no stake in the institution of slavery that slaveholder interests matched the concerns of common folk?  Or did the overwhelming majority of southerners identify with slavery regardless of their slave holdings? </p>
<p>
<b><i>REB: </i></b>   That's a great question. And to the extent that my story is about proslavery nationalists and trying to represent their interests on the national and world stage, I also acknowledge but do not explore this to the extent that I could and that others have. They also have a challenge in presenting their vision of the country, the region, and the main developments in their way of life to the population to those outside the master class.  They can’t take that for granted that they're going to get a solid support even within their own regions.  One of the reasons I didn’t develop that as much as I could have is because other scholars have developed that theme with such effect in other works.  The works of Bill Freehling, Eugene Genovese, and others have explored the master class's relationship to other white southerners. And so that wasn’t my topic. I had some ideas of following them and their work, and I would certainly footnoted them in terms of thinking about these ideas.  Certainly race, the political system, and evangelical religion, among other factors had something to do with it. These are all ingredients that led me into thinking about how other people have shaped that key problem. In the last chapter, I explore the key challenges of Confederate nationhood and the sort of rumbling class conflict that the war brings.   At that point the crisis of Confederate nationhood can be defined as a crisis that follows master-class nationalism—that has to depend a lot more on the master class and in the end doesn’t measure up. </p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR: </i></b> <i>Mastering America</i> focuses not only on the idea of nationalism itself, but the individuals who created and advanced the nationalist idea.  But in truth, can we speak of a unitary idea of nationalism? To what extent did individual southern nationalists differ in their writings and in their agenda not only for American nationalism but of course after 1861 for what became Confederate nationalism? </p>

<b><i>REB: </i></b>  That’s another great question that's at the heart of how I approached the multiplicity of different notions of what nationhood as a concept is really all about and the variance even within the master class.  The variety is I think the key. And so the chapters, the way I laid them out, really try to explore both the main categories of thinking about nationhood and even within those categories the differences of opinion. So you have lots of different perspectives. There’s a great array of approaches and again much of this book is an accumulation of research by other historians.  In that respect, I’m really fond of Michael O’Brien in terms of thinking about all the different riches and complexity and lack of uniformity that southern writers in particular have in approaching almost every problem.  So you have this array of different ways of thinking about the world and conjectures of different modes of social organization, political organization, and economic organization. As I organized the book into chapters, I did do it thematically and so I have chapters that in terms of those who predominately think, write, and act in behalf of the nation as a constitutional unit or as a body of individuals that are subscribing to republican ideas or evangelical ideas or efforts to create a notion of nationhood around shared historical memories. And so I do think that again it is maybe the heart of what I’m up to try to sort of break this down and to think about the variety. </p>
<p>
When we get to the Confederacy, I’ve got a chapter called ""Reckoning with Confederate Purpose,"" and there I schematize most explicitly these three main strands of thinking about Confederate purpose that perhaps do not have much to do with one another.  So there's three ways of thinking the Confederacy as a new endeavor and what it meant. Is it a replay of American Revolution?  Is it an opportunity to reject the American Revolution and develop new modes of thinking about authority?  Or is it an opportunity to perfect certain notions of paternalism?  Part of the objective is to lay out the breadth and the rigidness of thinking about nationhood. When we think about nationalism, we tend often times to pair it with notions of identity. And so thinking about southern nationhood is thinking about becoming more southern, or thinking about our American nation as becoming more American, or thinking about Confederate nationhood becoming more Confederate. And that's certainly something that in the 19th century, people were talking about; but they were talking about a lot of other different things in terms of what nationhood represented as well. And so I’m trying to recapture the 19th century understanding of nationhood in all its complexity.  Part of the reason it’s such an appealing concept in the 19th century is because building a nation or engaging in a national project meant so many different things to different people. </p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR: </i></b>  The most ardent proslavery spokesmen have gained the lion’s share of attention from scholars of the Civil War.  Yet you argue that, in many ways, the conservative Unionists of the South held the key to southern nationalism and southern politics.  How did they influence the course that the South took both within the Union and without the Union? </p>
<p>
<b><i>REB: </i></b>   They were able to be influential in part because they were just more of them.  We do get that notion, especially once you get outside of South Carolina, that prior to Lincoln’s election there was a small concentrated secessionist movement. And even after Lincoln’s election, I suppose, conservative Unionists, who you could define as people who have a vision of cutting a better deal within the Union, had so many different maneuvers.  Even those people who go to Montgomery to write a Confederate constitution are sort of holding this up as a means to get the rest of the states back into the Union—maybe without New England!   So they're influential because the southern populace, I think, does share a certain American feeling that bigger is better—that always wanting to bring in more territory is better than less territory.  And if they could do that on their own terms, if they could gain greater protections for slavery, especially with slavery expansion, then there's not much to argue why that wouldn’t be a good idea. For the secessionists, it’s better to have a smaller, more compact, and more overtly proslavery Deep South alliance independent of the rest of the states.  I think the conservative Unionists are winning the argument because they are getting a lot more throughout the 1850s; they're getting Kansas-Nebraska, Dred Scott, the administration of James Buchanan—the government sort of at their beck-and-call. So the fireeaters have a hard argument to make until you have the Republican Party take power, and suddenly their argument makes sense. </p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR: </i></b>  Don Fehrenbacher, who in his book on the Dred Scott case, which you just mentioned, noted that in antebellum political history so many political issues became constitutional issues, issues over interpreting the founding charter. And you seem to suggest that in some ways the development of southern nationalism represents the search for a southern version of constitutional theory, one that's built on inherited political forms but that secures important inherited rights, to use some of your words. To what extent did southern nationalists use the U.S. Constitution for their aims and what ultimately did they reject from the founding document? </p>
<p>
<b><i>REB: </i></b>  I did incorporate a lot of things about the Constitution into the book, especially in thinking about constitutionalism.  Let me maybe try to generalize the source of ideas I have about proslavery constitutionalism as I have articulated.  The constitutionalism that we generally think about regarding slavery is something along the lines of the fact that slaveholders showed up in Philadelphia in 1787, and by threats of various sorts, gained a lot of what they wanted written into the Constitution—the fugitive slave clause, the perpetuation of the slave trade, or the three-fifths representation of slaves. So proslavery efforts in Philadelphia gained a disproportionate role to slavery in politics.  One of the things that I’m trying to do is to maybe agree with that, but to think about constitutionalism as an ongoing process that involves continually trying to up the ante and trying to make an increasingly proslavery interpretation of the Constitution the predominant one as handed down by the Supreme Court and other governing institutions. I follow that process and try to think about how, beginning with the paring of states’ rights and proslavery arguments in the 1820s and then moving forward to how that plays itself out in the 1850s.  </p>
<p>
There hasn’t really been much written about sectional rights as a mode of constitutional argumentation. And so a long time ago, Arthur Bestor, in a couple of classic articles wrote about states’ rights as a doctrine of positive power. His work formed a lot of my thinking of how states’ rights can be not just about blocking but compelling the federal government into action in certain ways. And so from that original insight, I’m sort of spinning this out and saying that actually the language of the people in the 1850s is not so much states’ rights, but southern rights. This notion of southern rights is never something that is brought before the Supreme Court, but it does become part of a constitutional logic and a popular constitutionalism that incorporates the story of what happened in Philadelphia, not just separate states forming a union, but actually two well defined regions coming together and making a truce or a treaty between two regions. And this is something that filters into popular consciousness and forms a sort of political dialogue in the late 1850s that I found really interesting.  A lot of things going on in constitutional history now attend to popular constitutionalism. So I’m sort of picking up there.  You have a body of law school professor types who are thinking about how popular constitutional dialogue shapes politics as much as it shapes court cases, and that's certainly true of the 19th century.  So thinking about southern rights falls into this pattern.  But that’s something you'd never take before a court because of the court ruling could not understand that because there is nothing essentially fabricated on a thin textual basis, but it makes a compelling story to sort of show in a sense that slaveholders have rights because there was an original agreement between a South and a North, and that the North is sort of failing to live up to their agreement by, for instance, returning fugitive slaves to a South and that they're breaking this bargain. </p>
<p>
Therefore to withdraw from the Union is legitimate because the original treaty has already sort of been broken. It's striking how much you hear of the refusal to return slaves during the secession crisis, as the predominant explanations for why secession is legitimate. It’s maybe even more important than the fact that Union is a compact of states, that every state has the sovereign power to withdraw and that's certainly an important argument that’s being made in 1860-1861. It’s not just about the power, but why it has come time to withdraw. Again and again, it’s the North that has failed to live up to its constitutional obligations; therefore the South and the defenders of southern rights have a duty to withdraw if this isn’t going to get any better, which it doesn’t look like it is. So that's sort of a loose answer to thinking about constitutionalism. One of the things that also struck me is the dialogue about constitutionalism during the Confederacy.  A lot of nationalists began to think about constitutionalism as something that can really be set aside and so increasing the power of the Confederate government, increasing the power of executive within the Confederate government, not having a Supreme Court that would put the brakes on the enhancement of Confederate power all seem to me to be worth writing about.  This is something that people who have written about the Confederacy have pointed out before, but in light of earlier constitutional issues, they're right about the bottom line is that constitutionalism is about southern rights. </p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR: </i></b>  That's a fascinating insight because when you then discuss the idea of southern rights over states’ rights, and you cross that bridge of 1861 into the years of the Confederacy, does that then suggest that perhaps a number of people within the Confederacy itself might have been more amenable to a stronger Confederate government—a strong national government that nevertheless protected their rights? And this of course is not withstanding the states’ rights policies of men like say Joseph Brown in Georgia who's probably the most famous case of obstructionism in the Confederacy. </p>
<p>
<b><i>REB: </i></b>  You can’t, and I don’t, minimize the importance of states’ rights, in certain constituencies both during the 1850s and in fact during the Confederacy. I suppose that beginning with Calhoun, there are ways that people perceive that sort of strict states’ rights approach might not accomplish all that slaveholders needed.  I suppose more than anything else, the southern rights position is a more advanced argument, even if it’s not as prevalent.  But it’s also a very instrumental argument.  In saying that there are southern rights that you are basically saying that there are ways that the South can call upon the federal government to protect slaveholders rights.  During the Confederacy there are some noises about the fact that slaveholders need explicit protection against the government.  There are some interesting movements to introduce legislation at the state level to say the state government can never abridge slaveholders’ rights, nor can the Confederate government abridge slaveholders’ rights.  And so there’s a fear that a government, the new Confederate government, will disregard the sanctity of the institution of slavery in the same way the federal government disregarded the sanctity of the institution of slavery. To the extent that there’s a big debate at the end of the war about whether or not pair a program of slave enlistment with a program of general slave, that skepticism is well placed because the Confederate government at the end of the Davis administration is arguing for the preeminence of the sanctity of government over the sanctity of slavery. They're no longer talking in terms of southern rights; a lot of individuals at that point more going back to the states rights, especially the loud voices against slave enlistment about the program of emancipation and enlistment coming out of the South Carolina.  </p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR: </i></b>  Though southerners developed their own theories on constitutional law, they still maintained an attachment to the American past and the Revolutionary heritage.  Indeed, you note that southern masters sought to rescue the Revolutionary experiment from the “apostate Yankee Republicans” and to “redeem the tomb of Washington from the dominion of that fanatical rule”—to quote Charles Colcock Jones, Jr.  Did attachment to the American Revolutionary heritage help or hinder the development of Confederate nationalism? </p>
<p>
<b><i>REB: </i></b>   This portrays the sliver of the project, where I draw on the insights of David Potter on the conflicting loyalties of region and nation and interest in the 1850s. Potter includes some off-handed remarks about the Mount Vernon movement, the American Revolution, and the fiercely proprietary claims that southerners are making on the revolutionary heritage. And so Potter's work was really influential especially in framing the project to begin with. Thinking about the revolutionary heritage makes a lot of sense.  As you get into the Confederate period, it becomes even more so I suppose and that may be a little bit more well known in terms of other historians have written.  Faust and Anne Rubin, among others, have really thought about how Confederates answered these questions and made it a benefit to have an American revolutionary past at their disposal by popularizing the notion that this is the Second American Revolution, a moment of great historical importance that future generations will remember and identify with in the same way that this generation identified with the revolutionary period creating a whole cast of heroes and heroic episodes and so on and so forth.  That hot house environment of war does escalate and intensify the connections, but certainly in thinking about the identification of antebellum Americans with the revolutionary past. </p>

<h3>Interviewed by Nathan Buman</h3>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR: </i></b> My first question, what led you to venture away from your three-volume study of the American frontier in <i>Gunfighter Nation, The Fatal Environment, and Regeneration Through Violence</i> to examine the Battle of the Crater during the American Civil War? </p>
<p>
<b><i>RS: </i></b> Well I’ve always been interested in the civil war, in fact my interest in American history in general really dates from two things: western movies when I was growing up and visits to civil war battlefields and for various reasons having to do with the way my education went that my career developed I  wasn’t professionally licensed to write about the Civil War coming out of graduate school but I was so interested in it that it was always in the back of my mind as something I wanted to do.  It’s really to me the water shed of American history.  It’s the place where the United States turned into the unified nation-state that we’ve got the industrialized nation state and it’s also the moment when our perennial conflict between racialism and belief in equality comes to a head and the issue really takes a modern form.  </p>
<p> 
<b><i>CWBR: </i></b> What if any are some of the similar themes that you can trace across your frontier analysis and your look at the crater?  It seems to me that you have in part shown a similar trend toward imagery through conflict to detail very differing frontiers. </p>
<p>
<b><i>RS: </i></b> Yeah, I see that I focused on the way in which, let’s change this.  The key to the stuff I've done on the frontier is the idea that we've as a culture we've always seen violence as an essential means for producing the nation that we became and in the frontier what makes the United States ""American"" is the conflict with the Native Americans so there is always a racial dimension in there from the start and that combination of racism and violence has a different form but a parallel form in the Civil War where both sides are grappling with the question of: what is the relation between white and black?  Is it potentially a relationship of equality; that is are blacks Americans as well as whites? or is the United States a white man’s republic and that issue, which in a sense begins on the Indian frontier, comes home in the Civil War and it comes home with tremendous violence.  It’s my contention that the South secedes, primarily, to preserve white supremacy; slavery as an institution yes but as an institutional means for the preservation of white supremacy and the North doesn't get it in those terms.  The North thinks that slavery and white supremacy are two different issues and one of the things that happens is as the North confronts the end of slavery and particularly as the soldiers on the battle line confront the question: shall I fight for the end of slavery, what succeeds slavery what comes after is the question of black equality.  And northern whites as well as southern whites are violently freaked out by that notion and the thing about the Battle of the Crater is: it ends with a massacre of black troops, not only by Confederates who are storming the position the blacks are occupying, but white troops on the northern side turn against the blacks and kill them as well.  </p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR: </i></b> So it’s almost like the Battle of the Crater and the American Civil War are sort of a frontier in itself towards that unified nation-state. </p>
<p>
<b><i>RS: </i></b> Yeah it’s a frontier in a sort of symbolic sense, the frontier between, or the borderlands, between two different Americas.  In one of which white supremacy is assumed and slavery exists and the other slavery is removed and now you have to ask yourself: are you still in favor of white supremacy? </p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR: </i></b> Well much of your narrative focuses on the experiences of the United States Colored Troops as you say, and their enlistment in the war following emancipation in the proclamation. Do you think the enrollment of black soldiers altered the course of the war politically and/or ideologically and how so? </p>
<p>
<b><i>RS: </i></b> I think it altered it in both ways. First of all, just in terms of numbers: I think the statistics show there were something like the North had a little bit over 2 million men under arms during the Civil War.  By the end of the war nearly 200,000 troops, almost 10% were African American.  That’s very significant and is actually even more significant since their presence is weighted into the last two years of the war and although they don’t take a leading role in most major battles the Crater is an exception in that way.  Their role is absolutely essential; there is a whole corps of black troops in the army of the Potomac by the end of the war so just militarily their entirely significant.  Politically and socially, war is about politics as well as about tactics and the fact that black troops could come marching through slave territory in the South had a tremendous impact on the stability of the slave-based economy even before northern success guaranteed the end of slavery.  And the political issue in the North, by the 1864 election.  In the 1864 election, the Democrats contest Lincoln’s administration with essentially a campaign for white supremacy, arguing that to preserve white supremacy you have got to throw the Republicans out.  When Lincoln is endorsed by popular vote the possibility of something like a movement in the direction of racial equality gets a certain kind of credibility so the role politically, socially, and tactically is highly significant. </p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR: </i></b> Well what did the blacks’ fighting experience itself accomplish for African Americans that simple freedom through emancipation could not? </p>
<p>
<b><i>RS: </i></b>  Well you have to remember that the right to serve in the militia or in the army is a fundamental civil right, the famous Second Amendment has not only to do with fire arms, ""the right to bear arms,"" explicitly deals with the right serve in the national defense and until 1863 blacks were barred from militia service in all the northern states including Massachusetts.  And admission to that civil right has a tremendous symbolic and cultural impact.  Remember also that this is a country in which only men can vote and which the concept of manhood is almost indistinguishable from the concept of political equality or political rights.  So if you admit blacks to the civil right of service as men bearing arms the cultural impact is immense.  Even those blacks who never see combat have their sense of self and their sense of their possibilities of self turned around by military service.  I think studies have shown that blacks who served in the military tended to do better in Reconstruction than those who didn’t, in part because they learned a certain skill as soldiers as well but the psychological impact I think is immense.  </p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR: </i></b> Well on page 328 you state that the mine explosions seem to be ""an extraordinary escalation in the murderous cruelty and destructive power of the federal war effort"" and Charles Royster has discussed the destructive nature of the war that made the conflict increasingly exhaustive for soldiers and civilians alike.  How did the Battle of the Crater change warfare and the psyche or the psychological aspects of both armies? </p>
<p>
<b><i>RS: </i></b> Well I think you have to put it on, again, a kind of continuum of developments.  The technology of violence gets upped by the Civil War and that’s what the crater explosion is part of.  The Confederate army invented the use of land mines during the Civil War.  A Confederate officer did that. That too was regarded by generals on both sides as un-chivalrous as an illegitimate means of making war, almost as bad as the use of poison gas.  In fact, the use of poison gas was actually proposed by several officers on both sides during the course of the Civil War.  Technology made it impossible but there it is.  Once you go to war the use of violence and violent means to win the war becomes primary over time but part of it takes again this technological form.  The other side of it, the part that Royster talks about, is the willingness to inflict pain and social destruction in order to obtain victory and that’s, I think, the bigger side of it technology is one thing but the will to kill the will to destroy is upped intensively the longer that a war goes on particularly where the issues are so fundamental as they are in the civil war.  </p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR: </i></b> Well why do you feel that the slaughter occurred to the degree that it did in the crater specifically the inter-racial violence.  Is it confederates who are blaming black soldiers for the waning fortunes of the Confederacy or were they afraid that the social hierarchy based on white supremacy was crumbling or was it simpler than that? </p>
<p>
<b><i>RS: </i></b> Well I think that both of those things are true.  That is, they do feel that the presence of blacks is really a major contribution to the overthrow of the Confederacy.  Remember, not only because of the numbers that they are now facing but the fact that the presence of black troops carries with it the implied threat of a slave uprising behind the lines and the intense racial hatred is also a part of it.  But one of the most critical things which I point to in the book is the role of Confederate officials in establishing a framework of law and policy which encouraged racial murders.  The Confederacy had officially taken the position that blacks captured in arms would not be taken prisoner and that the white officers leading these troops should be treated under Confederate state law as persons inciting a slave insurrection which made them liable for the death penalty.  Now fear of Federal retaliation led the Confederacy to back off from officially enforcing the policy but as I quote in the book the Confederate Secretary of War said, yeah we can't do this publicly, but let's do it secretly.  Let the killing be done red-handed on the field of battle rather than taking these guys prisoners and then executing them.  So what you get then is a kind of uneven enforcement in which local officers and private soldiers even granted permission by their government to do these killings they either do the killings or they refuse to do the killings.  So what I think is true here is that the Confederate government sets a frame in which racial murders are approved and soldiers in the heat of battle act in that framework and they regard their actions therefore as not only justified by their emotions but also justified by the policy of their government.  In that way I parallel it with atrocities like the My Lai massacre in Vietnam.  Some of it is on the troops in the field but there's also this framework of policy which makes murder and indiscriminant killing either inevitable or something that's approved. </p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR: </i></b> well you suggest that the result of the battle of the crater may have lead to Lincoln’s failure in the November 1864 election that it could have been possible for him to…</p>
<p>
<b><i>RS: </i></b> Yeah he succeeds, but what it produces is a really bad moment for his political campaign and the battle occurs at the end of July.  In August he writes that famous memorandum which he requires his cabinet officers to sign without reading which commits them to win the war before the new president takes office on the grounds that the guy who beats Lincoln will have won on a peace platform that will end the war without victory.  So Lincoln is pretty discouraged at that point and justifiably so by the failure of this big battle; other things as well but this was the big fight that had occurred right before that. </p>
<p>  
<b><i>CWBR: </i></b> Do you think that Lincoln’s discouragement and concern over the election results, was that more due to the mounting casualties of Grant's Virginia campaign or is that as a result of the increasing concerns over the enlistment and the use of black soldiers throughout the north in the civilian population? </p>
<p>
<b><i>RS: </i></b> in Lincoln’s case I think it's more the casualties.  He had already taken into account the backlash against his recruitment of black troops and one of the things that I think is remarkable about this period is the uncompromising forthright way in which Lincoln defends the blacks and the use of black troops and even uses the fighting of black troops as an argument for ultimately granting them civil equality.  There's a great speech which I quote in the book in which he contrasts the loyalty and service of black soldiers with the disloyalty and foot-dragging of white Democrats. </p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR: </i></b> David Blight has suggested that northern and southern whites erased African Americans from commemoration after the civil war leading into the 20th century, focusing instead on the collaborative white memory of the conflict.  Why do you think the efforts to the United States Colored Troops at the Battle of the Crater have been ignored and why do they posses as you say ""no monument to the memory of the African American troops who fought and died in the crater""? </p>
<p>
<b><i>RS: </i></b> Well Blight's book on that subject is absolutely correct.  In the case of the crater battle we can actually see that in the speeches that were made during the reenactments that were developed in order to create a battlefield park, that blacks are deliberately excluded from that.  And part of the reason is that at the time that these commemorative movements are really gaining strength and influence this is the Jim Crow era in southern politics, when blacks who had gained civil rights in the post war period have those civil rights taken away by state action and this is when the regime of segregation and the elimination of blacks from the voting roles is taking place in the South and also the great waves of lynching in the South.  So it’s that sort of groundswell shift in southern politics that I think is part of that denial of a black role in the Battle of the Crater.  In a way though from the northern side it's consistent with what happened during the battle, that is to say the northerners in the battle identified more with their fellow whites than with their black comrades in arms and that tendency is carried through in the postwar period  as well. </p>

<h3>Interviewed by Nathan Buman</h3>
<p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR :</i></b> I’m here today with Lacy K. Ford, author of <i>Deliver Us from Evil: The Question of Slavery in the Old South</i>.  Professor Ford, thank you for joining me.</p>
<p>
<b><i>Lacy K. Ford (LKF):</i></b> I’m happy to be here.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b>    In <i>Deliver Us from Evil</i> you deemphasize the idea of a monolithic South, instead focusing on the upper South and lower South between 1787 and 1840 and the ideological shift over that time in the way southerners thought about the institution of slavery.  How did you decide to approach this difficult task and what made you want to explore the differences among southerners within the south?</p>
<p>
<b><i>LFK:</i></b>   You know I don’t know that I started out the project knowing that it was going to take that direction but I think that as I began to gather and sort through the evidence, it seemed like that there were different patterns of response and behavior.  Looking at it more closely, I could see that the sort of predominant division in that behavior was between upper South and lower South.  Now there were certainly some internal disagreement in the upper South and some internal disagreement in the lower South but there seemed to be a fundamentally different approach to things in upper and lower South and I decided therefore to tell the story moving from one sub region to another.  This is, of course, suggested in Professor William Freehling’s work: the first volume of <i>the Road to Disunion</i> more than a decade earlier.  I had read that and so I knew that there were important upper and lower South divisions that were going to have to be reckoned with but it was a matter of kind of going through the empirical data and just deciding this was the analysis that made the most sense.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b>   Sure, just let the evidence lead you.</p>
<p> 
<b><i>LKF:</i></b>   Yes. </p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b>    The concept of paternalism plays a large part throughout your study and has challenged historians for many years.  How would you define paternalism and what role do you believe it played for white and black southerners living in a biracial society?</p>
<p>
<b><i>LKF:</i></b>   Well before answering that question I’ll give you a little background.  I think the treatment that I ended up giving paternalism in the book was far different from what I had initially anticipated.  But I think that I came to understand through my research that paternalism or at least the central thrust of it (there was always some sort of noise around the edges) began as an insurgent ideology that came directly out of the church.  The Christian church and the evangelical denominations played a large role beginning in the Second Great Awakening or at least receiving its most coherent and consistent and determined expression beginning in the Second Great Awakening and that initially it was very much a sort of minority insurgence, in some ways even prophetic voice in the South with its message about slavery and it had a lot of skeptics, a lot of outright opponents, a lot of people who paid no attention at all.  But over time, in the way that insurgent movements do, it began to win more and more followers probably as the church began to have more and more influence and although it endured a great number of challenges, I think by the late 1830s it had become the sort of dominant ideology of slaveholding in the South certainly in the lower South.  Now, to some extent, it was a convenient explanation for slavery in the face of outside criticism and I think that convenience was an important part of its journey from sort of insurgency to a hegemony.  But I do think that the insurgency was based on a small determined but growing band of people who saw paternalism as the best way of understanding slavery.  So I think in some ways paternalism was a moderating influence among slaveholders in the South and that moderation helped actually helped slaves, not in the ways that the paternalists explained, but it helped slaves in their resistance in their ongoing efforts to carve out maneuvering room for themselves, to form and to have space, to develop their own culture, and their own sort of pre-political identity.  That, of course, was not paternalism’s goal at all.  It was kind of arguing that it was an ideology which would ultimately end in slaves kind of buying into the system and of course it did not achieve that but it was something that the slaves can use effectively to their own advantage even though if it had worked the way slaveholders wanted it to work that wouldn’t have been true at all.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b>    You mentioned evangelical Christianity and you certainly emphasized its role in South Carolina and the part that it played in the slaveholding ideology for both white and black.  What role, if any, did this evangelical Christianity play in the upper South or other parts of the lower South like Louisiana where Catholicism dominated early on?</p>
<p>
<b><i>LKF:</i></b>    I think it played a very similar role, perhaps in slightly different time frames, across the lower South and in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and much of Louisiana outside of the New Orleans area.  I think Protestant Christianity had a similar influence and, while my discussion tended to be South Carolina-centered on that, I think I do treat Alabama and Mississippi, Georgia to some extent in saying that I think similar developments were going on there and charting them.  Now, because they were settled later and didn’t have urban centers like Charleston, I think it took hold to some extent a little bit later.  I mean in some places I think that there was not as intense of an opposition to paternalism, say in Mississippi, as there was in South Carolina but I do think across the lower South it was similar.  I think the story of the upper South is a little bit more complicated and in the end I decided not to try to tease it all out in an already long book but I think in the portions of the upper South which remained pretty deeply committed to slavery, the more heavily black regions of the upper South like the south side of Virginia, reached essentially similar conclusions as the lower South and Protestant Christianity played a fairly large role in the development of the paternalist ideology.  I do think in those portions of the upper South like western Virginia, where there remained a good bit of desire to minimize slavery’s role, people saw paternalism maybe as a very short-term alternative but not as good of an idea as selling off slaves to the lower South, perhaps colonizing slaves, perhaps looking toward gradual emancipation.  Therefore, because slavery didn’t seem to have (they didn’t want it to have) as much permanence, paternalism wasn’t embraced as anything other than a kind of short-term practical way of managing affairs.</p>
<p> 
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b>    You spoke of the resistance against paternalism.  You certainly challenge the idea of complacency among slaves but how prevalent were, not just revolts or scares, but daily resistance and individual violence and how did these instances shape white southern ideology?</p>
<p>
<b><i>LKF:</i></b>    I think slave resistance was always at work in shaping the way white southerners perceived slavery.  I do think there is a way in which (I don’t dwell on this as much perhaps in the book as I perhaps could have) white southerners thought they could manage the institution but I think they really thought they could handle and manage the day-to-day resistance that they encountered.  They thought that was kind of what it meant to be a slaveholder was to deal with that.  I think they remained more concerned about dealing with larger and more concerted action and particularly if they thought that action would occur with any great frequency and that the outside world might not support all of their efforts to put it down.  So I do think that, not merely the more common day-to-day resistance, but the threat of larger resistance played a role in their response.  But, I think at the same time, they tended to think they could manage all of these things.  What they debated greatly was: what was the best way to do it.  Some people had the idea that paternalism was virtually useless in that regard and others argued that this was actually the way to avoid the scares and these crises.</p>
<p> 
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b>   These scare and these crises, the actual open rebellions that you discuss in <i>Deliver Us from Evil</i>, mostly took place in Virginia, South Carolina and Louisiana.  How would you explain why you see little evidence of larger insurrection plots and scares in the interior states like Tennessee Alabama, or Mississippi?</p>
<p>
<b><i>LKF:</i></b>    That’s probably not a question I can answer on the basis of my research.  I think that there were certainly some scares in Mississippi from time to time.  How large and how much attention are given to these things somehow tended to depend a lot on how the whites felt it necessary to respond to it.  I think the alleged Denmark Vesey conspiracy could have almost been a footnote in history.  However serious you believe the conspiracy might or might not have been, it could have been handled with a lot less fan fair if the whites had chosen to do so and they chose not to do so.  And now Nat Turner, of course, is another story but in many ways the white leadership, in dealing with Nat Turner, sort of tried to minimize the significance of it in the aftermath.  Once the rebellion was put down their official word was: well it wasn’t that elaborate of a plot and so on and so forth.  And so that’s interesting to me and I think that more work could be done (I think I’ve made some suggestions about what I think or how I think white responses were shaped) probably more work could be done.  There may be a way in which,  I think more work could be done in trying to examine rumors and allegations in other portions of the South that haven’t gotten as much attention.  My guess is that similar kinds of things may have been happening all along and lower on the Richter scale of resistance that led to similar thoughts.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b>    During your discussion of David Walker’s <i>Appeal</i> in 1829 you suggested that “the South as a whole had never reacted with any uniformity across state or sub regional boundaries to previous scares and insurrections.”  How was David Walker’s <i>Appeal</i> different and what role did it play in the potential unification of the South that you eluded to as it proceeded into the 1830s?</p>
<p>
<b><i>LKF:</i></b>    That was an interesting finding to me.  I had not anticipated that and I guess that maybe I anticipated that there would have been some unanimity earlier but even Denmark Vesey didn’t ripple across the lower South in the way that David Walker’s <i>Appeal</i> did.  I guess the reason is that it happened in a large number of places at approximately the same time and I think therefore showed the danger of a written document that could be seen as instigating insurrection was enormously threatening in a way that even a serious insurrection plot like Gabriel’s plot in 1800 really wasn’t.  I think that the abolitionist were quick to learn from that.  That’s why they came up with their flooding the mails campaign in the mid 1830s because they realized how powerful they could be.  So I think my best hypothesis about why that was such a sweeping scare was that those pamphlets arrived, not everywhere, but in many parts of the South within a fairly narrow time frame of a couple of years and therefore created a kind of simultaneous reaction which was something.  They were kind of in quasi-equal intensity everywhere.  I mean an insurrection scare is always going to have more impact in the area where it occurs and kind of dissipate, the ripple effects dissipate as they get further from the center.  But a printed appeal is a different thing and really that’s what happens with the 1830s.  It’s words on a page that I think drives the slaveholders into a frenzy more than anything else.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b>    In response to a lot of these rebellions or scares starting in 1800, or even before, whites struggled to decide how best to deal with the black population so what I wonder is how hard was it for white southerners to reconcile their desires to whiten their locality to protect their safety with their continued desire to grow labor-intensive cash crops?  How did those who sought the diffusion of African Americans or colonization plan to continue cash crop production?  Where would the labor come from?</p>
<p>
<b><i>LKF:</i></b>    I think that was their fundamental tension.  I think that, particularly in the upper South where slave labor-generated cash crops perhaps either stagnant or declining, there was a real tension about that particular question.  The general answer to it in the upper South was we are probably not going to be without slaves anytime soon but we certainly would like wean ourselves away from as much dependence on slave labor and become a whiter region than we are now.  And I think, while that varied from county to county, there was a strong sense there but it was a big part of the debate.  In the lower South I think it was a tension that just almost couldn’t be resolved.  I think people could see that their staple crop prosperity depended on slave labor and the way to get more of it for yourself was to own slaves.  At the same time they could never quite get over this anxiety of the particular area where you live becoming too black and that was really, in some ways, the travail of slavery.  It seems to me, in the lower South was that tension between prosperity and safety really and it’s a delicate balancing act.  I think there was this kind of notion which involves a little bit of using suggestive rather than definitive evidence on my part because a lot of whites thought there was a kind of golden mean, that as long as the slave population didn’t exceed about 40 percent of a given area, things would be okay.  So when you are beneath that threshold acquisition of more slaves was a good thing and after that it was kind of something to worry about.  But the problem is there’s no way to implement that as a policy.  That’s kind of the notion and the microeconomic realities were once the people or many of them were going to acquire slaves if they could and you have portions of the lower South which are much, much blacker than 40 percent.  That created some, particularly in areas where some went through the transition later, a good bit of tension, I think.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b>    Well you mentioned William Freehling’s volume one of <i>Road to Disunion</i>.  What do you think (in light of that and some of his other work) what do you feel that your analysis might tell us about why secession happened the way it did as the lower South seceded before Sumter, followed by the upper South afterward and the border states: Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland, and Delaware remaining within the union?</p>
<p>
<b><i>LKF:</i></b>    Well I guess I do think in many ways that what I’ve essentially done is (Freehling provided in his first volume a sort of, while it has a sort of social, cultural, and economic history dimension, it is essentially a political narrative) and I think that he laid out very nicely this kind of dialectic between the upper and lower South.  In politics in which the lower South extremism kind of nurtured moderation in the upper South which then drove the lower South to greater extremism and there was this sort of dialectic there.  I think that what I’ve done is go back and look at attitudes toward slavery that sort of underlay some of this political dichotomy and explain that in looking at attitudes toward slavery.  And then I think that that helps to understand some things that Freehling covers in volume two where the lower South is certainly more committed, more quickly to leaving the union, the upper South is more divided, some of it’s not ever going to leave the union, and some of it’s going to leave the union reluctantly, and pockets of it aren’t going to be happy that you’ve left, and so on and so forth.  I think that really shouldn’t be (once you’ve read my book) that shouldn’t be particularly surprising.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b>    Well you state, and I quote: “by the late 1830s the upper and lower South had each decided that their respective answers to the slavery question lay in different ways of reconfiguring the institution,” and then the last sentence of your book states that your effort to “answer the slavery question explains nothing less than how and why whites in the old South created the self-images they fought to preserve in the American Civil War.”  Would you suggest that southerners fought for differing self-images of how best to practice and manage the institution of slavery?</p>
<p>
<b><i>LKF:</i></b>    Yeah I think so.  I think that, by 1840 and certainly by the time of secession, the slave holders in the lower South and common whites who agreed with slaveholders tended to envision themselves as defending this kind of paternalist notion of slavery which supported white democracy and protected the independence of the ordinary southerner.  I think in the upper South the slaveholders and whites that agreed with them saw themselves as people who understood the problem was related to slavery did not slight the moral implications that it might have held and were trained to work out, as best they could, a way of gradually diminishing slavery.  And as such were heirs of Thomas Jefferson and the founders as they understood them and were leaving the union only because they were forced to in a certain way.  I think those were differing conceptions of what everything was about and I think I would have been surprised if it were different.  There is some interesting work to be done and some has been done, but more could be done, to look at how notions of the Confederacy and the Lost Cause and what slavery had meant from a postbellum post-emancipation perspective but could still be done because as we all know Virginia emerges as a big Lost Cause state despite a very ambivalent attitude in going into the war.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b>    Well Professor for Thank you so much for joining me in discussing your most recent book <i>Deliver Us from Evil: The Question of Slavery in the Old South.</i></p>

<b>CWBR:</b>  I’m here today with Professor Christian G. Samito, author of <i>Becoming American Under Fire: Irish Americans, African Americans, and the Politics of Citizenship during the Civil War Era</i>.  Professor Samito, thank you for joining me.</p>
<p> 
<b>Christian G. Samito (CS):</b> My pleasure.</p>
<p>
<b>CWBR:</b> How did you decide to focus this study on African Americans and Irish Americans?</p>
<p>
<b>CS:</b>  Well I think that they are two interesting groups because in the 1850s they really are at the heart of the debate regarding national citizenship and who are the American people.  African Americans are excluded completely from national citizenship by the Dred Scott decision.  And with Irish Americans, Irish immigrants are able to naturalize but there's some real question as to what that means in the law because national citizenship is so vaguely defined in the 1850s.  And then the other issue is nativism; there's a lot of people who are native-born Americans who question whether Irish immigrants can fully integrate and become a part of the American people.  So the Irish Americans and the African Americans are two separate populations but I think they are at the heart of this debate in the 1850s as to who comprises the American people and things like that.  They both have interesting wartime experiences with some similarities, not all that many, but there is still some interesting issues.  For instance, two groups of people now realizing an American allegiance, they're strengthening an American allegiance, and then both groups are at the heart of the redefinition of citizenship that takes place after the Civil War.  And they're not necessarily working in conjunction, but their activism together helps to redefine national citizenship: African Americans in terms of some issues, Irish Americans in terms of other issues.  When you look at the aggregate it’s a new definition of American citizenship that comes out of the early years of Reconstruction and African Americans and Irish Americans are right at the heart of that and it makes a lot of sense to look at them together during this time period. </p>
<p>
<b>CWBR:</b> With that in mind, would you consider the American Civil War as a watershed for citizenship and, as some scholars have suggested, the second American Revolution?</p>
<p>
<b>CS:</b>  I definitely think it’s a watershed for the history of American citizenship.  I mean the bottom line is in the 1850s, and even preceding that all through the pre-Civil War period, national citizenship was very vaguely defined and the fact of the matter is that most rights and privileges that we today associate with national citizenship were governed by the state.  And their decisions were based on a lot of different issues such as race and whether one was a native-born citizen or a naturalized citizen or things like that.  From the Civil War moment comes a completely different concept of national citizenship.  It's more important, rights start to be associated with it, there really becomes no distinction between being a naturalized citizen and a native-born citizen, save the constitutional one that you have to have been born in the United States to run for President and therefore Vice President.  As far as the Civil War being a second American Revolution, I think that’s a little bit more complicated of an issue.  I certainly think that the Civil War is critically important in American history.  It affects just about every facet of American life and government in some way and the American people really make critical choices during this time period that help create the United States that we know today.  I think, in some respect, the choices go back and affirm the principle of the first American Revolution and bring to fruition some of the ideals of the founders that still took some time to come to fruition.  But yeah I do think that was a huge break in some respect certainly in citizenship.  The developments in citizenship were a revolutionary moment so yeah it's a critically important watershed event in American history.</p>
<p> 
<b>CWBR:</b> You mention the Irish American apathy to the plight of the African American on a personal level.  What were Irish Americans saying about slavery in the 1850s?</p>
<p>
<b>CS:</b>  Well frankly, some Irish American leaders were apologists for slavery.  When you look at some of their writings especially Mitchell and people like that, some were apologists for slavery.  Other Irish American leaders turned a blind eye to it and I think it's a complicated nuanced history.  A lot of Irish Americans in northern cities were on the very low rungs of the socioeconomic ladder and the idea of emancipating slaves who might then come north and compete for jobs was a scary prospect for them. And so you had a lot of animosity between much of the Irish American community and much of the African American community in the urban North in a sense of competition both for jobs and also jostling on the low rungs of the social ladder.  And some of the ethnic leaders were making apologies for slavery so there certainly wasn't a large abolitionist component among Irish Americans.  Interestingly though, abolition was somewhat popular in Ireland and you can look at Irish leaders like O’Connell who did urge abolition of slavery and urged for greater human rights, including for blacks held in bondage. </p>
<p>
<b>CWBR:</b> Given the tradition of symbolic Irish nationalist leaders like, in the twentieth century, Patrick Henry Pearse and Michael Collins in Irish history, how important were military leaders like Thomas Meagher and Peter Welsh to the fight for and attainment of citizenship?</p>
<p>
<b>CS:</b>   I think they were very important.  When you look at Thomas Meagher and you look at figures such as Corcoran they really place their Civil War service and the Civil War service of Irish Americans at the heart of this new call that they belong in the American people.  And one of the elements of nativism was this idea that Irish immigrants would not be able to embrace the ideals of the American republic.  And early on, as soon as the war starts and Irish Americans start enlisting, you see speeches from Thomas Francis Meagher, a book published by Corcoran, letters home from people like Guiney (Patrick Robert Guiney) talking about the idea that this military service on the part of Irish Americans was vanquishing nativism and that proving that Irish Americans can still respect and embrace their ethnic identity but also be good American citizens and embrace the values of the republic.  And, in fact, that Irish Americans wanted to get those values in place in Ireland as well basically, not that we're as Irish Americans rejecting the values of American republicanism, but as Irish Americans we want to see those values in place in Ireland as well.  Now it’s interesting that you bring up Peter Welsh because he wasn't an ethnic leader; he was a carpenter living in New York who enlisted in a Massachusetts regiment.  What's fascinating with him is that you see in some letters home, and letters to his father-in-law where he is justifying his decision to enlist, he’s making some of the same arguments that the ethnic leaders are and he really seems to have embraced this idea that he’s serving, not only to help Ireland, and he’s serving, not only because the Union is a refuge for Irish immigrants, but also because the Union has to survive for republicanism worldwide to survive including hope for Ireland.  So it’s a very nuanced situation where Irish Americans are placing their service, saying hey by defending the Union we're also helping Ireland but we're also affirming our citizenship status here in the United States and we're also vanquishing nativism by showing that, yes we may be Irish and we may be Catholic, but we can also be good American citizens and defenders of American values and American constitutionalism.  The military service really does lie at the heart of the Irish American argument that helps diminish nativism in the years following the Civil War.</p>
<p> 
<b>CWBR:</b>  Turning attention to the African American experience, Richard Slotkin has recently written about the racial violence that resulted from the enlistment of African American soldiers.  After this enlistment, what role did race play in the war, especially at places like Fort Pillow and the battle of the Crater at Petersburg and how did African American soldiers change the war psychologically and ideologically?</p>
<p>
<b>CS:</b>  Well I think the African American experience really involves fighting on two fronts.  One is the military battlefield and then the other is the battle for equal rights and again, as soon as they're enlisting, African Americans are making the call for equal rights.  As far as combat performance there are moments showing that African Americans are equal in manhood and in combat abilities.  We see that it is probably most popularly depicted in the assault of fort Wagner in the movie Glory, in battles like Olustee in Florida and places like that so it really contradicts this idea that African Americans are children or are somehow inferior.  Against them, however, you see a lot of prejudice you see some prejudice in the American, in the Union army, you see some atrocities committed, such as your reference at Fort Pillow; you also have issues though where blacks contest unequal treatment.  The first civil rights victory won by black leadership and black protests is the unequal pay controversy which involves African American soldiers being paid less than their white counterparts and many blacks refused to accept any pay if it's going to be unequal to that of whites.  Massachusetts, for its regiments, the Massachusetts state house the legislature in Boston decides to appropriate money from the state to equalize pay and members of the 54th and 55th Massachusetts say: no we're not going to accept state pay because that's acknowledging a distinction, and so blacks lead a protest; sometimes it turns violent and involves some mutinies, a lot of discontent among the African American core, and it reaches the ears of Congress and eventually Congress comes around to equalize pay for African American soldiers.  And in other instances African American soldiers claim equality and say: we are no longer slaves, we are now freemen; we are fighting in the Union.  And that certainly percolates in the Reconstruction experience where now you have tens of thousands of black veterans who have experienced military service who have helped fight, not just for the Union, but also for the death of slavery, certainly a very powerful position, and it really leads into the call for equal rights and really defines citizenship.  And African Americans say: we don't just want freedom in name only, we want a freedom that actually means something, an enduring freedom with rights and the ability to participate in the economic life of the nation and the right to vote in elections and participate in the decision-making process of the republic.</p>
<p> 
<b>CWBR:</b> Do you think then that we can find origins of the civil rights movement in the Civil War?  You alluded to the unequal pay protest.  Would you suggest that some of those challenges and moments where they stood up for themselves played a role in sort of the early foundations of the civil rights movement following the war?</p>
<p>
<b>CS:</b>  Definitely, I think it operates on two levels, one is the theoretical level.  A lot of the arguments of the second civil rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s mirror the arguments that were made in the 1860s and 1870s so I think on a theoretical level certainly.  I think in terms of legal change a lot of the second civil rights movement was trying to get practical enjoyment of the rights won during the 1860s.  And then I also think on a personal level that African Americans held a candle against the darkness of Jim Crow and what I mean by that is African Americans in the 1890s and 1900s remembered the potential that took place during the 1860s and remembered the successes that took place in the 1860s where you had black legislators and black judges.  One of the justices on the South Carolina Supreme Court was African American.  You had African Americans serving in Congress and I think that the memory of that continued on over the decades.  And then, of course, the other thing that’s interesting there’s another parallel that both civil rights movements really come out of the wartime experience.  I mean when you look at the civil rights movement of the 1900s really turns into a mass movement coming out of World War II and the Korean War and the civil rights movement of the 1860s is coming obviously after the Civil War and black military participation there and so I think that there’s a parallel: two civil rights movements that really are sparked by black participation in war.</p>
<p>
<b>CWBR:</b> On Pages 112-113, you discuss Charles G. Halpine who became a leader in showing the democratic and Americanizing principles of the army to the Irish American community, even writing a song that the Grand Army of the Republic later adopted in the 1880s.  Was the army as an avenue to citizenship, in Halpine’s eyes, exclusive to white Americans?</p>
<p>
<b>CS:</b>  He was certainly a war Democrat and a lot of the war Democrats still didn't have a very egalitarian sense of African American inclusion.  And a lot of the war Democrats certainly weren't fighting for emancipation and for African Americans.  Having said that, it is interesting that you do find some Irish Americans undergoing conversions to become true Republicans.  Patrick Robert Guiney is an Irish-born Colonel who starts off the war as a Democrat when he enlists but he becomes a Republican and he really does become a Republican.  In his letters to his wife you see that he really has some respect for African Americans in promoting abolition.  And you see sometimes in early regimentals written by Irish Americans sometimes laughing a little bit at slaves they encounter in the South but also feeling bad for their experience and saying that emancipation was right and that no man should be in bondage.  And you even had some, its fascinating, you actually had some Irish Americans come around to want to serve as officers in the United States Colored Troops, which was the name of the corps of the African American soldiers, and certainly some of them wanted to have commissions and get out of the ranks in their regiments and have an officers commission.  But when you look at some of them, some of the letters and petitions, where they're saying: you know we would like to participate, they want to participate to help African Americans and after the war you actually see some moment of fluctuation where some Irish Americans do start to embrace the Republican agenda of broader human rights including for African Americans.  I mean not to put too broad of a stroke on it, and say that masses of Irish Americans are suddenly embracing the idea of equal rights for African Americans, but there’s certainly some fluctuation in Irish American hostility to the Republican agenda.</p>
<p> 
<b>CWBR:</b>  After the war, what role did Irish American citizenship play in the development of international naturalization and citizenship protocols?</p>
<p>
<b>CS:</b>  Well what happens is you have this situation where Britain adheres to a doctrine called perpetual allegiance and under perpetual allegiance if you're born a subject of Britain no act that you do can change the allegiance, that you’re always a subject to the Crown.  So, in other words, if you were born in Ireland and you travel to the United States and you naturalize in the United States, when you go back to Britain, Britain would look at you as a British subject not an American naturalized citizen.  What happens is the Irish nationalist movement, the Fenian Brotherhood, stars agitating after the Civil War.  Some Fenians go to Ireland, other Fenians invade Canada, and Britain starts making arrests and charging people as British subjects and some of them are not only Union war veterans but naturalized American citizens.  Well this creates widespread protests in the United States and what’s interesting is that it’s not just protest by Irish Americans but native-born Americans also join in.  And they call, in these protests and petitions to Congress; they call for the United States to defend American citizenship rights and the idea of expatriation rights.  And what expatriation rights were is the right to change your allegiance; its the right to immigrate and if you can find a country that will naturalize you, you can change your allegiance.  And in these waves of agitation, these mass meetings all across the country, in cities like Boston and New York and small towns, both Congress and the state department are pressured to pressure Britain to change its policy.  And eventually Britain does just that, eventually after tensions are very high and it’s in the context of other tensions, the Alabama claims and things like that, Britain agrees to move away from the doctrine of perpetual allegiance and to honor expatriation rights and naturalization.  So it actually does have a tremendous impact in international affairs where Britain abandons its centuries-old policy on naturalization and whether subjects could naturalize abroad.</p>
<p>
<b>CWBR:</b>  After the war, in the years following the conflict, how did Irish and African American experiences with the struggle for citizenship differ?</p>
<p>
<b>CS:</b>  Well I think on the biggest level African Americans are, in an initial matter, asking to be able to become citizens whereas naturalization was always open to Irish Americans.  African Americans are more concerned with gaining some level of rights and equality with whites; Irish Americans are more concerned with some of the identity aspects of citizenship, of being able to belong in the United States, and eliminating nativism and then they're more concerned with issues like this: being protected by the United States as naturalized citizens when they go abroad.  So Irish Americans aren't as concerned about parsing out the actual elements of citizenship or what rights are included in national citizenship, African Americans are because African Americans are calling for national citizenship that means something because they realize eventually the Republicans realize if you continue to let citizenship rights remain the province of the states some states are going to discriminate against blacks and not give equal rights.  So you get a moment where national citizenship starts to take primacy with the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and in the Civil Rights Act of 1866 it's defined that anyone born in the United States ,whether black or white, is a national citizen and as a national citizen they're entitled to certain rights and then it progresses from there you get the Fourteenth Amendment and things like that.  So African Americans are more concerned with the actual definition of what rights are included in national citizenship, you know, A: that they are national citizens and B: what that includes.  Irish Americans are more concerned with equalizing naturalized citizenship and more concerned with being protected when they go abroad as naturalized citizens.</p>
<p>
<b>CWBR:</b> Did the federal government fail, then, to follow through on civil rights following the Civil War?  Why do we see the backlash, especially against African Americans, during and after Reconstruction?</p>
<p>
<b>CS:</b>  Well you know that question really is: what caused the death of Reconstruction and I think it's a number of things.  I think a little bit is naivety and what I mean by that is thinking that southerners would not have as much of a backlash as they had to the idea of equal rights for blacks.  I think part of it is that the army demobilizes very quickly so you don't have a lot of troops in the South to be able to put down the Ku Klux Klan.  A lot of the branch of the armed services that would be best-suited for fighting the Klan, the Calvary, isn't really stationed in the South; it's stationed now in the western frontier in the last wave of the wars against the Native Americans.  And I think a lot of it is simply exhaustion.  By the 1870s we have a United States that dealt with the tensions of the 1850s, the bloodshed and destruction of the Civil War, the turmoil of Reconstruction during the second half of the 1860s, and by the early 1870s, they think a lot of northerners, even some Republicans, the liberal Republicans, are simply getting exhausted and saying: we've given blacks national citizenship, we've given them the right to vote, they need to start being able to defend themselves.  And there was an unwillingness to go through expanding the army and paying for an expansion in the army and things like that to really combat the realities that were going on in the South and the violence of southern white racism.  And I think what it really was, was a sense of exhaustion that grew in the North to finally start turning a blind eye to what was going on in the South.  They also had other turmoil, you have to remember, as the 1870s go on, labor starts to become the big issue.  If the 1860s are defined by issues of race, I think the 1870s are defined by issues of labor and strikes and violence like that and fear of socialism.  Concerns like that start to take more and more center stage and the race issue starts to diminish.  And certainly a lot of Republicans who are still very passionate about the issue, but they're eventually going to lose out and become subsumed and then eventually you get the rise of Jim Crow and by the turn of the century the promise of those laws and the promise of all that legal change they're still on the books but not being able to be enjoyed and practiced by the African Americans.</p>

<h3>Interviewed by Nathan Buman</h3>
<p>
<p>
<b><i>Civil War Book Review (CWBR):</i></b> Today, I’m joined by Eric Foner who is DeWitt Clinton Professor of History at Columbia University to discuss his Pulitzer Prize-winning <i>The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery</i>.  Professor Foner, congratulations on your award and thank you for joining me.</p>
<p>
<b>Eric Foner (EF):</b> Thank you very much; I'm happy to talk to you</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> What inspired you to take this approach to looking at Abraham Lincoln?</p>
<p>
<b>EF:</b> Well obviously, as you know, there are enumerable books about Lincoln out there already, many of them are, of course excellent books.  I feel that in recent years, with some important exceptions, there's been a tendency in some of the literature to sort of focus so specifically on Lincoln that the wider world slips from view sometimes, that, in a sense, my feeling is Lincoln needed to be put back in political context, particularly in this one area: that my book is about Lincoln and slavery; it's not a total biography.  It's about Lincoln and the evolution of his ideas about slavery, policies about slavery, and I did feel that there was still something to be said tracing out how Lincoln’s attitudes and views changed over the course of his life: how he related to other people in the whole broad anti-slavery firmament.  So, I guess, I felt there was room even though there is such a large body of literature already about slavery, about Lincoln</p> 
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> You mention placing him in that overall world and I wonder: is seems like you suggest that we can often see certain aspects of Lincoln in ourselves.  Does examining the personal  growth during his life, in terms of how he looked at government, slavery, and society, make him more approachable?  Does it remove some of the mystique, making him more human?</p>
<p>
<b>EF:</b> Well, I hope so.  I mean Lincoln was a man of greatness; he grew into greatness.  I don't think he was a great figure for all of his life and I think we can learn something from how Lincoln related to broad social movements of his time: abolitionism, other forms of critique of slavery, which he was not really part of, but he was willing to learn from them, and I think just the notion of a statesman who is open to new ideas, who is intellectually curious, who is willing to change-of course, in the greatest crisis in our nation’s history- is something we can learn from: that people should not be totally set in their ways, totally inflexible.  Today, if a politician changes his view about something he is immediately denounced as a flip-flopper, right?  Lincoln was a flip-flopper; he changed enormously, in some regards: in terms of policy about slavery, attitudes about race.  Another way of putting it is he learned, he grew, he understood that new ideas were valuable.  So the notion today seems to be that anyone who learns anything, that's to be criticized and condemned because they're not holding exactly the same positions throughout their whole life.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> How important was an ideological base in Revolutionary politics and the ideology of the Founding Fathers to Lincoln’s political foundation?</p>
<p>
<b>EF:</b> Well Lincoln, of course, greatly admired the founding fathers as most people of his generation did.  In that famous Lyceum speech when he was still a young man in the late 1830s, he sort of said, well what have the Founding Fathers left for us to do, so to speak?  They created this, what he considered the last, best hope of man, this democratic system of government, and, in a sense, they had usurped what subsequent generations might do to achieve notoriety and greatness.  But ,of course, Lincoln felt that-he believed-(this is open to some criticism) but he believed that the founders had set the country on a course toward the eventual abolition of slavery and he felt that their policies were being overturned particularly in the 1850s by Stephen A. Douglas and those pressing for the expansion of slavery.  And so, on the one hand, Lincoln claims to be, in a sense, a conservative; he's going back to the original purposes of the revolution.  But, in doing so, you're radically altering the system that has existed since that time.  He said that the nation cannot exist forever half slave and half free.  Well, it had existed half slave and half free for well over 50 years.   So on the one hand he says he's going back to the views of the founders; on the other hand he's really trying to change the fundamental nature of American society because of his anti-slavery commitments.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> Well placing Lincoln, then, in the overall society, did Lincoln’s unique upbringing in Kentucky and Illinois, on the edge of slaveholding society, give him a distinctive perspective into intersectional politics and dealing with the South during secession and war?</p>
<p>
<b>EF:</b>  Well, of course, Lincoln, as you well know, was born in Kentucky, a slave state.  He grew up in southern Indiana and then southern and central Illinois, areas settled mostly, at that time, by people from the South.  He married into a Kentucky family, so he obviously had very close personal connections with the South and, in some ways, with slave society.  And I think that that gave him a sense of…he didn't denounce southerners.  He didn't denounce slave owners the way some abolitionists did; he never said that they are sinners, that kind of thing.  In fact, he said in one of his speeches that if we were in their position we would be pretty much doing the same things they are.  But I think that during the war one of his problems may have been, at least in the secession crisis, that he overestimated the degree of support for the Union in the South.  He sort of felt that secessionism was a minority movement, was almost like a conspiracy of a small group.  And he believed that there was this strong latent Unionism in the South that would eventually rear its head and end secession.  That, of course, did not turn out to be the case so maybe, in that sense, on the one hand, his personal connections with southerners made him less likely to engage in a kind of vitriolic denunciation; on the other hand it may have led him to overestimate the degree of Unionism.  After all Kentucky was not your typical slave state: Kentucky remained in the Union, it was divided his wife's family, his father-in-law ,who died in 1849 I think, was strongly pro-Union.  Henry Clay, the great Kentucky statesman who Lincoln admired so much, was pro-Union and Lincoln may have somewhat extended those views to the rest of the South in a way that didn't turn out to be totally accurate. </p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> Once Lincoln was elected, was there an honest opportunity for compromise in your opinion?</p>
<p>
<b>EF:</b> You know, it's interesting,  Lincoln admired Cay enormously but Clay made his reputation, of course, as the Great Compromiser.  Lincoln, in the secession crisis, refused to compromise.  He said he is perfectly willing to compromise on peripheral issues, but not on the core question which was the westward expansion of slavery.  On that, he said I am not compromising so Lincoln was willing to risk war even in the face in the secession crisis.  So I think Lincoln was able (and this is another lesson for statesmen) to clearly differentiate, in his own mind, between core principles, which he wouldn't compromise, and other issues which he was willing to compromise.  So, if Lincoln’s only aim, as some people seem to think was to preserve the Union, he could have easily preserved the Union by just giving in to the South, no problem.  Give the South what they want, let them expand slavery, and then the Union is saved.  What's the problem here?  But Lincoln said no; it must be a Union worth saving, a Union in which slavery is confined and put in, what he calls, the course toward ultimate extinction.  And that's your fundamental problem there; if you don't compromise on that you're not going to settle the secession crisis.</p>
<p>
<i><b>CWBR:</b></i> How does one reconcile the fact that many white southerners mark Lincoln’s election as a blow to slavery with the fact that many abolitionists like Garrison worry that Lincoln is not radical enough?  What does that tell us about the complicated task that Lincoln faced?</p>
<p>
<b>EF:</b> Lincoln was not an abolitionist; he didn't claim to be an abolitionist.  Abolitionists were often very critical of Lincoln.  On the other hand, people like Garrison, Wendell Phillips, and Frederick Douglas hailed Lincoln’s election as a step in the right direction.  They said no, this is not going to end slavery just like that, but it's definitely a step in the right direction.  Simon P. Chase, who was an abolitionist although a republican politician, says this is the culmination of my life’s work-Lincoln’s election-the slave power, southern slave owners, have been expelled from control of the federal government.  So, even though abolitionist felt Lincoln was not nearly as radical as they wanted, southerners (white southerners, secessionists) feared that Lincoln’s election marked a fundamental shift in power in the country.  They didn't think that Lincoln was going to sign an emancipation proclamation as soon as he came to office; he had no legal grounds for doing that, and he made it clear he wasn't going to do it.  But, in the longer run, this seemed to be to them a sign of the northern states now acquiring control of the national government and they felt slavery would not be safe ultimately under the rule of people who were hostile to slavery.  So that's why they seceded.  Read the South Carolina Declaration of the Causes of Secession, they don't beat around the bush; that's what they say: slavery is no longer safe with the election of Lincoln.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> What role did the Union military play in forcing Lincoln to define or clarify his policy on slavery and what role did the slaves themselves play in that?</p>
<p>
<b>EF:</b> At the outset of the war, of course, Lincoln says that this is not a war about slavery; it's a war about preserving the Union.  Four slave states, the Border States, remain in the Union; Lincoln was very concerned about maintaining their loyalty.  But very quickly the government has to take cognizance of slavery.  The first thing is slaves run away.  Wherever the Union Army goes, slaves start running toward Union lines and the army has got a dilemma.  At the beginning they start returning these slaves but many soldiers don't want to do that.  They're not in the army to be fugitive slave hunters and, moreover, many of those slaves have been used as laborers for the Confederate Army and why send them back to build fortifications against your own forces?  So this forces the Lincoln administration to start making policy about slavery and in 1861 they do it in a modest sort of way.  By 1862, in the spring when they capture the southern part of Louisiana, they're in control of an area with many, many thousands of slaves and so the slaves put the issue on the agenda so to speak by their own actions.  And then the army has to deal with it.  The army says: well what are we supposed to do?  We can't just start capturing slaves and sending them back; it is distasteful, it's counterproductive.  Sometimes slaves have very valuable information about the disposition of Confederate forces or the local terrain or things like that which they bring to Union commanders and they say: well we just can't send this guy back into slavery now that he's been helpful to us.  So that's a couple of, among many, of pressures that are pushing Lincoln toward a new policy on slavery. </p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> How did the Emancipation Proclamation alter the course of the war and might the Proclamation be indicative of a general shift toward total war?</p>
<p>
<b>EF:</b> Well I think the Proclamation does fundamentally change the nature of the war because it makes slavery officially a target of the Union war effort.  Henceforth, after January 1, 1863, wherever the Union Army goes, one of its responsibilities, as Lincoln says in that document, is to protect and maintain the freedom of about 3.2 million (more or less) slaves who were declared free under the terms of the Emancipation Proclamation.  So it guarantees that, if the Union wins the war (which, of course, is an “if;” it's not guaranteed) then slavery will end, no question about it.  Even though it doesn't apply to Kentucky, it doesn't apply to Maryland, if slavery dies in South Carolina, Mississippi, and Alabama, it's not going to be able to survive all that long in Missouri and Delaware.  So it really does change the nature of the war and, indeed, of American society.  It means that now the issue on the agenda is going to be: what is going to be the status of these millions of slaves who are now being declared free people?  What's going to happen to them in American society?  Are they going to enjoy the same rights as white people?  Are they going to be in the same labor system?  So it opens up a lot of important questions, even though it sort of points toward solving the question of slavery, per se and so I think it does very much change the nature of the war.  And also of course the Proclamation, for the first time, officially announces that black soldiers (black men) will be allowed to enlist in the Union Army and I think the service of the 200,000 black soldiers and sailors by the end of the war does have a very big effect on racial attitudes.  Even Lincoln, himself, comes to feel that these people who fought for the Union have stake to claim for citizenship in the post-war world.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> What effect did Lincoln’s increasing use of emancipation as a war aim, as the war progressed, have on public support leading up to the 1864 election?  Without Sherman’s victory at Atlanta, was a loss to McClellan possible?</p>
<p>
<b>EF:</b> Well certainly in August of 1864 Lincoln believed he was going to lose; many Republicans thought Lincoln was going to lose the election.  There was a great deal of war weariness in the North; casualties in 1864 were enormous compared to the rest of the war.  Even though there had been Union victories, important ones previously, (Gettysburg and Vicksburg) still it seemed to be a sort of stalemate in the East and there was a lot of fear that war weariness would lead to the election of General McClellan, the Democrat.  In August 1864 Henry Raymond, the editor of the <i>New York Times</i>, and some other Republicans came to Lincoln and said: people think the Emancipation Proclamation is prolonging the war because they'll never come back unless they can keep their slaves.  Why don't you say that we'll accept the South back with their slaves if they just give up the war?  Rescind the Emancipation Proclamation, basically, that will, at least boost, your chances of re-election because, if they say no, it will prove that the Proclamation is not the reason the war is continuing.  And Lincoln seems to have thought about it a bit over night but then he said: I can't really do that.  First of all, it would just be wrong to promise people freedom and then rescind the promise.  Second of all, we need those black soldiers; if we do this the black soldiers will lay down their arms and without them we can't win the war.  So he was wedded to emancipation by then, even at the possible price of losing the election.  Then, as you said, Sherman’s capture of Atlanta seems to have turned the tide in terms of public sentiment and he is elected eventually by a very large margin.  But basically once the Proclamation is issued, Lincoln is not going to go back on it and, even though some radicals thought he was too slow in issuing it, once it's issued, this is it.  This is now the policy of the Union and he is not going to change.</p> 
<p>
<b><i>CWBR:</i></b> What was Lincoln’s vision for American society in the post-war period and how did his vision evolve or change from his antebellum ideas of an American society with or without slavery?</p>
<p>
<b>EF:</b> We know very little about what was Lincoln thinking about the post-war world; obviously he was assassinated April 1865 when Reconstruction is really just beginning.  There were various plans of Reconstruction put forward during the Civil War but these were plans for winning the war, not a blueprint for the post-war South.  And certainly, in his final speech, just before his death he talked about maybe limited black suffrage in the South, which is something he had never publicly spoken of before so I think his ideas were changing and evolving.   I don't think Lincoln had a blueprint at all.  I think he wanted a relatively quick reunion of the country; he was not vindictive toward white southerners.  On the other hand, I think he recognized, by this point, that the former slaves had a claim on the conscience of the nation and you couldn't just abandon them and let them be put back into some kind of system akin to slavery again.  How to work that out, how to bring the white South in and yet protect the rights of the black South was a gigantic dilemma which Congress will be wrestling with for several years after this.  Of course, the problem was that, once Lincoln is assassinated, you get probably the worst president in American history, Andrew Johnson, replacing him who is totally incapable of confronting this question at all in any serious way and that complicates the situation very dramatically.</p>

<h3>Interviewed by Nathan Buman</h3>
<p>
<p><b><i>Civil War Book Review (CWBR)</i>:</b> Today, <i>Civil War Book Review</i> is proud to speak with Adam Arenson, Professor of History at University of Texas at El Paso about his recent work, <i>The Great Heart of the Republic: St. Louis and the Cultural Civil War</i>.  Professor Arenson, I appreciate you taking the time to speak with us.</p>
<p>
<b>Adam Arenson (AA):</b> It’s my pleasure</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR</i>:</b> I was struck by your timeline.  How did you decide to begin your narrative in the 1840s and conclude with the St. Louis World’s Fair and Olympic Games in 1904?</p>
<p><b>AA:</b> I found that they actually match very well with these national events that we often think of as the beginning and ending of the Civil War era: the end of the U.S. war with Mexico in 1848 and the Tilden-Hayes Election that is over with the semi-compromise of 1877.  It was fascinating to see how these local and national events were in conversation, for example, the fire in 1849.  That’s a random event; in May 1849 there is a spark that catches from one steamboat to another and burns down a lot of downtown in St. Louis.  But that turns out to be a great thing for the merchants of St. Louis because they are able to change their trade patterns from being about a North-South trade to New Orleans and old French patterns into a new East-West trade that takes advantage of their new position as a gateway to the West.  Similarly, with Forest Park, the fact that Governor Tilden of New York is in St. Louis in 1876 to be named the Democratic national nominee at the National Convention, that fact that they take a break from that convention to go out and dedicate Forest Park, I think it tied together these two moments where the national conversation is shifting very dramatically and the fact that both the Tilden-Hayes Election and the election to split the city and county of St. Louis end up very contested.  There is a lot of discussion of fraud and they are basically both decided by extra-electoral decision making, that was another thing that helped me to see that these events could be tied together and help close the story.</p>
<p><b><i>CWBR</i>:</b> You discussed how insurance policies helped businessmen and women rebuild St. Louis after the great fire of 1849, describing the fire as their opportunity to start anew. How common were insurance policies during the period and how significantly did the decision to purchase insurance on one’s business and inventory play into the rebuilding of St. Louis?</p>
<p><b>AA:</b> What I found was that, right at the top or northern part of the waterfront, what you have is a number of the city’s most wealthy individuals.  They’re French fur-trading families and they have a lot of investments in various places and I think, because they were well-connected to other trading centers, to the uncertainties of the steamboat trade, and to the fur trade rendezvous, they seemed to be better connected to the insurance markets.  My analysis shows that, on the southern part of the fire, that was the area where it was more working-class, in modern terms.  And those individuals, not only were they not able to save their belongings, because the whole city had rushed to save the northern part of the city, but they also were not people who were insured.  And that area is emptied out, not because they’re able to rebuild with insurance money, but because they have to go live with relatives or other people.  So, there’s two sets of change happening along the river: the northern part that is able to capitalize on the fact of the fire and the southern part who are really victims of it.  And so it was interesting to see these two effects of the fire right in two different neighborhoods along the riverfront. </p> 
<p><b><i>CWBR</i>:</b> It seemed to me that Thomas Hart Benton had a pretty firm grasp on the future and he understood the consequences of politics and the future of slavery?  How was this insight possible and what did it mean for his career?</p>

<p><b>AA:</b> Benton was born in North Carolina but at an early age he had moved west and he saw a rise of the West as the thing that would raise his fortunes in the country.  He was instrumental in the statehood debate and the Missouri Compromise that allowed Missouri to join as a state and then, from 1821, he was in the U.S. Senate representing Missouri and what he understood was the interest of the greater West.  The introduction of the book talks about the three sides of the Civil War and this effort to see North, South, and West, not just North and South.  That is something that Benton really exemplifies along with a lot of other figures who we often think of as being on opposite sides: people like Abraham Lincoln, Jefferson Davis, and Henry Clay.  Some of them ended up in different political parties but there is kind of a western agenda that all of them are pushing, thinking that the railroad, if it reaches out, first if they gain the continent, as they do in 1848 and then, once they can reach the Pacific, once they build that railroad, the politics, economics, and culture of the country will change pretty dramatically because of the differences in the West.  They’re not so worried about slavery; they’re not so worried about tariffs and some of these eastern concerns because they think, once the mining riches of the West and the natural riches of the West, and certain other interests out on the Pacific become the center of national attention, then the West will really rise and these eastern concerns will matter a lot less.  I think Benton is probably the person in American history who embodies that in one of the most powerful ways, especially for a politician rather than someone who is an adventurer, someone like Kit Carson.</p>
<p><b><i>CWBR</i>:</b> How did city leaders reconcile their desire that St. Louis be a beacon for growth, progress, and the American ideal in the future with the fact that immigrants from Europe were flooding the city and fueling this growth in the first place?  Was St. Louis another “city on a hill?”</p>

<p><b>AA:</b> This is another area where the unusual demographics of St. Louis play in.  It’s a city that has a large northern population and also a growing German population who are often free labor, free soil advocates, yet it’s a large city on the border of slavery and freedom in a slave state, in this exceptional geographic location of Missouri after the Missouri Compromise.  And so you have individuals from all of the different communities investing in the railroad; you have French fur-trading families who often held slaves investing in the railroad.  You have the Germans; you have those from the Northeast.  And part of what they thought is, like we can see later with Stephen Douglas and the Kansas-Nebraska Act, is that they saw the building of the railroad as linked to something that would dramatically change the way that slavery would function.  And so I see some of their support for popular sovereignty-the idea that, as you move into the territory, the people of the territory themselves will determine if slavery is necessary or not-I think that they see that, as railroads are this transformative technology, they’re going to change the reality of living in these communities and only then will we know if slavery needs to continue or not.  Looking back, we know that’s a little optimistic, that slavery was a little more entrenched than they seemed to believe, but I think that really motivated their policy; they really thought the railroad would solve all.</p>
<p><b><i>CWBR</i>:</b> How were the slavery debates problematic for the supporters of the Transcontinental Railroad in St. Louis?  Was this an indication that some semblance of unity is necessary to achieve national goals?</p>
<p><b>AA:</b> There’s definitely language that puts forth St. Louis as this great national city, this place that the whole country should look to.  The most prominent moment where that happens is the founding of Washington University as this national, non-sectarian, non-political driven place that would be a beacon to education in the country.  They talk of themselves as being the Harvard or Yale of the West, two years after they’re founded, before they even have a building.  Later, during Reconstruction, there’s also an effort to move the national capital to St. Louis and they think that’s, among other things, a nice gesture of sectional reconciliation.  It will be in a place that is North, South, and West and not in Washington which they see as peripheral to the newly continental nation.  So there are definitely ways in which St. Louis is trying to put forward itself as a global city.  One of the pamphlets that’s written for the Capital Removal Campaign, is called “St. Louis: The Future Great City of the World” and so they are very much embracing the German immigrants, the Irish immigrants, and others as coming to a city that’s on the rise, that they’re willing to take the best of the world and make it into what they see as the promise of the United States for the whole continent and then trade with the world as well.  </p>
<p><b><i>CWBR</i>:</b> On Page 138 you make the statement that “Missouri’s condition was so stable that the principles for postwar government could already be considered in June 1862.”  What, if anything, did President Lincoln and his administration learn from their experiences in St. Louis?</p>
<p><b>AA:</b> What you see in St. Louis is, in May 1861 there is a skirmish at Camp Jackson as the Confederate-leaning state militia gather and then Union troops, along with a number of German volunteers, surround them and get them to surrender.  That’s really the only kind of battle in St. Louis.  What you see after that is the building of gunboats, the training of troops, including lots of U.S. Colored Troops, the caring for wounded and refugees from both sides, as well as new schools for African Americans, and a pretty strong presence for the Provost Marshall to keep the Confederate sympathizers at bay, but also not to expel them, not to remove them from the economy.  So I think that balancing act, that effort to make sure the city is still a place of North, South, and West is what makes it an interesting model for thinking about wartime reconstruction.   What does Lincoln gain from it, on the other hand?  I think a lot of the examples are in the negative.  General Fremont puts forward a proclamation in his efforts to deal with the Confederates in the western Missouri, where he is going to start emancipating slaves in 1861.  Lincoln immediately shuts that down; Fremont is eventually removed.  There are other examples where St. Louis gets ahead of what Lincoln thinks is prudent for the whole country and so he wants to be a little more cautious of it.  On the other hand, Fremont works with William Greenleaf Eliot to create the Western Sanitary Commission and its as active as the U.S. Sanitary Commission out of Philadelphia in being the relief organization for the sick and wounded and refugees.  And so that’s an important part of the picture and the Sanitary Fair that they hold in 1864 gathers signatures and mementoes from heroes and notables all through, not only the West, but the country as a whole.  Nelly Grant, General Grant’s daughter is instrumental in selling a number of raffle tickets for important items too.  So that’s an interesting moment that thinks about how the home front notables, in ways, were connected to the military leaders as well.  </p>
<p><b><i>CWBR</i>:</b> What were some of the challenges that St. Louisans faced that made their Reconstruction experience unique to the rest of the country?</p>

<p><b>AA:</b> They had been a Union city in a border state, sort of nervously held for the Union so they’re dealing with the aftermath of a slave society as much as the South is, but the city is not destroyed.  They hadn’t been a place of battles in a way that Richmond and other places were so you have some of the political issues that faced the former Confederacy but the economic possibility that the North and South are experiencing during Reconstruction.  You have the mix of things going on and so I highlight both the success of people linked to St. Louis in creating Lincoln University, which is the school for African Americans founded by ex-U.S. Colored Troops, really a unique case in that way and also the first permanent memorial to Abraham Lincoln anywhere in the country.  On the other hand, this capital removal effort, though it looks like something that is trying to bring everyone together and bring the national attention to St. Louis, as it falls apart, very quickly it becomes clear that these are individuals who are willing to leave African-American civil rights question behind as they think about ways to reintegrate ex-Confederates and they sort of reinvigorate the Democratic Party through people like Frank Blair and Benjamin Gratz Brown, Missourians become very active in what ends up stalling, and eventually reversing, the advances of Reconstruction.</p>
<p><b><i>CWBR</i>:</b> You close your book with the quote, describing St. Louis as “impossible or visionary, unfortunate or impractical,” and suggest that this might be a broad model for the general cultural civil war at the center of U.S. history.  What can we take from your analysis of St. Louis that we can apply to our broader understanding of American history?</p>

<p><b>AA:</b> Well, the period, I would say following, even the War of 1812 forward to the firing on Fort Sumter, that period is a period of really vast dreams for the United States.  You have people like Ralph Waldo Emerson and Walt Whitman making poetic or artistic goals but you also have people like Thomas Hart Benton or the filibusterer, William Walker, making territorial goals, thinking about this is what we’re going to do when we integrate the West, this is what we are going to do when we integrate Nicaragua, Cuba, or other places that the United States doesn’t take in this period.  So, there are so many wild dreams and, the fact that many of them succeed, we often don’t think of how impossible some of these goals were.  When the question over slavery becomes paramount and the war begins, you begin to see a recalculation of how people think about the role of these broad ideas in their own lives.  In a book like Louis Menand’s <i>The Metaphysical Club</i> you see the effect of the fighting on some of the deepest thinkers in the country.  What I’m trying to do is bring the political story and the cultural story together in that way.  You see the success of some wild dreams in St. Louis-their work on the railroad, the success of Washington University-but you also see their failure of something like the moving of the national capital and the way in which they set up a large urban park that doesn’t really allow them to recapture the national imagination quite as they hoped.  And I think that those contradictions between really broad claims and the realities of the society that is dealing with the end of slavery is really something that shapes much of nineteenth-century U.S. history in places far beyond St. Louis.</p>

<h3>Interviewed by Nathan Buman</h3>
<p>
<p><b><i>Civil War Book Review </i>(<i>CWBR</i>):</b>Today, I’m discussing with Professor William J. Cooper, Jr., his newly-published <i>We Have the War Upon Us: The Onset of the Civil War, December 1860-April 1861</i>.  Professor Cooper, thank you for joining us today.<p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR</i>:</b> You examine the failure of the Democratic National Convention when it met in Charleston as a signal of the splintering of the Democratic Party.  Surely the Democrats understood what their failure meant nationally; why couldn’t northern and southern Democrats compromise to oppose the Republicans who faced a much easier task in an election against a broken Democratic Party?</p>
<p>
<p><b>William J. Cooper, Jr. (WJC):</b> Well the Democratic Party had two problems.  The first problem was Stephen A. Douglas who was an anathema to the southerners, and the southerners were determined to stop him.  They thought they had a good chance to do so because of the two-thirds rule requiring two-thirds of the delegates to nominate a candidate.  Moreover, the more moderate southern leaders like Jefferson Davis, for example, wanted the convention to move toward nominations before a platform. They wanted to get a candidate in place and then get a platform, but the more radical southerners wanted a platform first because they wanted to force Douglas to come towards them or to beat Douglas at his own game.  And those people led by William Lowndes Yancey of Alabama forced through a platform regarding slavery in the territories that the Douglas people could not and would not accept.  Though the platform committee voted for that platform, or that plank, because the vote was by states.  Once the radical southerners pressed the others on the platform committee went along with them.  But when it went before the full convention it was voted down, and at that point Yancey lead a walk-out.  Now most scholars don’t think Yancey wanted to break up the Democratic Party, that he wanted to come back as a kind of hero, a king maker.  Well he didn’t come back, and other southern states that walked out with him didn’t come back because they weren’t asked to do so.  The Douglas people in Charleston thought that they could get him nominated but the ruling was made by the convention chair that it took two-thirds of all the delegates, not just those remaining; thus they didn’t get what they wanted and the convention adjourned, agreeing to meet again in Baltimore.  It met and it was the same difficulty even compounded because some of the southern states sent old delegations and some sent new delegations.  The party came apart.  It came apart both on the southern antipathy to Douglas and on radical southern demands that northerners wouldn’t accept.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR</i>:</b> You mention Yancey from Alabama, but you state that “Fire-eaters considered [at one point] the Palmetto State their citadel, the stronghold where they exercised enormous influence.”  How and why did South Carolina ascend to this status instead of any of the other Deep South states?</p>
<p>
<p><b> (WJC):</b> I’ll do the best I can with that.  That’s a vexing question that numerous historians have addressed, and none have come to a conclusion that satisfies more than a handful of individuals.  Why South Carolina became so radical and stayed so radical so long is very hard to understand.  The political organization of the state which gave great power to the legislature and still required property qualifications to sit in it, the absence of a two-party system which was chiefly due to John C. Calhoun’s dominance of the state during the formative period of the Democratic and Whig Parties, the overwhelming domination of the state by large planters, the fact that the state had been majority black for so long, all of these come together.  And of course South Carolina was a nullifying state in the 1830s and wanted to secede in 1850, but even the radicals of the state decided that someone needed to go first because they had been alone once before yet they could not get anybody else to go out so secession in South Carolina came apart.  In 1860 they still wanted someone to go out first-most of them-but they couldn’t get anybody to take that step.  But when they thought they got promises that some would follow especially Georgia, the radicals in the legislature in the state succeeded in getting the state to go out.  It’s very difficult to understand because amongst the chief radicals were some of the richest people in America: the rice and Sea Island cotton planters on both sides of Charleston on the sea coast,  people who were absolutely vulnerable if any military conflict should occur.  And when that did occur one of the first places that fell to Union forces was around Beaufort, South Carolina, a radical bastion and a center of very wealthy planters.  My answer is not very satisfactory because I don’t think a satisfactory answer exists at this point.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR</i>:</b> It seems that the Radicals-we mentioned those fire-eaters in the South, but also those hard-liner Republicans in the North- that they are the ones that scooped up any potential undecided support during the secession crisis.  Why couldn’t the Border Conservatives, as you call them, garner more support for compromise and patience during the secession crisis?</p>
<p>
<p><b> (WJC):</b> The Border Conservatives failed because they failed to move the leadership of the Republican Party.  And I spend a lot of time in this book talking about the struggle of Border Conservatives.  They had an ally in the Republican Party, William Henry Seward.  I’m persuaded that Seward wanted to make a deal, that he would have made a deal had it been within his power, but Lincoln said no and Seward pushed Lincoln as far as he thought he could.  He did urge Lincoln to adopt a more conservative, more conciliatory course, even down to Fort Sumter when he wanted Lincoln to remove the federal garrison.  But he never got too far in front of Lincoln, he never wanted to alienate Lincoln.  The failure of the Border Conservatives to convince Lincoln that he needed to move toward their position guaranteed that the Republican Party would not move.  Nothing would have moved the Republican hard-liners but, if Lincoln had moved, the great center of the party would have followed him.  I am persuaded of that.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR</i>:</b> It almost feels, at times like politics got away from the political giants of the day, specifically William Seward and Jefferson Davis, who preached caution and union.  How did the people on the ground, the hard-liner Republicans and the Fire-eaters successfully achieve the plunge into secession and war?</p>
<p>
<p><b> (WJC):</b> Well let’s go to the South first.  Secession followed the election of Lincoln.  Fire-eaters had been preaching secession to break up the Union, for so long, but they advocated a doctrine that asked southerners to step into the unknown, to take a giant step away from something they knew into something that they didn’t know.  Now the fire-eaters proclaimed that this was going to be the political Garden of Eden, the land of milk and honey.  But southerners weren’t sure and southerners were loyal Americans; they embraced the United States.  They looked to the great American heroes as their own heroes.  Leaving the country, leaving the United States was not a step they would take easily but with Republicans in charge, now the fire-eaters ask: what’s going to happen with the Republican administration?  So now you’ve got the unknown of secession matched with the unknown of what a Republican would do.  What men like Jefferson Davis wanted was some signal from the Republicans that they were going to respect what a person like him thought of as southern rights.  And that meant to say that the southerners had a constitutional right, not only to own slaves in Mississippi, but a constitutional right to share in the national territory, in the national property .  Davis didn’t demand a slave code for the territories but he did demand a constitutional right.  He was quite willing-and men like him were quite willing-to make compromises on territorial alignments, but on the fundamental right he wanted Republican acquiescence or recognition.  He thought that if he had that he could go back to Mississippi and to the rest of the South and say: look, they recognize our rights.  When he couldn’t get that, the fire- eaters had him in a box; if he wanted to retain, if men like him wanted to retain, any power and prestige in their states they were forced to go in that direction.  Likewise, in the North, the hardline Republicans said: we will never make any deals, we will never make any compromise.  While their number was a minority within their party, the president- elect, the man who was to be the leader of their party, stood with them on that particular issue.  We must remember that, despite the fire-eaters in the South and the hard-liners in the North, a large pro-compromise element did exist and that group included northerners and southerners, anti-slave and pro-slave alike who sought to maintain the Union despite sectional differences. In my judgment Lincoln’s failure in this crisis was that he never said anything publicly about what he would and wouldn’t do.  He never stood up and told southerners that he would be president of all Americans, that he and they were different but also alike.  Lincoln had an enormous gift for fitting political language and one can imagine the kind of statement he would have made.  It might very well have quieted some of the southern concern but he didn’t’ do it.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR</i>:</b> On pages 72-73, you discuss a shift in Lincoln’s approach to compromise, noting that he supported the Compromise of 1850 publicly but within a decade of that support, “Lincoln unequivocally opposed compromise even as the Union came apart.”  What accounts for this adjustment in his viewpoint?</p>
<p>
<p><b> (WJC):</b> Well I think that there are two things.  This is a general position on Lincoln and compromise, but I think you have to be a little more specific and look at Lincoln at this particular instance between his election and his taking office, why he was so adamantly opposed then.  And I think that there are three reasons, and I talk about them in my book at some length.  First, he was ignorant of the South; he had no southern political friends, really no southern friends of any kind except a few in Kentucky.  He didn’t know anything about the Deep South politics; also he didn’t understand the society of the Deep South.  I don’t think he had any recognition of how deeply slavery had become embedded, how white southerners, no matter whether they thought slavery was good or bad, were committed to it.  Committed to their slave society, they wanted no interference with it.  They feared that he was going to interfere with them.  I don’t believe he stopped to think, when he said this country can’t continue half-slave and half-free, how southerners might react when he says something like that.   Second, Lincoln approached this whole problem as a Republican partisan, I think he had just become party leader.  He knew Seward, for example, had more national stature than he did even after his election, and he knew that many Republicans still looked to Seward.  He wanted to establish himself as the party leader.  He was very concerned about what he saw as the fragility of the Republican coalition, that he was the first elected Republican president and he feared that if he moved toward conciliation, toward any serious compromise, that he would alienate the hard-liners, the left wing of his party, who might bolt.  In contrast, Seward who had been a spokesman for antislavery politics for a decade, first as a Whig, then as a Republican, had a standing to face those people head-on if they came after him, and he suspected that they would. But where would they go if the most radical bolted?  He thought that the Republican Party needed to expand, and he was looking to those conservatives in the border states to build a national Republican Party based on Union.  Now, Lincoln eventually came to the Union party idea during the war, but before war he never saw the Republican Party expanding beyond its initial boundaries.  He did not come to this crisis as the president-elect of a country but as the leader of a party and a party that had always been in opposition.  But there was even a third factor.  Lincoln, I think, was more viscerally anti-slave than Seward.  Yet, he was no abolitionist; he even supported the original Thirteenth Amendment which would have made it practically impossible to touch slavery in the states.  As a constitutionalist, he couldn’t do otherwise because he believed the constitution sanctioned slavery in the states, but by emphasizing the territories and by saying never again in any territory he could get around that constitutional barricade and still hold to his constitutional scruples.  He saw the future in territories.  In his view stopping slavery in the territories stopped slavery in the future.  He also claimed that he was simply carrying out the legacy of the founding fathers.  In his famous Cooper Union address back in February 1860, he focused on the signers of the Constitution and he said that these men really intended for an antislavery America and somehow that legacy had been turned in the wrong direction.   But although Lincoln in the speech talked about what he called the facts, the founding fathers bequeathed a much more complicated legacy.  With every president from Washington to Monroe new territories permitting slavery were added to the Union or organized</p>

<b><i>CWBR</i>:</b> You mentioned Seward’s national recognition and leadership in the formation of the Republican Party, being one of the premier Whigs before that.  In those weeks after the election, did Seward want to appear as the savior of the Union for his own self-fulfilling purposes or did he simply not trust Lincoln to serve the country adequately?</p>
<p>
<p><b> (WJC):</b> I don’t think he knew enough about Lincoln to know what to think about Lincoln.  I think most Republicans were in that position except those who were very close to Lincoln in Illinois.  Lincoln had a fairly small circle, his circle of intimates was almost closed.  And Seward wasn’t the only Republican concerned about what Lincoln would do.  I think he did have concerns about Lincoln but I think Seward also, early on, decided that the Union was in great danger and something had to be done to pacify the South in terms of convincing southerners that the Republicans weren’t out to get them.  And that’s what he wanted to do, but as I said a few minutes back, he was never willing to cross Lincoln.  Lincoln had bested Seward for the nomination and had been elected.  You can understand Lincoln’s thinking: if I go along with Seward, it’s going to look like I’m Seward’s man, and it’s going to be Seward’s presidency rather than mine.  I’ve got to establish myself and put myself in the front.  And he did that; he certainly did that in December of 1860 when after Thurlow Weed, Seward’s political ally, went to Illinois hoping to get Lincoln’s agreement on things he and Seward wanted.  Weed failed.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR</i>:</b> James Buchanan has time and again faced severe criticism for his failure to prevent secession and his seemingly passive stance in the face of southern attacks on federal property.  But, I wonder, how tough was the task that he faced and might historians have judged too harshly what he did not do (hold the Deep South in the Union) while failing to commend him for halting the spread of secession and preventing open conflict?</p>
<p>
<p><b> (WJC):</b> Well I don’t think Buchanan could have done much to halt the spread of secession.  Yet, he did have a great deal to do with keeping the flag flying at Fort Sumter and Fort Pickens that gave Lincoln levers that Lincoln wouldn’t have had otherwise.  Tthere was enormous pressure on Buchanan to give up both of them, and he held his ground in both.  I think he deserves a good deal of credit in terms of maintaining a position that his successor could use if his successor chose to.  What Buchanan would have done if he had ever faced what Lincoln faced at Fort Sumter: Anderson’s saying he needed to come out, that he was running out of supplies.  I think he would have withdrawn Anderson under those circumstances because his agreement with Anderson was if Anderson asked for help he would send help, Anderson didn’t ask for help in early March of 1861.  He said he couldn’t be successfully reinforced.  In terms of stopping secession there was very little Buchanan could do.  You may say, well he should have done what Andrew Jackson did.  Well remember Andrew Jackson did two things.  One, he did raise the threat of the sword but he also worked with Congress to get a compromise to diffuse the situation.  Buchanan had no chance with Congress, the Republicans wouldn’t pay him any mind whatever.  He had even lost his influence with the southern Democrats over Fort Sumter.  So by January the first he was in Congress a dead letter practically speaking, with both Republicans and southern Democrats.  Then, he faced a much more difficult situation than Jackson did.  Jackson had one state where Buchanan had one state going out and several other states, all the way west to Texas saying we’re all going out if you do anything.  So he calculated that if he took any overt act that would encourage secession more than if he didn’t take any overt act.  Now perhaps taking an overt act would have slowed it down; we can’t know that but that was the calculation he made and in my mind to compare him and Jackson is really like comparing apples and oranges.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR</i>:</b> When Alabama Congressman, Williamson Cobb, left his post in Washington to return home, he writes the Republican Party: “you can still this storm before the sun shall set to-day.”  Is that correct, and how?</p>
<p>
<p><b> (WJC):</b> Well he said that in a speech in the House of Representatives.  If the Republicans would have agreed to a serious compromise, that would have killed secession.  I mean Cobb believed that; I certainly believe that; Jefferson Davis believed that, Robert Toombs (who didn’t want any compromise) believed that.  It’s hard to see, in a state like Georgia where the vote was so close anyway, that if serious compromise had been reached that Georgia would have gone out.  Even though South Carolina had gone out, Georgia was the bridge to the rest of the Deep South.  However, the same deal that started secession in Georgia would have done likewise farther west.  In sum, I think Cobb was right.</p>
<p>
<b><i>CWBR</i>:</b> You end your book, just as you begin it, with a look at John J. Crittenden, the political heir-apparent to Henry Clay.  While Clay became known as the Great Compromiser or Great Pacificator, Crittenden failed to hold the nation together.  Does this signal failure on Crittenden’s part or is he symbolic of the inability to compromise after Lincoln’s election?</p>
<p>
<p><b> (WJC):</b> I think that Crittenden did all that Crittenden could do.  He could not move Lincoln; he could not move the Republicans.  The Republican Party was not going to break with Lincoln.  He was the first elected Republican.  The Republicans had never had the White House before and they were going to stand united behind that man if they could.  And even Seward, who wanted to go toward Crittenden wasn’t going to break with Lincoln.  They were going to keep a united party.  It was not Crittenden’s fault as one hard-liner Republican said and I quote him: “we couldn’t stand firm until people like Clay and Webster were gone.”  Crittenden just couldn’t move the people he had to move. </p>

<p>
<p><b><i> Civil War Book Review (CWBR): </i></b> Today the Civil War Book Review is proud to speak with Gretchen Long, Associate Professor of History and Chair of the Africana Studies Program at Williams College, and discuss her recent book <i>Doctoring Freedom: The Politics of African American Medical Care in Slavery and Emancipation</i>.  Thank you for joining us today.</p>
<p>

<b>Gretchen Long (GL):</b> It's good to be here</p>
<p><b><i>CWBR: </i></b> So, healthcare and control over healthcare decisions were important steps towards freedom and independence for slaves? </p>
<p> 

<b>GL:</b> Yes that's right, before the war and during the war and after actually.  I had found when I started researching, or not even researching the book, but thinking about this topic, how often medical care came up as a kind of area of conversation between slaves and masters in terms of what kinds of medical care slaves would receive or master's displeasure with the kind of care slaves were giving each other and that just sort of got my wheels turning and I took it from there.</p> 
<p><b><i>CWBR: </i></b> How successful were slaves then at controlling their own bodies?</p>
<p>
<b>GL:</b> That's a really interesting question because it's something that sources hint at but we never get a complete and full answer.  But certainly, I think the level of frustration that slave owners had with and would report in journals or diaries or conversations with buyers or sellers of slaves, the level of frustration they had with slave medical practice, combined with the fact that many white families had black slaves look after them themselves.  That to me says there was quite a bit of medical care that the slaves managed to keep under their own purview and did not yield to white authority.</p>
<p><b><i>CWBR: </i></b>How did their roles as soldiers during the war, especially after injury, change the relationship between African-Americans and the government?</p>
<p>
<b>GL:</b> The thing about the Civil War is that particularly for slaves who fled toward the Union lines, but even ones that stayed behind, is that both systems of care were really offended.  Both care that the slaves communities provided for one another for fellow slaves and under the systems of white masters control or provision of medical care, both of those kind of have the rug pulled out from under them and in the Union Army so many slaves, slave men who joined the Union Army, showed up at recruiting stations in terrible health.  They had walked a long way they were malnourished.  Their families were in rough shape but they immediately, soldiers at least immediately, see medical care as part of the contract that they have with the Union Army.  That they are providing labor or military service and one of the things that they see the government needing to provide for them, and what the government does provide for white soldiers, is medical care.  So one of the most interesting things I found in terms of letters from black soldiers complaining to the government about the medical care they received because even though the soldiers felt that they were entitled to it, and did get some it, was often substandard and not at the level the white soldiers care was.</p>
<p><b><i>CWBR: </i></b>How did the problems of medicine and healthcare effect African-Americans in their transition from slaves to freedmen?</p>
<p>
<b>GL:</b> Yeah, I think particularly the ideal when you achieve freedom is when you own your own body.  Now how that body is taken care of and who takes care of it then becomes really essential to expressing that freedom, to any expression of that freedom, and giving that freedom meaning.  So, I have been really inspired by a lot of work that you are referring to that kind of puts the school house, or the church, or the polling place, or even sort of different realms of labor, that looks at those places as places where freedom happens, or where black people figured out how to be free in those places, and what I wanted to do is put the doctor’s office, the sick bed, and ultimately the medical school, on that list of places where black people gave their freedom meaning.</p>
<p><b><i>CWBR: </i></b>Why did organically developed black associations and brotherhoods work so much better to harness the efforts of the community rather than government directed efforts?</p>
<p>
<b>GL:</b> Yeah that's a really good question too.  I think in the associations, and like you said there’s a whole chapter in the book on this, for one thing the black associations I’m painting with kind of broad strokes here, but were better at identifying leaders, of knowing who should be in charge and how things should be organized.  Than when the Freedman’s Bureau came in and sort of ordained certain black men as the spokesmen for the group.  So, and of course, sometimes the black people were terrible at choosing leaders and I have some stories in there of leaders who swindled their associations out of money and this and that, but I think, for the most part, people, black people, knew certain men by reputation or kind of stature in their community, and those were ways of knowing that the white Freedman’s Bureau did not have access too so, and I think it was also a natural selection of the kind of community care that happened under slavery even though those slave communities were upended and disrupted with emancipation.</p>
<p><b><i>CWBR: </i></b> How did African-American attempts to become medical providers relate to the problems faced by the larger African-American community?</p>
<p>
<b>GL:</b> I think the one who gives us kind of where the window opens the widest on that period, is one of the doctors, John Hamilton, who lived in Austin, Texas, because he called himself a doctor and what he wants is for the Freedman’s Bureau to help him collect money from freedman that he says he’s treated, and the Freedman’s Bureau also to encourage freedman to go to him for their care instead of to the white doctors.  The Freedman’s Bureau has kind of set up their services and what happens is the Freedman’s Bureau says no way he’s a quack and a conjurer, and what's interesting to me is that a group of freedmen themselves write to the Freedman’s Bureau back in Washington and say yes indeed he is a quack and a conjurer.  So, his case really shows the diversity of opinion among freedmen and how impossible it can be to talk about a free community, or a freedman thought this, or that you know here was real division about who some freedman who thought he was a good doctor but refused to pay him and some thought he was a conjurer and a quack and should give up calling himself a doctor.  So I like that case because partially because it doesn’t really show an answer exactly but it does point to how  those letters happened in 1866 and the kind of the writing on the wall of what happens to folk healers like Hamilton.  They are not going to be able to make livings, or maintain respectability, in the eyes of white authority as we go forward in the decades.  You know his system of medicine is on the way out and the system of the whites Freedman’s Bureau, doctor’s practices, and that more and more black doctors, and I talk about them, want in on them.  They want for more medical training that is what's ascending, not just in the black South, but all over the country.</p>
<p><b><i>CWBR: </i></b>How did the professionalization of medicine by the turn of the century help or hinder the development, political activism, and solidarity of the greater African-American community?</p>
<p>
<b>GL:</b> I think that that last chapter in the book chronologically, the last couple of decades that the book, deals with the story, really shifts from a context of slavery and emancipation to a context of Jim Crow and segregation.  So even in scholarly literature we know that the waves of protests, and resistance, and solidarity, happened under those different kind of regimens, is very different by the end of the book.  There are very few, and by the turn of the century there are very few white medical schools that let in African Americans.  By 1910 most black medical schools have been shut down with increasing regulation, which did raise standards for medical education, but also cut off then  most of the avenues by which young black mostly men, could get medical training.  So when the book sort of ends right before World War I, we have a handful of black medical schools that are functioning, that are graduating black doctors, who want to become part of sort of this talented 10th class.  But, they are just a handful, and those doctors have a kind of political consciousness that I talk about.  That they manage to combine medical expertise in an almost urban sophistication with their political activism.  But it’s very different than the kind of challenges to white authority that we see from black soldiers, or from slaves, so the story really shifts when we start talking the kind of era of segregation, the ways in which black doctors and patients are able to mount any kind of protest is really shaped by the kind of larger American order. </p>
<p><b><i>CWBR: </i></b>So, in the end then, the role of health care in the black community paints a picture of the entire movement from slavery to freedom?</p>
<p>
<b>GL:</b> Yeah that's right and it plays and integral part in the development of the community in the midst of incredibly cynical suffering that a lot of black soldiers, and their families and freed people in contraband camps are really suffering during the war, and just after there the small pox epidemic, there’s a lot of poverty in cities, there’s a cholera epidemic in 1866, but through all this in advocating for the care they do get even though it is scant, and for advocating for medical education even though it is often substandard, they really seize on their rights and their kind of language that helps them present themselves as freed people. </p>
