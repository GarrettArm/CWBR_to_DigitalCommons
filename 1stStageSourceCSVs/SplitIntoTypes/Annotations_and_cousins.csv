In <b>Lincoln and the Abolition of Slavery</b>, Russell Roberts uses John Brown, the 1860 election, and the role of blacks in the War to explicate slavery's role in the festering regional hostilities. Diane Yancey sketches the lives of politicians, abolitionists, military commanders, and  prominent women in <b>Leaders of the North and South</b>.  Weapon technology, cavalry equipment, artillery, naval warfare, and espionage are featured in <b>Weapons of War</b> by Gail B. Stewart. Seven key battles or campaigns are discussed in Diane Yancey's <b>Strategic Battles</b>, along with ironclad engagements and postwar reunions. The common soldiers' perspective is depicted in James A. Corrick's <b>Life Among the Soldiers and Cavalry</b> through such experiences as enlistment, camp food, grooming, and mutiny. Although the books overlap in some places, they generally complement each other in subject matter. Each volume offers footnotes and interesting sidebars about topics such as the Whig party and General Meade's horse Old Baldy. Some include a glossary or a chronology. Overall, the series would enrich a middle school-level library or bookshelf.

In an effort to discourage Missouri from joining the ranks of the Confederacy, President Abraham Lincoln ordered a strong military presence to the Missouri-Kansas border region in the months prior to the Civil War.  Kansan soldiers supported by Union forces used the confiscation of private property, physical coercion, and martial law to frighten Missourians into submission.  These repeated incursions left Missourians with little choice but to retaliate.  In the years prior to and during the Civil War, they engaged in guerilla-like tactics against their aggressors and, in the process, were transformed from innocents into cold-blooded killers.

Fichtelberg argues just the opposite. Women, according to the author, are the ones adaptable to the travails of the market. Their sentiments, supposedly more virtuous and immune to temptation and vice than men, helped to endear the whimsical market onto the soul of the country.

The second group was made up of locals who were tired of playing second fiddle to Burns' accomplishments, and spoke out against him."" In death, as in life, John Burns's role as the oldest combatant at Gettysburg has been a site of contention. This book attempts to separate the facts from the legend."

2729	807854107	$19.95	Neither Lady nor Slave: Working Women of the Old South		Gillespie, Michelle	Delfino , Susanna		<h3>From the shadows of history</h3><br><h3>Work rediscovers toil of forgotten laborers</h3><p>One of the most exciting developments in the recent scholarship of antebellum Southern society has been the exploration of the lives of white, free black, and Native American working women, the subject of this outstanding collection of essays edited by Michele Gillespie and Susan Delfino. Michele Gillespie is associate professor of history at Wake Forest University. She is the author of <i>Free Labor in an Unfree World: White Artisans in Slaveholding Georgia, 1789-1860</i> (Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2000). Her co-editor, Susanna Delfino, professor of American history at the University of Genoa (Italy), is the author of numerous articles on antebellum Southern society and culture.</p><p>As the authors of <b>Neither Lady nor Slave</b> attest, Southern society was much more than a community of slaveholders and slaves. Indeed, as contributor Thomas Lockley points out, three-quarters of all white Southern families did not even own slaves. For decades, late twentieth-century historians painstakingly documented the working lives of plantation mistresses and female slaves while the worlds of yeoman women from the yeomanry and laboring classes remained virtually untouched.</p> <p>Of course, the experiences of ordinary working women were not totally neglected. Three ground-breaking works û Stephanie McCurry's <i>Masters of Small Worlds</i> (1995), an excerpt of which appears in <b>Neither Lady nor Slave</b>), Victoria Bynum's <i>Unruly Women: The Politics of Social and Sexual Control in the Old South</i> (1992), and Paul Escott's <i>Many Excellent People: Power and Privilege in North Carolina, 1850-1900</i> (1985) û exposed the working experiences and grim realities of yeoman and poor white women.</p><p>The international group of scholars contributing essays to this collection make the point that Southern women of the middling and lower classes were integral participants in the South's market economy. As the editors (and contributors) Michele Gillespie and Susanna Delfino argue in the introduction, white, free black, and Native American women in many regions of the South struggled, and in many cases, were able to exert control over the marketing of their work. Although their labor and work products were often not as visible or as easily traceable as men's, women's work was critical to the survival of their families and their communities.</p><p>The first group of essays examines rural women's interaction and impact on the market economy. James Taylor Carson illuminates the innovative ways that Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Creek women managed the marketing of their goods in the early nineteenth century while remaining true to their tribal culture. Similarly, Sarah H. Hill's essay on Cherokee women's basket weaving demonstrates the ways in which these women adapted their products to the demands of the marketplace without losing their cultural integrity. Stephanie McCurry's excerpt from <i>Masters of Small Worlds</i> makes the case that the productivity of yeoman farms depended on the labor of yeoman women. Though her work was often invisible, the farm wife's skills and stamina were crucial to the farm's prosperity. The yeoman woman's contributions not only affected productivity directly, such as through her field work and other farm labor, but also through the additional burden of her domestic tasks, which kept all family workers productive.</p><p>The working lives of urban wage-earning women are examined in the volume's second group of essays. In an investigation of children's governesses and nurses in the South's northernmost cities from Washington, D.C. to Louisville, Kentucky, Stephanie Cole probes the factors motivating their employers' shift from a reliance on slave women in the early nineteenth century to a preference for white middle-aged women by the 1840s and 1850s. In Thomas Lockley's comprehensive, thought-provoking article on working white and black women of antebellum Savannah, he underscores the restrictiveness of a strong bias in American women's history. He argues that the emphasis on the analysis of women's domestic lives has obscured the presence, importance, and significance of women's interactions in the public sphere. Lockley pays particular attention to race and gender issues as he documents the diversity of women's work in Savannah. In one discussion, he describes slave women's monopoly of vegetable-vending in the city market (a venue dominated by women), based on their ability to undersell the produce of white women. So desperate was one Irish immigrant female vendor to sell her wares that she blacked her face to attract customers. Barbara J. Howe's essay explores the diversity of women's wage work in western Virginia, focusing largely on women's employment within and relating to the textile industry û as mill workers, seamstresses, and dressmakers.</p><p>Prostitutes, teachers, and black and white Catholic nuns are the subjects of the third group of articles. E. Susan Barber unravels the history of prostitutes in Richmond from the 1850s to the 1870s, attending particularly to the increasing visibility of sex workers and to issues of race and class in the rapidly growing city. Emily Bingham and Penny Richards analyze the teaching lives of the three Mordecai sisters in early nineteenth-century Warrenton, North Carolina. The authors claim that many more women were teachers in the antebellum South than has been previously recognized, in large part due to the invisibility of women teachers operating schools in their own homes.</p> <p>Emily Clark's and Diane Batts Morrow's articles on Catholic nuns present the self-sufficient and financially independent lives these religious women led. Emily Clark's study of the white sisters of the New Orleans Ursuline order depicts the broad range of their economic activities in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. As slaveholders, the Ursulines supervised slave women in the operation of a commercial laundry. The sisters also rented property and invested in real estate, managed a dairy, and ran a school. Diane Batts Morrow uncovers the work of the Oblate Sisters of Baltimore, the first permanent sisterhood composed of women of African descent in the United States. The Oblate nuns kept themselves solvent by sewing, renting rooms, and operating a school for the black children of Baltimore, a fragile enterprise that required the support of African Americans in the community.</p> <p>Three essays focusing on the working lives of antebellum Southern industrial women conclude the collection. Bess Beatty discusses female textile workers' attitudes toward their work and their employers, noting the women's vocal disapproval and their acts of rebellion and protest against unsatisfactory working and living conditions. Michele Gillespie analyzes the relationships between young female textile mill operatives and factory owners and bosses in Georgia. She also explores how issues of race affected Georgian industrial management. As Gillespie maintains, mill owners preferred to hire the cheapest labor available. White women and children fit the bill best, costing the companies even less than male slaves. Susanna Delfino exposes the labor of white and black women in the iron and mining industries, a much-neglected subject in the history of working women in the South and the North. Although the intensity of the stigma attached to this type of work for women impeded the public's knowledge of it at the time and in decades since, white, slave, and free black women operated furnaces and forges; worked as machinists, mechanics, and nail carriers; and toiled at a multitude of tasks relating to the preparation of charcoal, which fired the furnaces and forges.</p><p><i>Judith E.

3796	9781589802537	$23.00 hardcover	General James G. Blunt: Tarnished Glory		Collins, Robert			<h3>Political General</h3><br><h3>The Rise and Fall of James G. Blunt</h3><p>James G. Blunt was one of the North's many political generals, but he was not typical of the breed.  While Blunt's ambitions may have outstripped his abilities, he was a fighter.  On more than one occasion, his courage, aggressiveness, and tenacity compensated for his deficiencies, and he ended up compiling a list of achievements that excelled the records of many of the Union Army's professionally trained commanders.  Blunt raised and led the armies that reestablished Union authority in much of Indian Territory and northwest Arkansas.  He defeated Rebel forces in pitched battles at Old Fort Wayne, Cane Hill, Prairie Grove, and Honey Springs.   He personally supervised the recapture of Fort Smith, Arkansas.  In the fall of 1864, he played a leading role in crushing Major General Sterling Price's great cavalry raid into Missouri and eastern Kansas.  </p><p>Blunt was born in Maine on July 21, 1826.  He graduated from medical school in 1849 and moved to Kansas Territory seven years later, where he emerged as a leading abolitionist and free stater.  By late 1857, Blunt had become an aide to James H. Lane, the flamboyant Jayhawker and rising politician who had been named major general of the free state militia.  With the outbreak of the Civil War, Blunt enlisted in the Union Army.  Lane, now a U.S. senator, had Blunt commissioned as the lieutenant colonel of the 3rd Kansas Volunteer Infantry Regiment in July 1861.  The following April, Lane secured his protΘgΘ an appointment as brigadier general and commander of the Department of Kansas.  Blunt remained true to his prewar principles, making public pronouncements in the summer of 1862 in favor of emancipation and raising black troops.  Once these measures became official Union policy, Blunt continued to give them his outspoken support.  </p><p>Senator Lane was a duplicitous schemer with rough-hewn manners, a fiery temper, and a ruthless resolve to run over anyone who stood in his way.  A man with such an abrasive character was bound to attract many enemies.  As the beneficiary of Lane's sponsorship, James Blunt also inherited the senator's enemies.  Even if Blunt had not been a loyal Lane man, his own personality would have made him the target of criticism.  The former doctor was a coarse man who did not mince his words.  He drank too much and exhibited a fondness for prostitutes.  His administration of various Western commands also inspired ugly rumors of corruption.  Several professional Union officers took a dislike to Blunt.  Despite the latter's many victories, Major General Henry Wager Halleck, the Union Army's chief of staff, dismissed him in April 1864 as a very quarrelsome man.  Brigadier General John M. Schofield, the commander of the Department of Missouri and Blunt's immediate superior in the middle part of the war, pushed for the obstreperous Kansan's relief on October 1, 1863, less than a month after the capture of Fort Smith.  Major General Samuel R. Curtis, who commanded Blunt at other times in the war, was one of the few West Pointers to appreciate the former doctor's military merits.</p><p><i>General James G. Blunt:  Tarnished Glory</i> by Robert Collins is the first book-length biography of the Union general that critics called the fat boy.  Considering Blunt's colorful personality and impressive military career, it is surprising that he had to wait so long for such a detailed treatment.  No doubt the fact that Blunt's exploits were confined to the Trans-Mississippi theater accounts for his neglect by Civil War scholars.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Collins book does not begin to do justice to its subject.  The author is a freelance writer from Kansas with a passionate interest in local history.  His previous books include <i>Kansas Railroad Attractions and Ghost Railroads of Kansas</i>.  The main problem with <i>General James Blunt</i> is that its author thought that he could research this topic without straying outside Kansas.  His bibliography cites only six document collections at the Kansas State Historical Society and an 1850 census record from a county historical society in Ohio.  Blunt's personal papers did not survive, but Collins could have tapped into the general's voluminous official correspondence had he visited the National Archives.  In addition, he neglected the opportunity to visit state and local archives throughout the United States to examine the letters, diaries, and unwritten memoirs of many of the men who either served under Blunt or fought against him.  Having opted to ignore the sort of sources that have enriched serious Civil War scholarship for decades, Collins relies largely on printed works, including period newspapers, which he does not always use judiciously.  Consequently, the book is riddled with frustrating gaps, idle speculation, and some errors of fact and interpretation.  The absence of reference notes also makes it difficult to know when Collins is performing competently.  </p><p><i>General James Blunt</i> is an interesting study, and Collins' portrait of the man is certainly plausible, but the book suffers from an amateurish quality that calls its reliability into question.</p><p><i>Gregory J. W. Urwin is a professor of history and associate director of the Center for the Study of Force and Diplomacy at Temple University.  He is also the editor of <b>Black Flag over Dixie:  Racial Atrocities and Reprisals in the Civil War</b>, which was recently released in paperback by Southern Illinois University Press.</i></p>		Fall 2007	2007-11-01	Annotation			Pelican Publishing Company					"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=234 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/GeneralJames.jpg"">"

2365	087338721X	$9.95	The Fourth Battle of Winchester: Toward a New Civil War Paradigm		McMurry, Richard M.			This analysis of the causes of southern defeat concludes with an assessment that fixes primary blame on military blunders in the West. Lee's role is viewed as overwhelmingly positive for the southern cause, giving the South a chance despite disaster in the West. Rather uniquely, the author uses counterfactual history in the first half of the study to illustrate its potential beneficial uses in analyzing the past.

Described by author Joseph Durkin as a man of heart, Stephen Mallory harbored a deep passion for his family, friends, and education.  In fact, Mallory's intellectual curiosity allowed him to move quickly through the ranks of the civil service to become Secretary of the Navy for the newly-formed Confederate States of American in February 1861.  He quickly recognized the Union's naval superiority and implemented a plan to cripple the North's vulnerable merchant marine.  Mallory sought to ensure the success of this strategy with the creation of the first ironclad vessel, the <i>Virginia</i>.  While the approach ultimately failed to secure victory for the South, Mallory's four years as Confederate Naval Chief did much to revolution naval science.
