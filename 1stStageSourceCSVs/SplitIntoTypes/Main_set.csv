2194	679433457		The Fabulous History of the Dismal Swamp Company: A Story of George Washington's Times		Royster, Charles			"<i>This review is also available under the following title:</i><br><i><a href=""http://www.cwbr.com/cgi-bin/dbman/cwbr/cwbr.cgi?db=cwbr&uid=default&sb1=11&so1=descend&sb2=3&so2=ascend&ma=on&fields1=Title&value1=nothing+like+it&view_records=1&bool=and&view_records.x=6&view_records.y=4&nh=2&mh=1"">Nothing Like It in the World</a></i><p>Make no small plans, ran British political wisdom, as they lack the power to move men's souls. Europeans in America took that advice to heart. From fountains of youth to cities of gold and continental fur trading empires, America stimulated gigantic dreams. Nothing seemed too large for ultimate accomplishment or too improbable for stupendous profit. These habits of thought, begun with exploration and discovery, continued into the 18th and 19th centuries, and are the common subject of two major works: Charles Royster's book on land speculation, <b>The Fabulous History of the Dismal Swamp Company</b>, and Stephen E. Ambrose's volume on the transcontinental railroad, <b>Nothing Like It in the World</b>. <p> The huge plans that both these books describe involved the exploitation of America's most valuable resource: land. The Dismal Swamp Company wished to drain the swamp, cut its trees, settle farmers on its soil, and dig a canal to connect the reclaimed lands to the Norfolk market. The Central Pacific and Union Pacific railroad companies planned to span the continent, open up the West to settlement, farming, timbering, and mining, and connect all America to the great markets in Chicago and New York. Both projects were undertaken with vastly inadequate capital and involved costs far beyond even pessimistic initial projections. <p> But the differences between the Dismal Swamp Company and the transcontinental railroad were more important than the similarities. The Dismal Swamp Company suffered from the use of slave labor, dated engineering technology, little of the governmental support vital to so large an undertaking, and management that was exceptionally inept and indolent. The transcontinental railroad benefited from substantial government help, had a free and disciplined labor force trained in teamwork by the recent war, enjoyed effective management, and utilized the latest steam-powered technology. Not surprisingly, the transcontinental railroad was completed in seven years, while the Dismal Swamp project lingered for years with little progress. <p> The Dismal Swamp Company was put together by a politically powerful coterie of interrelated Virginia aristocrats in 1763, though the concept had been around since a proposal from Colonel William Byrd in 1728. But the idea persisted, and on May 25, 1763, the Dismal Swamp Company presented a petition, with 151 signers, but only 12 partners, for a grant of the swamp. All of the partners were Virginia aristocrats or British merchants to whom the former owed money. George Washington was among the fortunate dozen. All assumed they would make a fortune. But things did not go well. The partners resisted sinking money or slave labor into logging, draining, fencing, and settling the swamp; they desired immediate profits. As the years passed with no effective or systematic exploitation, war and revolution disturbed Virginia, debt went unpaid, aristocratic families slid into bankruptcy, North Carolina poachers cut timber, and only during the administration of James Madison were any dividends paid. It was not an inspiring saga. <p> Royster has narrated this huge tapestry of domestic and public life across five generations of Virginians with affection and generosity, using the technique developed by Sir Lewis Namier in <i>The Structure of Politics at the Accession of George III</i> (Macmillan, 1929). Namier argued that English politics, confined to a smallish group of aristocrats, did not deal primarily with ideologies, ideals, or issues but instead revolved around the familial and social connections of the Members of Parliament along with their financial, business, and agricultural interests. Virginia politics was also the activity of aristocrats connected by marriage, by a similar interest in land and tobacco, by mutual investments in numerous land speculations in the West, and by vast debts owed here and abroad. They possessed the right connections to enjoy inclusion in land schemes, to carry debt for generations, to serve in public office, and to make advantageous marriages. Royster traces these connections, describing the marriages, births, deaths, bankruptcies, inheritances, offices, protested bills of exchange, and lawsuits. A huge cast populates the book, but two are central to this chronicle of well-connected cousins and in-laws: Mary Willing Byrd who died in 1814 and was related to virtually all of the Americans involved in the Dismal Swamp Company, and Samuel Gist, dead in 1815, a British merchant who held paper on virtually all of the Virginians involved in the Company. Debts, dreams, and generations, all written in the elegiac tones of a minor key. <p> Move ahead two generations from Federal Virginia to the Civil War, which created modern America out of blood and freedom and industry and technology. In the decade or so between the Mexican War and what my grandmother called the <i>recent</i> unpleasantness, a transcontinental railroad became an increasingly imperative national necessity. But, while the discovery of gold in California drove the project on, the politics of slavery held it up. The impossibly vexed issue was location. Ought the road to run through slave states or through free states? The Civil War simplified this issue, as it did so many in mid-century American politics. The route explored by Major General Grenville Dodge and supported by Abraham Lincoln prevailed, and the eastern terminus of the Union Pacific would be Omaha, Nebraska. From the west, the Central Pacific began in Sacramento and crossed the Sierra Nevada range along a route pioneered by Theodore Judah. They would meet somewhere, sometime, somehow. <p> Problems of government legislation and raising private capital became the constant nagging worry of the railroad builders. In the west, the Central Pacific partners, California's ""Big Four"" of Leland Stanford, Charles Crocker, Collis P. Huntington, and Mark Hopkins, raised enough in promises, paper, and cash to spike the first rail on October 23, 1863. The Union Pacific, dominated by Thomas Durant and run by Grenville Dodge, had sufficient difficulties with money, rails, ties, engines, and stock (both rolling and paper) that it laid no track until July 1865. <p> Once started, the Union Pacific pushed west along Dodge's route, spurred by the need to collect as much in government subsidies as possible. Corruptly managed by Durant, the road was a continuing miracle of technology, efficient engineering, and skilled labor. Trained to teamwork and industrial organization by the war, the free labor functioned superbly, if profanely. The work continued relentlessly, despite frequent wrecks that always produced casualties, in one of which ""several ladies were badly mangled."" Where towns were set up, temporary camps (cheerfully called ""Hell on Wheels"") appeared, containing taverns, gambling dens, and brothels. Immensely hard work required occasional blow-outs. The Central Pacific, whose labor was largely Chinese, had different problems. One was food, which had to be Chinese, and a second was the mountains. But the workers cut tunnels through granite by hand, worked and lived in snow tunnels 10 feet deep, and slowly built the road over the mountains. In 1868 they broke through and began the push across Nevada to the east, toward the Union Pacific racing west. <p> On May 8, 1869, the two roads were joined at Promontory Point, Utah, in a celebration announced by telegraph to the entire country. In Salt Lake City, one John Taylor spoke about having been on the first railroad ever built, between Manchester and Liverpool. In one single lifetime . . .  <p> Ambrose tells this tale of railroad building in terms of work, organization, discipline, and engineering, rather than the usual narrative of corruption, stock-jobbing, and influence peddling. He is interested in the terrain, the workers, and the engineers, and treats the transcontinental railroad as an heroic enterprise. He takes his tone from Vergil: ""So hard and huge a task it was"" to span the continent and bring together the new America. The railroads in the 19th century combined much of the best and the worst of America, and Ambrose concentrates on the best. Those looking to this powerfully written book for a standard screed against the robber barons will be disappointed; this book describes what makes America both an industrial and democratic success. <p> An English visitor to America, Charles William Janson, toured Virginia and the Dismal Swamp, and reported that ""speculation"" was ""the life of the Americans."" Attitudes had changed little between his visit in the 1790s and the 1860s, but America by then had acquired the capacity to translate huge dreams into technology and infrastructure, and entrepreneurs became rich while enriching the whole society. Royster and Ambrose describe these two eras in the American adventure, from when things could be dreamt but not done, to when the only limit was the dream itself. <p> <i>James D.

1847	1572491787		Sea Hawk of the Confederacy: Lt. Charles W. Read and the Confederate Navy		Campbell, R. Thomas			"<i>This review is also available under the following title:</i><br><i><a href=""http://www.cwbr.com/cgi-bin/dbman/cwbr/cwbr.cgi?db=cwbr&uid=default&bool=and&keyword=&ISBN=&Title=confederate+corsair&Auth_1=&Publisher=&Reviewer=&Issue_date=&Record_type=---&sb1=---&so1=ascend&view_records=View+Records&nh=1&mh=1"">Confederate Corsair: The Life of Charles W. Savez Read</a></i><p>In a recent issue of this journal a reviewer rightly observed, ""Biographies of Civil War-era naval officers are a scarce commodity and those of Southern officers are even more rare."" That is why the publication of <b>Sea Hawk of the Confederacy</b> and <b>Confederate Corsair</b> is worthy of note. The fact that they are about the same naval officer, and a junior officer at that, makes the event even more interesting and rare. Charles Read is unquestionably one junior officer who rates a biography. <p> Read's Civil War career is so fascinating that it reads like a novel. It certainly is the kind of story that should attract some movie producer. Although the books' titles, ""Sea Hawk"" and ""Corsair,"" suggest that Read was a pirate (another earlier biographer, Bob Weems, called him a ""Buccaneer""), in reality he was a naval officer whose activities were well within the bounds of legitimate warfare, namely the destruction of an enemy's sea-going commerce. A good bit of his brief career had nothing to do with the destruction of the Union's oceanic commerce, but riverine operations (both on land and water) defending the Confederacy. <p> His early life gave no indication of the most capable naval officer that he would become. He was born in 1840 in Yazoo County, Mississippi. Nine years later his father departed for the California gold fields where he subsequently died, leaving a 10-year-old Read virtually on his own. Jones writes that Read was ""impulsive,"" and his shifting career interests seem to support this characterization. At first attracted to journalism, he became bored with it and took up acting. He portrayed a sailor in a play before running away from home, intending to really ship before the masts on a sailing vessel out of New Orleans. <p> Young Read clearly was interested in a nautical career, which led his mother to seek successfully congressional assistance to get her son admitted to the United States Naval Academy. He was one of 52 who made up the class of 1860, of whom only 25 would graduate. His academic career at the Academy, however, was mediocre at best, ranking last in his class. Last he was, but there were classmates who even then recognized his potential. George Dewey and Winfield Scott Schley, both of whom served in the Union navy during the Civil War and became heroes in the Spanish-American War, were well acquainted with Read at the Academy. Admiral Schley later wrote that Read's class ranking ""was in no sense the measure of his intellectual worth, but arose from his lack of application to study. He possessed in high degree common sense - or ought I to say uncommon sense, as everyone does not possess it - that underlies success in every calling. . . . He had sublime courage, he had conspicuous dash, he had great originality, and was aggressive in all that he did."" <p> His career in the United States Navy was short-lived. When Mississippi seceded, he resigned his commission. At that time he was attached to the steam frigate <i>Powhatan</i> deployed off the coast of Mexico. He waited until the frigate returned to New York in the middle of March before departing for the South. The Confederate Navy Department ordered him to the <i>McR'</i>, then fitting out as a warship in New Orleans. It was on the <i>McR'</i> that he first acquired his reputation as a cool but aggressive officer. The <i>McR'</i> was involved in a number of engagements from the Head of the Passes at the mouth of the Mississippi River to New Madrid, Missouri. <p>  But it was the Battle of New Orleans in April 1862, when Flag Officer David Farragut bypassed the forts guarding the city, that Read first distinguished himself. As executive officer, and later commanding officer when his captain was mortally wounded, Read fought Farragut's fleet until the <i>McR'</i> was disabled. He then joined the crew of the ironclad ram <i>Arkansas</i>, fitting out at Yazoo City, Mississippi. In charge of the ship's stern battery, he participated in various actions as the ironclad fought powerful Union naval forces on her way down the Yazoo. Once on the Mississippi, the <i>Arkansas</i> moored at Vicksburg and near Baton Rouge, where she eventually had to be destroyed because of engine failure. <p> Read then spent several weeks directing a battery of heavy guns at Port Hudson on the Mississippi before being assigned to the Confederate raider <i>Florida</i>, which at that time was in Mobile. Serving as a lieutenant and boarding officer he persuaded the ship's captain, John Maffitt, to allow him to convert and command one of the prizes, the Union brig <i>Clarence</i>, into a raider. This inaugurated the exploit that made Read famous or infamous depending on one's allegiance. Sailing up the Atlantic seaboard to Maine, Read and his handpicked crew successfully captured and armed the <i>Tacony, Archer</i>, and revenue cutter <i>Caleb Cushing</i>. All told, he seized 16 vessels before finally being captured himself. Incarcerated at Fort Warren, Massachusetts, he was paroled and exchanged in October 1864. <p> Assigned next to the James River Squadron, he directed a river battery and commanded the squadron's torpedo boats. In February 1865, Confederate Secretary of the Navy Stephen Mallory assigned him to command the side-wheeler <i>William H. Webb</i>, then at Shreveport, Louisiana. Read's audacious and desperate plan was to run the gauntlet of Federal ships and sortie into the Gulf of Mexico where the <i>William H. Webb</i> would become another one of the cruisers. By the time that he reached Shreveport and readied the ship, the War was virtually over. Nevertheless, he headed downstream and was able to pass New Orleans before his way was blocked, forcing him to destroy his vessel. Read would live until 1890, working an assortment of maritime jobs, his last being a New Orleans pilot. <p> The biographies by R. Thomas Campbell and Robert A. Jones describe in graphic detail Read's extraordinary naval career. Readers of these two lively and readable books will find plenty of naval action and adventure. They should certainly appeal to the general reader. With the exception of some details of Read's life, however, there is really nothing new revealed in the books. Both authors depend heavily upon published secondary and primary works for their information, although Jones cites considerably more primary sources than does Campbell, including unpublished documents from the Naval Archives. <p> Reviewing biographies of the same individual simultaneously leads to some interesting discoveries. The contents at times can be surprisingly different. For example, Campbell briefly discusses the Naval Academy's curriculum at the time Read was there, while Jones describes a typical daily schedule. Both authors in their notes and bibliographies include information and evidently manuscripts about Read obtained from his descendants, but with one exception they come from different descendants. Both volumes are heavily illustrated - Jones with 32 and Campbell nearly a hundred - but again, with a few exceptions, they used different sketches and photographs. <p> Jones's bibliography is far longer and does indicate that his research was more extensive. <p> This reviewer has some minor concerns about unsubstantiated statements, erroneous information, and some inadequate notes that are found in both books. There are a few publications not cited by either author that would have been helpful, particularly Richard Winslow III's <A HREF=""http://www.civilwarbookreview.com/ncom/cwbr?pid=0915819201&id=<%$id%>"" ><i>'Constructing Munitions of War': The Portsmouth Navy Yard Confronts the Confederacy, 1861-1865</i></a> and Katherine Brash Jeter's <A HREF=""http://www.civilwarbookreview.com/ncom/cwbr?pid=7055009390&id=<%$id%>"" ><i>A Man and His Boat: The Civil War Career and Correspondence of Lieutenant Jonathan H.

First published by Oxford University Press in 1996, its reissue this year by the University of Georgia Press in softcover is a noteworthy event. It marks the emergence of an American social historian of major importance. <p> William Dusinberre did his graduate work in history at Columbia University. Subsequently, when the University of Warwick was founded in England in 1965, he took a job there and met Edward P. Thompson, the famous British social historian. Thompson's influence in shifting Dusinberre's attention to social history was a decisive one. <p> <b>Them Dark Days</b> focuses upon the rise and fall of the Rice Kingdom in South Carolina and Georgia from 1790 to 1865. Rice production in South Carolina expanded rapidly in the middle of the 18th century when production moved into the swamplands in and around the tidal rivers. Slaves were imported from West Africa, and American agricultural innovators adapted Dutch polderland (swampland) technology. To conquer the swamps and bring them under cultivation took as much human effort as was needed to build an Egyptian pyramid. Dikes were thrown up by gangs of slaves armed with spades, floodgates were installed, and conduits laid down to channel water to the fields. The swamplands were crisscrossed with irrigation ditches that could be filled with fresh (as opposed to salt) water when the tide was high. This water would be released back into the river days or weeks later, when the tide was out. <p> By 1860, rice production in the Georgia and South Carolina polderlands had grown into a highly profitable business concentrated in the hands of a tiny group of wealthy planters. These men were agricultural capitalists driven by a passion for profit. Twenty-four families, with 300 or more slaves each, together owned one-half of the 48,000 slaves who toiled on the rice plantations. The big rice planters, Dusinberre points out, were also rulers of the South. They championed secession and war as the best way to protect their vast investment in ricelands and slaves. <p> Dusinberre centers his attention on three of the biggest Lowcountry rice plantations: Charles and Louis Manigault's Gowrie, a Georgia plantation eight miles upstream from Savannah; Robert Allston's Chicora Wood plantation in the Waccamaw-Pee Dee peninsula area; and Pierce Butler's Butler Island, a diked swamp in the Altamaha River, ten miles upstream from the Atlantic beaches. <p> Fortunes were amassed from rice at a high cost in human life. On all three plantations, the child mortality rate was as high as 90 percent for children up to age 16. Mothers, having undergone many confinements and miscarriages, often ended up with no more than one or two children who survived past adolescence. Adult slaves in the prime of life died of sunstroke, exhaustion, malarial fevers, tuberculosis, and pneumonia. Slave marriages were destroyed constantly by the death or deportation of one of the partners. <p> The black captives were driven to daily labor by the lash. They resisted their tormentors in various ways, but rarely resorted to open violence against them: the military balance of power, as Dusinberre points out, was overwhelmingly against them. They lamed animals, ""bogged mules,"" broke ploughs, untied the tethers of boats, and botched repairs. Above all, they sought relief by fleeing, at least for a short while, to surrounding swamps, islands, and woodlands. ""The slaves,"" as Dusinberre sums up on page 201, ""were locked into a class conflict of epic proportions, pitting a largely homogeneous class of slaves against profit-seeking masters. . . .""  <p> Where Gowry and Chicora Wood are concerned, the Manigault and Allston papers provide the core evidence on which Dusinberre bases his story. Frances Anne Kemble's <i>Journal of a Residence on a Georgian Plantation in 1838-1839</i> provides the evidence for Butler Island and Butler Point on St. Simons Island. Kemble, a celebrated stage actress turned wife of Pierce Butler, Jr., and mistress of the Butler plantations, compiled a record of the slavery experience as voiced primarily, though not exclusively, by black slave women. In devoting one whole section of his book to Kemble's record, Dusinberre writes, ""I have sought to listen carefully to the testimony of black witnesses."" He sets Kemble's <i>Journal of a Residence</i> into the wider context of the Rice Kingdom as a whole. This is a contribution that serves both to highlight the significance of that record and also to substantiate it. <p>  Catherine Clinton, author of  <i>The Plantation Mistress: Woman's World in the Old South</i>, and visiting professor of history at Baruch College, now comes with two books on Kemble. The first of these, <b>Fanny Kemble's Civil Wars</b>, focuses primarily on Kemble's unhappy domestic life. Clinton devotes barely one-third of a chapter, or 200 lines in a book of 268 pages, to Kemble's Georgia experience and to the creation of her <i>Journal of a Residence</i>. She has little to say about the <i>Journal of a Residence</i> itself, limiting herself to the remark, on page 178, that it is ""a haunting diatribe against human bondage."" A diatribe, according to my dictionary, is ""a piece of wearisome denunciatory rhetoric."" <p> This study does underline a point which, to be sure, others have made before Clinton. Frances Kemble arraigned American slave masters for high crimes against humanity. For this she paid a heavy price: a shattered marriage, a long separation from her children, and ultimately a permanent estrangement from her younger daughter, Frances Butler Leigh. <p> It would seem that Clinton was not entirely satisfied with <b>Fanny Kemble's Civil Wars</b>. Was it not weakened by its failure to explore Kemble's literary heritage, and in particular to examine and evaluate the <i>Journal of a Residence</i>? And what about Kemble's service in bringing African-American women to the forefront of our history: does that not deserve recognition? <p> To answer such questions, Clinton offers a second book, entitled <b>Fanny Kemble's Journals</b>, presenting a chronological narrative of Kemble's life in her own words. Here the <i>Journal of a Residence</i> is given pride of place. Selections from the <i>Journal of a Residence</i> take up no less than one-third of the entire book. The balance of the work is filled out by selections from the travel journal that Kemble published in 1835, and by letters from Kemble's voluminous published correspondence. <p> It is regrettable that <b>Fanny Kemble's Journals</b> has few maps and illustrations. It would have been strengthened in particular by drawing more exhaustively on the work of Alice Ravenel Huger Smith. Smith, daughter and granddaughter of rice planters and outstanding American watercolorist, created during the 1920s a number of marvelous paintings of the old Rice Kingdom. But, leaving aside the shortcomings of book design, <b>Fanny Kemble's Journals</b> is a useful introduction to the story of Kemble's life in the United States, especially during the period 1832 to 1865. <p> Although the two books have been published simultaneously, <b>Fanny Kemble's Journals</b> supplants rather than supplements <b>Fanny Kemble's Civil Wars</b>. The <i>Journal of a Residence</i> is no longer a ""haunting diatribe"" but a ""searing indictment of slavery"" and Kemble's ""most enduring literary contribution."" It is rendered more powerful, Clinton points out, because it ""is interlaced with [Kemble's] own struggle over her marriage, her future, and her children."" These are wise words. The struggle against slavery was central to Kemble's life; this was the moral force that created a chasm between Kemble and her husband and resulted in the disintegration of her family. <p> <i>John Anthony Scott is the editor of the definitive modern edition of Frances Anne Kemble's</i> Journal of a Residence on a Georgian Plantation in 1838-1839 <i>(1961, reissued 1984) and author of</i> Fanny Kemble's America <i>(1973).</i>"	Scott, John Anthony	Winter 2001	2000-12-01	Review	Actress turned plantation mistress decried horrors of slavery	Command performance	University of Georgia Press	2000-04-01				"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=249 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/DusinberreThemDarkDays.jpg"">"

How shall I address you?"" asked a well-wisher shortly after American voters elected William McKinley. ""Call me Major,"" McKinley replied. ""I earned that. I am not so sure of the rest."" William H. Armstrong, an Ohioan and the author of <b>Major McKinley</b>, traces the life of McKinley from his enlistment as a private in the 23rd Ohio to his rise to major by war's end, and contends that the War defined the future president. <p> McKinley enlisted in the 23rd Ohio in 1861, where he experienced ""life among the mules"" while working in the commissary. His most famous moment in that capacity -  one memorialized in bronze - came at Antietam, when he ran food and coffee through a gauntlet of fire to his hungry regiment. Shortly thereafter, due to valor, talent, and the patronage of Rutherford B. Hayes, McKinley received an officer's commission, and served as a staff officer through the remainder of the War. McKinley's service was honorable but not dramatic, and his political opponents would later attack him for serving in the rear echelon of the Union army. <b>Major McKinley</b> illustrates a part of army life often neglected in Civil War books: the daily routine of those engaged in staff and logistical duties. <p>  Armstrong achieves two broad goals in the book: he does an excellent job describing the military life of William McKinley and he makes the case that this military service influenced McKinley's later political career. He accomplishes the first through a narrative account of McKinley's military stint. Then he relates how McKinley drew from his military experience during the political endeavors that followed. <p> The War gave McKinley a strong sense that former slaves should have legal rights and the vote, something the author fears McKinley betrayed when, as president, he preferred reconciliation with the former Confederate states to advocacy of rights for black Americans. Nevertheless, Armstrong's enthusiasm for his subject helps to carry <b>Major McKinley</b> through sections where the story is thin. <p> Though not a highly dramatic tale, <b>Major McKinley</b> thoroughly illuminates the life of the junior staff officer in the Civil War and the early life of a United States president. <p> <i>Mitchell McNaylor is a writer living in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.</i>"	McNaylor, Mitchell	Summer 2000	2000-06-01	Review	Civil War service influenced a future president's political views	Valor, talent, and patronage	Kent State University Press	2000-05-01				"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=249 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/WilliamArmstrongMajorMcKinley.jpg"">"						
1481	876111770		William Pitt Ballinger: Texas Lawyer, Southern Statesman, 1825-1888		Moretta, John			"A brilliant attorney and political insider, William Pitt Ballinger was one of the most powerful men in Texas during the mid-19th century. He lived and worked in Galveston, a booming city and one of the South's most prominent commercial ports. Prior to the Civil War, Ballinger practiced law with great success and served for several years as U.S. District Attorney. Most of all, he was a passionate unionist. Indeed, he was passionate in all his endeavors, as is reflected in John Anthony Moretta's excellent new biography, <b>William Pitt Ballinger</b>. <p> Moretta's superb description of Ballinger's painful transition from fervent unionism to equally strong pro-Confederate convictions is at the heart of the book. The major crisis in Ballinger's life came with the dissolution of the Union. A conservative Whig, he was determined to remain above the fray as the secession movement unfolded. However, he quickly became horrified at the prospect of disunion and battled to prevent it, making public speeches and issuing proclamations urging Texans to exercise moderation and restraint. <p> The secession of Texas in early 1861 devastated Ballinger. Yet he gradually accepted the people's decision to abandon the Union, and soon began to see the Confederate States of America as a perfectly legitimate replacement for the United States of America. Like so many unionists, as a slaveholder and racial paternalist, Ballinger had believed that slavery was safer under the strong, stable protection of the Union, and now the Confederacy took on that crucial role of authority. But there was more to Ballinger's becoming a complete Confederate. <p> For historians of the Civil War, one of the most difficult phenomena to understand, much less explain, is the willingness of countless professed unionists like Ballinger to shirk the Union and embrace the Confederacy so ardently. In his transformation into a diehard Confederate patriot, Ballinger typified the emotional, intellectual, and political journeys of these reluctant secessionists and their evolving ability to see the Confederacy as a cause that actually allowed them to imitate their former unionist principles. While slavery was nearly always at the root of their decisions, their stated arguments were complex, sophisticated, and rational, reflecting a full-blown sense of southern nationalism as well as a deep-seated determination to protect slavery. <p> Whatever historians might think about the legitimacy or illegitimacy of the Confederacy, they must take into account the increasingly obvious fact, argued by Gary Gallagher and other scholars, that Confederate nationalism was deeply felt and strongly maintained by a huge number of white Southerners throughout the war and for many decades afterward. The propaganda issued by southern nationalists proved pervasive and overwhelmingly convincing, even to southern unionists. William Pitt Ballinger grasped and absorbed the major intellectual and practical justifications for nationhood that were invoked by Confederates in 1861. He compared secession to the American Revolution, arguing that Texans simply acted upon ""the same right of Revolution our Forefathers believed incumbent upon them in order to free themselves from a tyrannical Government. We are doing no less than that at this moment in history."" <p> Ballinger rejected the notion that secession was a triumph of localism over nationalism. Like so many other former unionists, he viewed the Confederacy as the very best hope for preserving and promoting American democracy in a truly national context. Moretta asserts, ""In short, Ballinger shared the hope of many Texas unionists that the Confederacy would be all the things the old Union was, and more. The new nation would protect individual liberties, guarantee law and stability, propagate the original American mission, and do so in harmony with slavery."" Echoing another strain of southern propaganda, Ballinger viewed Abraham Lincoln's apparent threat to preserve the Union by force as ""repugnant to the spirit of free government,"" notes Moretta. ""He considered [Lincoln's] use of coercion more odious than secession itself."" <p> Serving as Confederate receiver for the port of Galveston during the war, Ballinger was a special commissioner to negotiate the surrender of Texas to Federal forces in 1865. As a devoted Confederate, he exulted in Lincoln's assassination and even advocated taking up arms again. Once the reality of final defeat took hold, Ballinger mourned for a time, but then picked up where he had left off before the war, practicing law and working his way back to prominence and prosperity by arguing cases on behalf of wealthy and influential clients-Northerners and Southerners alike. He declined appointments to both the Texas Supreme Court and the United States Supreme Court, preferring instead to remain ""a simple lawyer."" Yet there was nothing simple about this remarkable figure. <p> Based largely on the voluminous Ballinger Papers in the Center for American History at the University of Texas at Austin, <b>William Pitt Ballinger</b> will surely receive many accolades from the Texas history community, and it deserves equally high praise from southern historians as well. If there is doubt in anyone's mind that white Texans were as ""southern"" in their values and material interests as their fellow secessionists in the other Confederate states, this book gives potent proof to that argument. If anyone epitomized the long-enduring Texas (and southern)""establishment,"" William Pitt Ballinger was that person. Now he has a biography worthy of his stature. <p>   <i>T.

1851	684869977		The Monitor Chronicles: One Sailor's Account		Mariners' Museum	Davis, William C.	Geer, George S.	"<b>The <i>Monitor</i> Chronicles</b> does not examine the life of ""common"" sailors, a prominent genre in Civil War literature. Instead, the Mariner's Museum in Newport News, Virginia, enlisted William Marvel to edit and place in historical context the letters of George S. Geer, a member of the ironclad's crew. The resulting book details the life of one man who stood apart from the rest of the crew and represented the new breed of sailor needed to operate modern warships. <p> Geer joined the navy not for ideological reasons but to learn a trade and support his family. At the time of Geer's enlistment, the navy was desperately short of men. Recruiters promised potential sailors more than the government could provide, thus enticing men to sign up. Geer was one of the many men suckered into sea service by this ploy. <p> Soon after he entered the navy, Geer volunteered for duty aboard the U.S.S. <i>Monitor</i>. Because of time spent working in his father's stove foundry, Geer was taken on as a first-class fireman. Three weeks after he enlisted in 1862, Geer took part in the famous contest  between the <i>Monitor</i> and the Confederate ironclad C.S.S. <i>Virginia</i>. Geer wrote little about this contest and therefore Marvel briefly summarizes the clash in the first chapter. <p> After the duel, the <i>Monitor</i> mostly rode her anchor on Virginia's James River. The ship protected General George McClellan's lines of communication and potential evacuation route between the Peninsula and Washington, D.C., from the <i>Virginia</i> and her smaller sister ship, the <i>Richmond</i>. With the exception of an artillery duel with batteries atop Drewry's Bluff and the shelling of a plantation or two, the <i>Monitor</i>'s guns remained silent. Geer wrote to his wife twice a week, offering a window into his life aboard the vessel. <p> Like many Civil War sailors, Geer was a ""landlubber"" before enlisting, but in other respects he stood out from the rest of the crew. He was a member of the secret society of Masons, and the resulting ties possibly assisted him in receiving a promotion to yeoman. Geer also personally associated with some of the <i>Monitor's</i> officers, a most uncommon occurrence for enlisted sailors. Geer had his own cabin and his sole responsibility aboard the <i>Monitor</i> was to hand out tools as they were needed - quite a comfortable job. He was xenophobic and more at ease alone than among the many Irish and English immigrants in the <i>Monitor's</i> enlisted crew. Geer also aspired to an engineer commission, an appointment that he received shortly after the <i>Monitor</i> sank. For all these reasons, <b>The <i>Monitor</i> Chronicles</b> highlights one unique man's experiences that were far from typical of crewmen. <p> The Civil War prompted revolutionary advances in naval design. Wind permanently gave way to steam propulsion, and ship designs reflected this fundamental change. The <i>Monitor</i> broke with many naval traditions. Its crew berth was in the aft portion of the vessel with the captain's quarters forward. This configuration was opposite to naval norms and represents one of many examples of how the launching of the ironclad upended established naval practices. The navy needed technically-trained and -minded men like Geer to keep such modern ships in fighting trim. Custom-bound, the navy loathed the idea of parity between deck officers and engineers, but was forced to acknowledge that innovative systems and weapons called for a new breed of sailor. Although Marvel discusses technological developments, he could have done more to establish Geer's participation in this transformation in naval warfare while aboard the <i>Monitor</i>. <p>  As the main repository of <i>Monitor</i> artifacts, the Mariner's Museum is instrumental in salvaging the <i>Monitor's</i> innovative engine and turret, a preservation effort detailed in the last chapter. Drawings and color photos allow the reader to see the ship as she looks today, while also documenting the <i>Monitor's</i> rapidly deteriorating condition. <p> Marvel successfully conveys what life was like for Geer aboard the <i>Monitor</i>. However, he has a penchant for repetition that is seen in his use of identical quotations multiple times to make the same point. For people already knowledgeable about the <i>Monitor's</i> story, this book may not have much to offer. However, for those beginning to read on the <i>Monitor</i> or who want to learn what life was like on this fabled vessel, <b>The <i>Monitor</i> Chronicles</b> is worth a look. <p> <i>E.

1523			INTERVIEW:<p>'Unrelenting suspense': An interview with John Jakes, chronicler of the American epic		Theriot, Katie L.			"<b><i>Civil War Book Review (cwbr): You have achieved prominence as a writer of historical fiction. Do you see your role as primarily literary or historical -- or both?</i></b><p><b>John Jakes (jj)</b>: From the time I made my first sale (a 1500-word short story in 1950), writing an entertaining narrative was my chief goal. It was, that is, until the 1970s, when I began to research and write the first of The Kent Family Chronicles. At that point something new intruded: before starting to write the first volume, <i>The Bastard</i> (Jove, ISBN 0515099279, $7.99 softcover), I decided to think of the novels as perhaps the only books about a given period that someone might read. <p>The history therefore had to be as correct as conscientious research could make it without devoting a lifetime to it. I have followed that path ever since, with two goals for every novel: the entertaining story and the accurate history. Readers have come to appreciate and expect that duality, and indeed some have said that people have probably learned more history from me than from all the teachers, texts, and scholarly tomes in existence. If even fractionally true, it's flattering, and I'm well rewarded.<p><i><b>cwbr: The North and South Trilogy is your most renowned work. Would you say the novel or the television miniseries had the greater impact on the public's historical consciousness?</b></i><p><b>jj</b>: In terms of international recognition of both the title and the author, North and South the Miniseries (actually three of them) had the greatest impact, though this was mostly due to the popularity of the stars, notably Patrick Swayze, who is still talked about in connection with the shows. The history in the films was downplayed, so I suppose as far as the public's ""historical consciousness"" is concerned, perhaps the books had the greater impact, though I really have no way to judge.<p><i><b>cwbr: Is it ironic that novelists rather than historians often have spawned renewed public interest in the Civil War? Another example would be Ken Burns's famous PBS series, which introduced the conflict to a new generation of Americans?</b></i><p><b>jj</b>: Yes, it's ironic that popular culture often plays a major part in stimulating public awareness of history. There is an obvious reason. Great masses of people will never, ever read scholarly works, no matter how finely written; may not even know they exist. That's where I come in.<p><i><b>cwbr: Your website [www.johnjakes.com] mentions that you are an admirer of Charles Dickens. Has Dickens's work or style influenced your own writing? Have there been other inspirations?</b></i><p><b>jj</b>: I think Dickens influenced my writing in the sense that he was such a marvelous delineator of character, creating unforgettable people, and he combined this with a strong sense of social justice. Stylistically he was a genius, but very much of his own period; I couldn't write a novel in a similar way even if I had the talent, which I don't. One respect in which my work mirrors Dickens is that I have very strong beliefs about issues I've written about, notably slavery and its consequences.<p>Major influences on my historical novels are all of those in the genre that I read when I was growing up: Dumas in particular, Scott less so (hard going for me), and some of the great, all but forgotten historical novelists of the 1930s and '40s: Kenneth Roberts, Hervey Allen, Thomas Costain, Samuel Shellabarger. Great storytellers all. <p><i><b>cwbr: In your novels, you use a mixture of fictional and real characters. Are the fictional characters purely fictional or are they partial composites of historical figures combined with fictional elements?</b></i><p><b>jj</b>: My fictional characters are always that, fictional, though often based in part on real people (seldom famous) encountered during my research. You could say my fictional characters are representative of certain types of people living and working at the time of the particular story. Orry Main in The North and South Trilogy, for instance, is based on no single individual, but very much resembles well-off Carolina rice planters of the period. <p><i><b>cwbr: One reviewer described North and South as a ""feat of research."" How is the research for your novels conducted?</b></i><p><b>jj</b>: Full-time research generally accounts for about one-half of the time track for a novel. I begin with very general secondary works about the period, to get a sense of what it's all about -- major events and personages, etc. Usually out of this comes a sense of the specific areas I want to treat in the book. This leads me to further reading on those subjects; secondary sources lead me to the primary sources where I find invaluable detail that gives the story a feeling of immediacy -- reality. <p>Research never stops during the writing, however. When I write a chapter I'm always consulting computer files, notebooks, and handwritten yellow pads for specific points to include. Fact checking during editing and even proofreading I suppose could be called the final stage of the research process.<p><i><b>cwbr: What makes the Civil War an attractive subject for you to engage as a citizen and a writer?</b></i><p><b>jj</b>: The appeal of our Civil War is obvious: the inherent drama of American fighting American, in the years of the greatest social change, in the shortest time, in all of our history. My long-held interest in Civil War spying was sparked by reading I did years ago. I always wanted to do a book on the subject, and ultimately this led to <i>On Secret Service</i>.<p><i><b>cwbr: How does <i>On Secret Service</i> compare with North and South in terms of its plot, characters, and style? What are the basic elements and devices of any good novel?</b></i><p><b>jj</b>: <i>On Secret Service</i> is about two-thirds the length of <i>North and South</i> (Signet, ISBN 0451200810, $7.99 softcover), the first book of the trilogy; a much leaner work, because the economics of publishing today don't favor great long doorstop books of the kind I've written in the past. Also, I felt that a story focusing on the rather narrow world of espionage could be contained successfully in a shorter book. It seemed to work. <p>The novel contains no stylistic innovations, because I try not to indulge in them. I believe in the power of good strong declarative sentences. And, since my books are translated all over the world, I don't want to make the translator's job harder. <p>The elements that contribute to any good novel are those that are often cited: strong, memorable characters, including at least one you care about deeply. Strong narrative drive from the first sentence, paragraph, and page. Unrelenting suspense, not in the sense that suspense is used in talking about crime novels, but the simpler fact of wondering what will happen next: the kind of writing that makes people sit up until 2 a.m. to reach the end of the story.<p><i><b>cwbr: What's next for you, now that you've made a ""one-time"" return to the Civil War with On Secret Service?</b></i><p><b>jj</b>: Next up is a novel on a subject I've wanted to write about for more than a decade -- the colorful, often tragic history of South Carolina, where I live most of the year. After that, it's my intention to write the third volume of The Crown Family Saga, to follow <i>Homeland</i> (Signet, ISBN 0451198425, $7.99 softcover) and <i>American Dreams</i> (Signet, ISBN 0451197011, $7.99 softcover).<p><i>Described as the ""godfather of the historical novel"" and the ""contemporary master of the family saga,"" <b>John Jakes</b> has authored more than 60 books, including The North and South Trilogy.

1854	811716031		Tarnished Scalpels: The Court-Martials of Fifty Union Surgeons		Lowry, Thomas P.	Welsh, Jack D.		"<b>Tarnished Scalpels</b> tells the story of 50 Union doctors who, for various reasons, faced military court-martials, some for misdeeds that stagger the imagination. Society of Civil War Surgeons members Thomas P. Lowry, author of <i>The Story the Soldiers Wouldn't Tell</i> and  <i>Tarnished Eagles</i>, and Jack D. Welsh, author of <i>Medical Histories of Union Generals</i> and <i>Medical Histories of Confederate Generals</i>, have collaborated to produce an exceptional new book. <p> The court-martials are organized into six sections that contain cases of failure to practice proper medicine and of failure to follow military rules and regulations. One important fact that Lowry and Welsh point out in their introduction is that, ""In order to judge whether a doctor has failed to practice his art correctly, it is necessary to understand what he should have known, not by our standards but by his.""  <p> <b>Patient neglect and doctor incompetence</b> <p> In the first section, entitled ""Care of patients,"" the reader is presented with 14 cases in which doctors were charged with patient neglect. Many were acquitted due to unsubstantiated facts or maliciousness on the part of the accuser. Others were found guilty of neglect, incompetence, ""conduct unbecoming,"" etc. In the next section, we encounter cases that are ""Stranger than fiction,"" including that of a surgeon who performed a circumcision without anesthetic and ""did scar the cut parts with a hot iron."" He was never court-martialed. ""Misuse of food and money,"" the third chapter, revolves around those doctors who were charged with the misuse of hospital food and money, or simply of ""messing"" (i.e., eating) with enlisted men. Many, it seems, were unjustly accused. <p> ""Wine and women"" details those doctors who were court-martialed for imbibing while on duty or for becoming involved with ladies of ill repute. ""Rules and Authority,"" the fifth section, reminds readers that many of the Civil War doctors were in civilian practice before the conflict erupted. Not only did they have to deal with the medical hierarchy, but they suddenly had to contend with the rules and regulations of army life. Many ran afoul of those regulations, including one Clement A. Finley, who became Surgeon General in June 1861. Finley eventually faced numerous court-martials for ""conduct unbecoming an officer and gentleman,"" ""disobedience,"" and ""violation of the 88th paragraph of the Medical Regulations of the Army."" The final section in <b>Tarnished Scalpels</b> deals with doctors who were charged with being ""Absent Without Leave."" Finally, three appendices accompany this volume and provide the reader with further explanations about aspects of the court-martials and how they were discovered by the authors. <p> <b>Tarnished Scalpels</b> is an extremely well-written and well-documented book. Some of the cases presented make one wonder how these medical men advanced as far as they did. In other instances, the reader will sympathize with the doctor for the frivolousness of the charges and the waste not only his time, but that of a sitting court. The result is easy to read, with each case including the factual details and a commentary by Lowry and Welsh that fills in the gaps in the factual record. <p> <i>Peter J. D'Onofrio is president of the Society of Civil War Surgeons and editor of the Society's quarterly publication,</i> The Journal of Civil War Medicine. <i>He has authored a compilation of primary sources dealing with Civil War-era medicine that is scheduled for publication later this year.</i>"	D'Onofrio, Peter J.

1524	052594544X		On Secret Service		Jakes, John			"A work of fiction billed as an historical novel should be reviewed by three standards: what is its literary value? how historically accurate is it? how entertaining is it, or, put differently, is it a ""good read""? <br> Only by the last-named standard can <b>On Secret Service</b> be given high marks. For a reader more interested in plot and action than in literary quality and historical accuracy, this spy story with gothic overtones should prove a satisfying read. <br> John Jakes really has done a skillful job of weaving his improbable plot into the larger story of the Civil War in the East. It is all there: rabid politics on both sides of the Potomac, the major battles, and the role of intelligence work in both North and South. He gets the big story right, while writing in a clear style, keeping the narrative moving briskly from cliff-hanger to cliff-hanger, serving up portions of steamy sex in between, and offering us plenty of heroes and heroines to admire and several villains it is fun to hate. <p> <b>Inquiring minds want to know</b> <p> Will the girl who dresses as a soldier to visit Union army camps be raped or will she be returned, her virginity intact, to her widowed father, a traitorous bureaucrat in Washington? Will her Southern-born girl friend leave her cold-blooded, war-profiteering husband for a Yankee undercover agent? Will she expose her psychotic older brother, a Confederate provocateur, in time to prevent the Draft Riots in New York City or the assassination of Abraham Lincoln in 1865? <br> Then we come to the really big question. Was Lafayette C. Baker, the head of the Federal Secret Service, acting on behalf of Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, actually behind the murder of Lincoln? <br> Although I hesitate to question the literary taste of John Jakes's many fans, I did find the interplay of the four main characters - two men and two women - rather forced. Naturally, two of the leading actors are of the Union persuasion and two of the Confederate. They fall in love with people on the wrong side of the War and get caught up in conspiratorial conflicts with members of their own families. Predictably, the action shifts back and forth, not always smoothly, between Washington and Richmond. <br> Habitual readers of romance novels might not find it off-putting for one character to ""disclose"" information about the course of the War to another who should have known it anyway. That is just Jakes's way of keeping the eavesdropping reader aware of what is happening in other quarters. <br> Romance novel readers also might have no problem with the way in which the characters in that Victorian Age so easily fall in love and into bed with each other. <br> And those with only a casual knowledge of the War might not be bothered by characters referring to Robert E. Lee familiarly as ""Bob Lee"" or to Stonewall Jackson as ""Tom Jackson"" or to John Wilkes Booth as ""Johnny Booth."" They might not raise their eyebrows at descriptions of ""deep craters"" being left by the shells of Confederate field artillery, ▀ la the Western Front in World War I, or the presence of a fire burning in a railway carriage's stove on a day in May, or the implication that a large part of Mosby's Confederate partisans were Union Army deserters, or the false assertion that Lee's numbers in the Seven Days Battles were greatly inferior to those of McClellan, or the assumption that the Battle of Gettysburg lasted two days rather than three. <br> An earlier reviewer of his works called Jakes ""the godfather of the historical novel."" Some might think Kenneth Roberts or Hervey Allen more deserving of that title. <br> Enough of the quibbling. If even a deep-dyed Civil War buff can get past the early chapters of the book, and set aside his nitpicking knowledge of the War, he will find himself turning the pages to see what happens next. <p> <i>Robert H.

1098	700610251		North Over South: Northern Nationalism and American Identity in the Antebellum Era		Grant, Susan-Mary			"<b>North Over South</b> is a study of the development of nationalist thought in the northern United States in the three decades preceding the Civil War's outbreak. Central to this study is Susan-Mary Grant's argument that ""northern nationalism"" increasingly monopolized the ""search for an American national identity"" during that period and, in so doing, effectively excluded the South from contributing to America's self-definition. Although it is not the purpose of the book to explain the War's origins, the argument extends itself effortlessly to show the impossibility of compromise between North and South by the 1850s. This represents a departure from the usual attribution of a bellicose intractability to the southern states alone. <p> One valuable aspect of Grant's work is her ascription of emergent northern nationalism (and of the North as a unified, distinct political section) to the insecurity arising in some of the northern states from industrialization, consequent social upheaval, and increased immigration. This insecurity was heightened, in the minds of local writers and politicians, by the image of an increasingly assertive South, apparently enjoying an enviable degree of social stability and cohesion from its ""peculiar institution."" From this perspective, Grant's treatment of the political crises that stretched from the Mexican War to Senator Charles Sumner's battering at the hands of Preston Brooks strips our understanding of the confidence of hindsight. ""Northern reactions to the antebellum South,"" she writes, ""can be fully understood only in the context of northern concerns for the future of the American republican experiment, which was basically the search for an American national identity."" <p> Less valuable would seem to be Grant's attempt to associate such matters with the wider academic debate on nationalism and national identity. The author herself is aware of two problems here, neither of which she really overcomes: first, ""nationalism scholars"" have trouble defining nationalism and distinguishing it from national identity; second, the same scholars nevertheless cannot resist forcing their ""paradigms"" on the historical material. In paying more attention to vindicating her paradigm than, say, to what can be learnt from a direct comparison with contemporary nationalist movements in Europe, Grant falls short of her ambitious goal. In the process, she may also scatter some confusion in the mind of the less specialized reader.  <p> <b>Elitist, innovative, progressive, and hubristic</b> <p> We are often encouraged to believe that irrational and exploitable popular instincts give rise to nationalism. But what seems clear from the evidence of travel books, newspapers, and political material that Grant presents, and from her focus on particular figures such as Horace Mann and Theodore Parker, is the political debt that nationalism owes to an elitist, innovative, progressive, and hubristic mindset - armed with education programs, social experiments, mission statements, and abstracted humanism - that is the constant companion of ambitious politicians. <p>  Bizarrely, in the light of all this, Grant refers to the northeastern Whig/Republican movement as ""conservative."" Such terminology and paradigms notwithstanding, North Over South provides some stimulating reading in an area of history blighted too often by the retrospective discovery of an all-too-manifest destiny. <p> <i>Ian Crowe was educated at St Catherine's College, University of Oxford and at the University of Bristol.

1848	811715329		Confederate Corsair: The Life of Charles W. Savez Read		Jones, Robert A.			"<i>This review is also available under the following title:</i><br><i><a href=""http://www.cwbr.com/cgi-bin/dbman/cwbr/cwbr.cgi?db=cwbr&uid=default&bool=and&keyword=&ISBN=&Title=sea+hawk&Auth_1=&Publisher=&Reviewer=&Issue_date=&Record_type=---&sb1=---&so1=ascend&view_records=View+Records&nh=1&mh=1"">Sea Hawk of the Confederacy: Lt. Charles W. Read and the Confederate Navy</a></i><p>In a recent issue of this journal a reviewer rightly observed, ""Biographies of Civil War-era naval officers are a scarce commodity and those of Southern officers are even more rare."" That is why the publication of <b>Sea Hawk of the Confederacy</b> and <b>Confederate Corsair</b> is worthy of note. The fact that they are about the same naval officer, and a junior officer at that, makes the event even more interesting and rare. Charles Read is unquestionably one junior officer who rates a biography. <p> Read's Civil War career is so fascinating that it reads like a novel. It certainly is the kind of story that should attract some movie producer. Although the books' titles, ""Sea Hawk"" and ""Corsair,"" suggest that Read was a pirate (another earlier biographer, Bob Weems, called him a ""Buccaneer""), in reality he was a naval officer whose activities were well within the bounds of legitimate warfare, namely the destruction of an enemy's sea-going commerce. A good bit of his brief career had nothing to do with the destruction of the Union's oceanic commerce, but riverine operations (both on land and water) defending the Confederacy. <p> His early life gave no indication of the most capable naval officer that he would become. He was born in 1840 in Yazoo County, Mississippi. Nine years later his father departed for the California gold fields where he subsequently died, leaving a 10-year-old Read virtually on his own. Jones writes that Read was ""impulsive,"" and his shifting career interests seem to support this characterization. At first attracted to journalism, he became bored with it and took up acting. He portrayed a sailor in a play before running away from home, intending to really ship before the masts on a sailing vessel out of New Orleans. <p> Young Read clearly was interested in a nautical career, which led his mother to seek successfully congressional assistance to get her son admitted to the United States Naval Academy. He was one of 52 who made up the class of 1860, of whom only 25 would graduate. His academic career at the Academy, however, was mediocre at best, ranking last in his class. Last he was, but there were classmates who even then recognized his potential. George Dewey and Winfield Scott Schley, both of whom served in the Union navy during the Civil War and became heroes in the Spanish-American War, were well acquainted with Read at the Academy. Admiral Schley later wrote that Read's class ranking ""was in no sense the measure of his intellectual worth, but arose from his lack of application to study. He possessed in high degree common sense - or ought I to say uncommon sense, as everyone does not possess it - that underlies success in every calling. . . . He had sublime courage, he had conspicuous dash, he had great originality, and was aggressive in all that he did."" <p> His career in the United States Navy was short-lived. When Mississippi seceded, he resigned his commission. At that time he was attached to the steam frigate <i>Powhatan</i> deployed off the coast of Mexico. He waited until the frigate returned to New York in the middle of March before departing for the South. The Confederate Navy Department ordered him to the <i>McR'</i>, then fitting out as a warship in New Orleans. It was on the <i>McR'</i> that he first acquired his reputation as a cool but aggressive officer. The <i>McR'</i> was involved in a number of engagements from the Head of the Passes at the mouth of the Mississippi River to New Madrid, Missouri. <p>  But it was the Battle of New Orleans in April 1862, when Flag Officer David Farragut bypassed the forts guarding the city, that Read first distinguished himself. As executive officer, and later commanding officer when his captain was mortally wounded, Read fought Farragut's fleet until the <i>McR'</i> was disabled. He then joined the crew of the ironclad ram <i>Arkansas</i>, fitting out at Yazoo City, Mississippi. In charge of the ship's stern battery, he participated in various actions as the ironclad fought powerful Union naval forces on her way down the Yazoo. Once on the Mississippi, the <i>Arkansas</i> moored at Vicksburg and near Baton Rouge, where she eventually had to be destroyed because of engine failure. <p> Read then spent several weeks directing a battery of heavy guns at Port Hudson on the Mississippi before being assigned to the Confederate raider <i>Florida</i>, which at that time was in Mobile. Serving as a lieutenant and boarding officer he persuaded the ship's captain, John Maffitt, to allow him to convert and command one of the prizes, the Union brig <i>Clarence</i>, into a raider. This inaugurated the exploit that made Read famous or infamous depending on one's allegiance. Sailing up the Atlantic seaboard to Maine, Read and his handpicked crew successfully captured and armed the <i>Tacony, Archer</i>, and revenue cutter <i>Caleb Cushing</i>. All told, he seized 16 vessels before finally being captured himself. Incarcerated at Fort Warren, Massachusetts, he was paroled and exchanged in October 1864. <p> Assigned next to the James River Squadron, he directed a river battery and commanded the squadron's torpedo boats. In February 1865, Confederate Secretary of the Navy Stephen Mallory assigned him to command the side-wheeler <i>William H. Webb</i>, then at Shreveport, Louisiana. Read's audacious and desperate plan was to run the gauntlet of Federal ships and sortie into the Gulf of Mexico where the <i>William H. Webb</i> would become another one of the cruisers. By the time that he reached Shreveport and readied the ship, the War was virtually over. Nevertheless, he headed downstream and was able to pass New Orleans before his way was blocked, forcing him to destroy his vessel. Read would live until 1890, working an assortment of maritime jobs, his last being a New Orleans pilot. <p> The biographies by R. Thomas Campbell and Robert A. Jones describe in graphic detail Read's extraordinary naval career. Readers of these two lively and readable books will find plenty of naval action and adventure. They should certainly appeal to the general reader. With the exception of some details of Read's life, however, there is really nothing new revealed in the books. Both authors depend heavily upon published secondary and primary works for their information, although Jones cites considerably more primary sources than does Campbell, including unpublished documents from the Naval Archives. <p> Reviewing biographies of the same individual simultaneously leads to some interesting discoveries. The contents at times can be surprisingly different. For example, Campbell briefly discusses the Naval Academy's curriculum at the time Read was there, while Jones describes a typical daily schedule. Both authors in their notes and bibliographies include information and evidently manuscripts about Read obtained from his descendants, but with one exception they come from different descendants. Both volumes are heavily illustrated - Jones with 32 and Campbell nearly a hundred - but again, with a few exceptions, they used different sketches and photographs. <p> Jones's bibliography is far longer and does indicate that his research was more extensive. <p> This reviewer has some minor concerns about unsubstantiated statements, erroneous information, and some inadequate notes that are found in both books. There are a few publications not cited by either author that would have been helpful, particularly Richard Winslow III's  <i>'Constructing Munitions of War': The Portsmouth Navy Yard Confronts the Confederacy, 1861-1865</i> and Katherine Brash Jeter's <i>A Man and His Boat: The Civil War Career and Correspondence of Lieutenant Jonathan H. Carter, CSN</i>. <p> All in all, <b>Sea Hawk of the Confederacy</b> and <b>Confederate Corsair</b> are worthy additions to the literature on the naval side of the Civil War. <p> <i>William N. Still, Jr. is professor of history emeritus and former director of the Program in Maritime History and Underwater Archology at East Carolina Univerhsity. His publications include</i> Confederate Shipbuilding (1969), Iron Afloat: The Story of the Confederate Armorclads (1971), <i>and</i> The Confederate Navy (1997)."	Still, Jr., William N.

1856	253337380		A Great Civil War: A Military and Political History, 1861-1865		Weigley, Russell F.			"<b>A Great Civil War</b> explores political and military dimensions of a conflict that has engaged the attention and interest of scholars and laymen alike for 15 decades. The defining innovation in this study is the way in which it integrates analyses of slavery, war, and the politics of the South and the North. The result is that Russell F. Weigley, a distinguished author who has been a major player in the study of American history, opens a new window to the relationship during the Civil War between politics and the battlefield. Any attempt to achieve such breadth is daunting, as the thread of argument can be easily lost. Weigley, though, has succeeded in making his lengthy study plausible and coherent, even if the prose is dense in places. <p> On several topics <b>A Great Civil War</b> lacks a full discussion on issues, as might be expected in any overview of the Civil War. It is particularly deficient in discussion of causation and political resolve. In passing, Weigley cites General John M. Schofield's suggestion that it was ""attacks as that of Franklin, Atlanta and Gettysburg, rather than any failures of defense, that finally exhausted and defeated the Confederate Armies,"" but such apt observations rarely are analyzed further. Lastly, Weigley's book does not really stand alone as an introductory text on the Civil War. Too often, mere mentions of major figures occur in the text. The reader learns that Brigadier General States Rights Gist was killed under Hood at the Battle of Franklin, but is not given any biographical information or contextual reference. <p> Some readers may be puzzled, as I was, by the use of the word ""Great"" in the title. I always found this war to be tragic. However, the author's meaning may emerge at the end of the <b>A Great Civil War</b>, where Weigley evokes the memory of his Union ancestors by noting that for them, like so many others, ""the war would never end."" In fact, the perennial interest in this conflict may never end. Its timelessness could have something to do with honor, as Mrs. Jefferson Davis insisted when declaring, ""I would die or be hung before I would submit to the humiliation"" of defeat. Perhaps for many more people, however, the battle is against racism that continues to offend our sense of justice. <p> <i>Ronald R.

First published by Oxford University Press in 1996, its reissue this year by the University of Georgia Press in softcover is a noteworthy event. It marks the emergence of an American social historian of major importance. <p> William Dusinberre did his graduate work in history at Columbia University. Subsequently, when the University of Warwick was founded in England in 1965, he took a job there and met Edward P. Thompson, the famous British social historian. Thompson's influence in shifting Dusinberre's attention to social history was a decisive one. <p> <b>Them Dark Days</b> focuses upon the rise and fall of the Rice Kingdom in South Carolina and Georgia from 1790 to 1865. Rice production in South Carolina expanded rapidly in the middle of the 18th century when production moved into the swamplands in and around the tidal rivers. Slaves were imported from West Africa, and American agricultural innovators adapted Dutch polderland (swampland) technology. To conquer the swamps and bring them under cultivation took as much human effort as was needed to build an Egyptian pyramid. Dikes were thrown up by gangs of slaves armed with spades, floodgates were installed, and conduits laid down to channel water to the fields. The swamplands were crisscrossed with irrigation ditches that could be filled with fresh (as opposed to salt) water when the tide was high. This water would be released back into the river days or weeks later, when the tide was out. <p> By 1860, rice production in the Georgia and South Carolina polderlands had grown into a highly profitable business concentrated in the hands of a tiny group of wealthy planters. These men were agricultural capitalists driven by a passion for profit. Twenty-four families, with 300 or more slaves each, together owned one-half of the 48,000 slaves who toiled on the rice plantations. The big rice planters, Dusinberre points out, were also rulers of the South. They championed secession and war as the best way to protect their vast investment in ricelands and slaves. <p> Dusinberre centers his attention on three of the biggest Lowcountry rice plantations: Charles and Louis Manigault's Gowrie, a Georgia plantation eight miles upstream from Savannah; Robert Allston's Chicora Wood plantation in the Waccamaw-Pee Dee peninsula area; and Pierce Butler's Butler Island, a diked swamp in the Altamaha River, ten miles upstream from the Atlantic beaches. <p> Fortunes were amassed from rice at a high cost in human life. On all three plantations, the child mortality rate was as high as 90 percent for children up to age 16. Mothers, having undergone many confinements and miscarriages, often ended up with no more than one or two children who survived past adolescence. Adult slaves in the prime of life died of sunstroke, exhaustion, malarial fevers, tuberculosis, and pneumonia. Slave marriages were destroyed constantly by the death or deportation of one of the partners. <p> The black captives were driven to daily labor by the lash. They resisted their tormentors in various ways, but rarely resorted to open violence against them: the military balance of power, as Dusinberre points out, was overwhelmingly against them. They lamed animals, ""bogged mules,"" broke ploughs, untied the tethers of boats, and botched repairs. Above all, they sought relief by fleeing, at least for a short while, to surrounding swamps, islands, and woodlands. ""The slaves,"" as Dusinberre sums up on page 201, ""were locked into a class conflict of epic proportions, pitting a largely homogeneous class of slaves against profit-seeking masters. . . .""  <p> Where Gowry and Chicora Wood are concerned, the Manigault and Allston papers provide the core evidence on which Dusinberre bases his story. Frances Anne Kemble's  <i>Journal of a Residence on a Georgian Plantation in 1838-1839</i> provides the evidence for Butler Island and Butler Point on St. Simons Island. Kemble, a celebrated stage actress turned wife of Pierce Butler, Jr., and mistress of the Butler plantations, compiled a record of the slavery experience as voiced primarily, though not exclusively, by black slave women. In devoting one whole section of his book to Kemble's record, Dusinberre writes, ""I have sought to listen carefully to the testimony of black witnesses."" He sets Kemble's <i>Journal of a Residence</i> into the wider context of the Rice Kingdom as a whole. This is a contribution that serves both to highlight the significance of that record and also to substantiate it. <p>  Catherine Clinton, author of  <i>The Plantation Mistress: Woman's World in the Old South</i>, and visiting professor of history at Baruch College, now comes with two books on Kemble. The first of these, <b>Fanny Kemble's Civil Wars</b>, focuses primarily on Kemble's unhappy domestic life. Clinton devotes barely one-third of a chapter, or 200 lines in a book of 268 pages, to Kemble's Georgia experience and to the creation of her <i>Journal of a Residence</i>. She has little to say about the <i>Journal of a Residence</i> itself, limiting herself to the remark, on page 178, that it is ""a haunting diatribe against human bondage."" A diatribe, according to my dictionary, is ""a piece of wearisome denunciatory rhetoric."" <p> This study does underline a point which, to be sure, others have made before Clinton. Frances Kemble arraigned American slave masters for high crimes against humanity. For this she paid a heavy price: a shattered marriage, a long separation from her children, and ultimately a permanent estrangement from her younger daughter, Frances Butler Leigh. <p> It would seem that Clinton was not entirely satisfied with <b>Fanny Kemble's Civil Wars</b>. Was it not weakened by its failure to explore Kemble's literary heritage, and in particular to examine and evaluate the <i>Journal of a Residence</i>? And what about Kemble's service in bringing African-American women to the forefront of our history: does that not deserve recognition? <p> To answer such questions, Clinton offers a second book, entitled <b>Fanny Kemble's Journals</b>, presenting a chronological narrative of Kemble's life in her own words. Here the <i>Journal of a Residence</i> is given pride of place. Selections from the <i>Journal of a Residence</i> take up no less than one-third of the entire book. The balance of the work is filled out by selections from the travel journal that Kemble published in 1835, and by letters from Kemble's voluminous published correspondence. <p> It is regrettable that <b>Fanny Kemble's Journals</b> has few maps and illustrations. It would have been strengthened in particular by drawing more exhaustively on the work of Alice Ravenel Huger Smith. Smith, daughter and granddaughter of rice planters and outstanding American watercolorist, created during the 1920s a number of marvelous paintings of the old Rice Kingdom. But, leaving aside the shortcomings of book design, <b>Fanny Kemble's Journals</b> is a useful introduction to the story of Kemble's life in the United States, especially during the period 1832 to 1865. <p> Although the two books have been published simultaneously, <b>Fanny Kemble's Journals</b> supplants rather than supplements <b>Fanny Kemble's Civil Wars</b>. The <i>Journal of a Residence</i> is no longer a ""haunting diatribe"" but a ""searing indictment of slavery"" and Kemble's ""most enduring literary contribution."" It is rendered more powerful, Clinton points out, because it ""is interlaced with [Kemble's] own struggle over her marriage, her future, and her children."" These are wise words. The struggle against slavery was central to Kemble's life; this was the moral force that created a chasm between Kemble and her husband and resulted in the disintegration of her family. <p> <i>John Anthony Scott is the editor of the definitive modern edition of Frances Anne Kemble's</i> Journal of a Residence on a Georgian Plantation in 1838-1839 <i>(1961, reissued 1984) and author of</i> Fanny Kemble's America <i>(1973).</i>"	Scott, John Anthony	Winter 2001	2000-12-01	Review	Actress turned plantation mistress decried horrors of slavery	Command performance	Simon & Schuster Books	2000-09-01				"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=241 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/CatherineClintonFannyKemble'sCivilWars.jpg"">"

2195	684846098		Nothing Like It in the World		Ambrose, Stephen E.			"<i>This review is also available under the following title:</i><br><i><a href=""http://www.cwbr.com/cgi-bin/dbman/cwbr/cwbr.cgi?db=cwbr&uid=default&sb1=11&so1=descend&sb2=3&so2=ascend&ma=on&fields1=Title&value1=dismal+swamp&view_records=1&bool=and&nh=1&mh=1"">The Fabulous History of the Dismal Swamp Company: A Story of George Washington's Times</a></i><p>Make no small plans, ran British political wisdom, as they lack the power to move men's souls. Europeans in America took that advice to heart. From fountains of youth to cities of gold and continental fur trading empires, America stimulated gigantic dreams. Nothing seemed too large for ultimate accomplishment or too improbable for stupendous profit. These habits of thought, begun with exploration and discovery, continued into the 18th and 19th centuries, and are the common subject of two major works: Charles Royster's book on land speculation, <b>The Fabulous History of the Dismal Swamp Company</b>, and Stephen E. Ambrose's volume on the transcontinental railroad, <b>Nothing Like It in the World</b>. <p> The huge plans that both these books describe involved the exploitation of America's most valuable resource: land. The Dismal Swamp Company wished to drain the swamp, cut its trees, settle farmers on its soil, and dig a canal to connect the reclaimed lands to the Norfolk market. The Central Pacific and Union Pacific railroad companies planned to span the continent, open up the West to settlement, farming, timbering, and mining, and connect all America to the great markets in Chicago and New York. Both projects were undertaken with vastly inadequate capital and involved costs far beyond even pessimistic initial projections. <p> But the differences between the Dismal Swamp Company and the transcontinental railroad were more important than the similarities. The Dismal Swamp Company suffered from the use of slave labor, dated engineering technology, little of the governmental support vital to so large an undertaking, and management that was exceptionally inept and indolent. The transcontinental railroad benefited from substantial government help, had a free and disciplined labor force trained in teamwork by the recent war, enjoyed effective management, and utilized the latest steam-powered technology. Not surprisingly, the transcontinental railroad was completed in seven years, while the Dismal Swamp project lingered for years with little progress. <p> The Dismal Swamp Company was put together by a politically powerful coterie of interrelated Virginia aristocrats in 1763, though the concept had been around since a proposal from Colonel William Byrd in 1728. But the idea persisted, and on May 25, 1763, the Dismal Swamp Company presented a petition, with 151 signers, but only 12 partners, for a grant of the swamp. All of the partners were Virginia aristocrats or British merchants to whom the former owed money. George Washington was among the fortunate dozen. All assumed they would make a fortune. But things did not go well. The partners resisted sinking money or slave labor into logging, draining, fencing, and settling the swamp; they desired immediate profits. As the years passed with no effective or systematic exploitation, war and revolution disturbed Virginia, debt went unpaid, aristocratic families slid into bankruptcy, North Carolina poachers cut timber, and only during the administration of James Madison were any dividends paid. It was not an inspiring saga. <p> Royster has narrated this huge tapestry of domestic and public life across five generations of Virginians with affection and generosity, using the technique developed by Sir Lewis Namier in <i>The Structure of Politics at the Accession of George III</i> (Macmillan, 1929). Namier argued that English politics, confined to a smallish group of aristocrats, did not deal primarily with ideologies, ideals, or issues but instead revolved around the familial and social connections of the Members of Parliament along with their financial, business, and agricultural interests. Virginia politics was also the activity of aristocrats connected by marriage, by a similar interest in land and tobacco, by mutual investments in numerous land speculations in the West, and by vast debts owed here and abroad. They possessed the right connections to enjoy inclusion in land schemes, to carry debt for generations, to serve in public office, and to make advantageous marriages. Royster traces these connections, describing the marriages, births, deaths, bankruptcies, inheritances, offices, protested bills of exchange, and lawsuits. A huge cast populates the book, but two are central to this chronicle of well-connected cousins and in-laws: Mary Willing Byrd who died in 1814 and was related to virtually all of the Americans involved in the Dismal Swamp Company, and Samuel Gist, dead in 1815, a British merchant who held paper on virtually all of the Virginians involved in the Company. Debts, dreams, and generations, all written in the elegiac tones of a minor key. <p> Move ahead two generations from Federal Virginia to the Civil War, which created modern America out of blood and freedom and industry and technology. In the decade or so between the Mexican War and what my grandmother called the <i>recent</i> unpleasantness, a transcontinental railroad became an increasingly imperative national necessity. But, while the discovery of gold in California drove the project on, the politics of slavery held it up. The impossibly vexed issue was location. Ought the road to run through slave states or through free states? The Civil War simplified this issue, as it did so many in mid-century American politics. The route explored by Major General Grenville Dodge and supported by Abraham Lincoln prevailed, and the eastern terminus of the Union Pacific would be Omaha, Nebraska. From the west, the Central Pacific began in Sacramento and crossed the Sierra Nevada range along a route pioneered by Theodore Judah. They would meet somewhere, sometime, somehow. <p> Problems of government legislation and raising private capital became the constant nagging worry of the railroad builders. In the west, the Central Pacific partners, California's ""Big Four"" of Leland Stanford, Charles Crocker, Collis P. Huntington, and Mark Hopkins, raised enough in promises, paper, and cash to spike the first rail on October 23, 1863. The Union Pacific, dominated by Thomas Durant and run by Grenville Dodge, had sufficient difficulties with money, rails, ties, engines, and stock (both rolling and paper) that it laid no track until July 1865. <p> Once started, the Union Pacific pushed west along Dodge's route, spurred by the need to collect as much in government subsidies as possible. Corruptly managed by Durant, the road was a continuing miracle of technology, efficient engineering, and skilled labor. Trained to teamwork and industrial organization by the war, the free labor functioned superbly, if profanely. The work continued relentlessly, despite frequent wrecks that always produced casualties, in one of which ""several ladies were badly mangled."" Where towns were set up, temporary camps (cheerfully called ""Hell on Wheels"") appeared, containing taverns, gambling dens, and brothels. Immensely hard work required occasional blow-outs. The Central Pacific, whose labor was largely Chinese, had different problems. One was food, which had to be Chinese, and a second was the mountains. But the workers cut tunnels through granite by hand, worked and lived in snow tunnels 10 feet deep, and slowly built the road over the mountains. In 1868 they broke through and began the push across Nevada to the east, toward the Union Pacific racing west. <p> On May 8, 1869, the two roads were joined at Promontory Point, Utah, in a celebration announced by telegraph to the entire country. In Salt Lake City, one John Taylor spoke about having been on the first railroad ever built, between Manchester and Liverpool. In one single lifetime . . .  <p> Ambrose tells this tale of railroad building in terms of work, organization, discipline, and engineering, rather than the usual narrative of corruption, stock-jobbing, and influence peddling. He is interested in the terrain, the workers, and the engineers, and treats the transcontinental railroad as an heroic enterprise. He takes his tone from Vergil: ""So hard and huge a task it was"" to span the continent and bring together the new America. The railroads in the 19th century combined much of the best and the worst of America, and Ambrose concentrates on the best. Those looking to this powerfully written book for a standard screed against the robber barons will be disappointed; this book describes what makes America both an industrial and democratic success. <p> An English visitor to America, Charles William Janson, toured Virginia and the Dismal Swamp, and reported that ""speculation"" was ""the life of the Americans."" Attitudes had changed little between his visit in the 1790s and the 1860s, but America by then had acquired the capacity to translate huge dreams into technology and infrastructure, and entrepreneurs became rich while enriching the whole society. Royster and Ambrose describe these two eras in the American adventure, from when things could be dreamt but not done, to when the only limit was the dream itself. <p> <i>James D.

1545	380976439		Shadows of Glory		Parry, Owen			"<b>Shadows of Glory</b> is Owen Parry's second Abel Jones historical suspense novel. The first mystery, <i>Faded Coat of Blue</i>, was set in Washington, D.C., at the very beginning of the conflict. It received very favorable reviews. The present installment takes place mostly in the Finger Lakes region of western New York, during the winter of 1862, and is no less deserving of praise. <p> On the surface a work of genre fiction, which the academic community is often too quick to dismiss, Parry's novel opens after President Lincoln's personal secretary, John Nicolay, has dispatched Major Abel Jones to Penn Yan, New York, to investigate a rumored Irish uprising. Two previous observers have both been killed and Jones soon finds his own effigy hanging from a tree. <p> The major is, to say the least, an unconventional protagonist for a mystery series. An immigrant Welshman and veteran of England's wars in India, Jones is a teetotaling, extremely conscientious, penny-pinching Union officer, who despises war almost as much as he does horses. Throughout the story, he spouts erroneous forecasts concerning topics such as the likely duration of the war, the fate and value of the suffragist movement, and the length of time it will take former slaves to be accepted as equals. He is also an unending source of such homey maxims as ""order is virtue, and too much thought breeds indolence and error.""  <p> Aided by an intriguing cast of characters, including his roguish friend Jimmy Molloy, the  elephant-eared Sheriff Underwood, and a young, tubercular mystic named Nellie Kildare, Jones soon decides that there is no uprising in the works against the United States. He believes, however, that Nellie's supposed father, ""The Great"" Kildare, and the local Irish population are definitely plotting something. Jones eventually uncovers a plan that, if successful, would virtually ensure the demise of the Union he holds dear. <p> The fact that <b>Shadows of Glory</b> is an historical novel, of course, diminishes the level of suspense, but Parry goes beyond the boundaries of a straightforward mystery by exploring larger cultural issues of the time. The most notable example is the contrast between the North's simultaneous zeal for abolition and its gross mistreatment of Irish immigrants. <p> Some pointless appearances of historical figures, such as Susan B. Anthony and Abraham Lincoln, as well as digressions to Grant's war in the West, may perturb those readers more interested in the mystery than the history. Though not perfect, <b>Shadows of Glory</b> is well-researched, lyrically written, and thoroughly entertaining. <p> <i>Thomas Hill received an M.A. in history from Oklahoma State University and is currently working toward an M.F.A. in writing at the University of Memphis.</i>"	Hill, Thomas	Winter 2001	2000-12-01	Review	Lincoln's colorful sleuth Abel Jones investigates civilian unrest	Trouble in the Finger Lakes	William Morrow & Company, Inc.	2000-09-01				"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=244 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/OwenParryShadowsofGlory.jpg"">"						
1469	679456503		The Making of Robert E. Lee		Fellman, Michael			"A towering figure in American history - whether depicted in marble or clay - Robert E. Lee continues to draw the attention of historians. The last quarter-century has seen a sustained assault on Lee's legacy and the mythology that was constructed around it to vindicate the Confederate cause. Recent decades have seen a cascade of books seeking to demythologize Lee. With the exception of such balanced texts as Emory Thomas's 1995 <i>Robert E. Lee: A Biography</i>, these works have generally engaged in such historical overkill that they have not only exploded the myth but also obscured the man. <p> Michl Fellman's previous work, <i>Citizen Sherman</i>, was a controversial psychobiography of the great Union general. In <b>The Making of Robert E. Lee</b>, Fellman now applies the same methods to Lee. Indeed, this work is not so much a full biography of Lee as it is a rolling psychoanalysis of him. Fellman dissects Lee's writings, trying to discern (or guess) the attitudes, feelings, and beliefs that might have lain behind them. The process is at times more imaginative and intuitive than it is analytical. <p> In his analysis of Lee's thinking, Fellman is at his best in dealing with the general's Civil War career. Commendably, he looks beyond the literal claims when interpreting Lee's military statements, such as his attempts to cast the failed northern incursions in the best light. By comparing Lee's correspondence from different times, he reveals a general whose strategic aspirations were not at all the modest goals he represented after events had dashed his more ambitious hopes. <p> With even more impressive insight, Fellman traces the shifts in Lee's state of mind during the War. Throughout the early and, from Lee's point of view, highly unsatisfactory part of the War, Lee maintained a spirit of patient resignation, but with his assumption of the command of the Army of Northern Virginia and the beginning of his subsequent string of stunning battlefield successes, Lee gave way to a more aggressive mindset. The passiveness, humility, and resignation that had been the hallmarks of his personality up to that time became less pronounced in the exultation of a fierce warrior who reveled in victory. It was, as Fellman astutely points out, perhaps the only aspect of Lee's life in which the austere Virginian allowed almost free rein to his inner passions. <p> Lee's great offensive victories fell within the space of a single year. They began with his success in the Seven Days campaign of late June and early July 1862 and ended with the close of the first day's fighting at Gettysburg, July 1, 1863. With the end of this amazing year, Lee reverted in many ways to his former resigned and passive mode. The gradual decline in Southern fortunes coincided with Lee's own growing health problems, and Lee met both in a spirit of patient submission to divine will.  <p> While Fellman's analysis of Lee's wartime career is interesting and enlightening, other parts of his psychoportrait of Lee are more troubling and less convincing. More than Lee's strategic genius and battlefield leadership, it has been the Virginia general's sterling character, impeccable morals, and selfless devotion to duty that have, over the 130 years since his death, made him the admiration of both North and South. Whether Americans considered his choice of the Confederate cause admirably noble or tragically misguided, they could agree in prizing the many virtues he epitomized. Even today, after a quarter-century of attack, scarcely any of Lee's critics have questioned his self-control or his devotion to duty. Even Fellman allows for the presence of these traits in Lee, at least in part; he seems to question only their virtue. <p> As he states on the final page, Fellman's purpose in assessing Lee's character is to demonstrate that he represented the parochial values of a single time and place, ""not universal ones."" <b>The Making of Robert E. Lee's</b> attack on Lee as an enduring moral exemplar takes two angles. The first is to question, to a moderate degree, Lee's possession of the virtues that have hitherto been attributed to him. This he does through an extremely free interpretation of Lee's writings. For example, other scholars have noted letters Lee wrote to young female friends. Some passages of these letters could reasonably be construed as mildly flirtatious, but Fellman goes much further, torturing from these letters - and others even more innocent - what he sees as indications of at least some illicit contact. On page 243 he quotes an 1869 letter of Lee's to Laura Mason Chilton: ""Your invitation to your wedding . . . has carried me back to the pleasant days when you were a little girl in Texas, when you and [your sister] Emmie gave me so much pleasure, the purest if not the greatest I enjoyed while there."" Fellman follows this up with the comment, ""Remembering the lovely little girls had triggered memories of less pure pleasures with another, grown woman as well, Lee hinted."" He obviously hinted nothing of the sort. <p> Denying Lee his well-established virtues is something Fellman does relatively rarely in this book. To a large degree even he must admit that Lee exercised great self-control and frequently set aside his own selfish desires in order to fulfill his duty as he understood it. Hence the second prong of Fellman's analysis, in which he pervasively contends that these qualities were far from virtuous. Sometimes the author's judgment on this score is dazzlingly apparent. On page 303, Fellman states: ""Unquestioning obedience to duty, deep emotional repression in the name of self-control and self-denial, endless discipline, and the attempt to enact moral purity, taken as a package, now seem rather less than humble and psychologically realistic and even can appear to amount to an invitation to hypocrisy."" The thinking that is here explicitly stated is implicitly assumed throughout the work. Fellman implies that setting aside one's selfish desires in order to do the right thing, denying one's baser impulses in favor of noble duty, ""now"" can be properly understood as ""emotional repression,"" not a virtue but a pathology. <p> One would almost think from Fellman's analysis of Lee that the only valid and healthy reason for a man to refrain from serial adultery is that he feels no temptation to that sin. Such thinking is no doubt a sign of the times, the scholarly expression of a decade in which the people of the United States (Fellman, be it noted, is a Canadian) supported a president of spectacularly debauched character who repeatedly committed disgraceful acts in the Oval Office with a woman the age of his daughter, then minutes later walked into church with his wife on one arm and an oversized Bible in the other. Modern culture seems as ready to succumb to its impulses as it is to detect ""invitations to hypocrisy"" in earlier, more virtuous eras. <p> Fellman's book is interesting, sometimes enlightening, sometimes shocking, and sure to be controversial, but his attempt to redefine the moral measurement of Robert E. Lee tells more about our modern age than it does about a man who, with all of the virtues he cultivated so diligently and the faults he knew only too well, is beyond the reach of the late 20th century's judgments. <p> <i>Steven E.

1563	345433262		Slaves of Obsession		Perry, Anne	Nevler, Leona		<p>Well-known for her ability to weave mystery, history, details of daily life, and 19th century technology into a fine Victorian tapestry, Anne Perry constructs more of a crazy quilt in <b>Slaves of Obsession</b>, the 11th book in her William Monk series. <p> The novel opens in London on the eve of the American Civil War. Lyman Breeland, a Union officer, aims to reverse the sale of rifles promised to the Confederacy. Arms dealer Daniel Alberton refuses to renege on his word, and when he is found murdered, Breeland is implicated but cannot be questioned, for he apparently has absconded to America with the rifles and with Alberton's 16-year-old daughter, Merrit, who is infatuated with the idealistic officer's anti-slavery rhetoric. <p> Not one to give up so easily, the widowed Mrs. Alberton hires Monk and his wife Hester to locate and return her daughter. If, in the process, they can also deliver Breeland, so much the better. Perry creates contrasting personalities in the novel's antagonists. Breeland's anti-slavery ideals match our own, but his lack of concern for Merrit when she is arrested as his accomplice paints him as cold and unappealing. Philo Trace, the Confederate who originally purchased the rifles, reluctantly contemplates the abolition of slavery, arguing that the Union and England willingly benefit from its products, yet he appears warm and caring in his concern for Merrit and her mother. Will Perry dare make either of these gentlemen the true villain? <p> Perry writes graphic, convincing war scenes, and creates an interesting role reversal as Monk and his wife unwittingly become involved in the first battle at Manassas. The chaos and carnage overwhelm Monk, who has never experienced war. Hester relives the horrors of mangled bodies, filth, and death she witnessed in the Crimea where she served with Florence Nightingale. She nurses the wounded in the field and at a makeshift hospital set up in Sudley Church; she removes a bullet, amputates an arm, and seems well versed in anatomy. Since Nightingale focused on cleanliness for religious reasons and germ theory awaited discovery, those interested in 19th century medical care may find areas for debate, and wonder how much Perry has played with Hester's probable knowledge and surgical background. <p> Unfortunately, the quickness and intricacy of plot that give <b>Slaves of Obsession</b> so much of its compulsive readability have attendant drawbacks. The book is not always well organized and lacks in clarity at times. Diverse events surrounding Mediterranean pirates, the Third Chinese War, and the death of an artist's model seem patched together and not always believably related. Scattered throughout the book are inconsistencies in plot detail and a lack of tight editing. For example, while still alive, Alberton had  employed William Monk to investigate blackmail, but that subplot ties in only weakly at the end of the novel. Hints about Monk's possible prior connections to slavery are confusing, especially to first-time readers of the series. <p>  Few history-mystery writers surpass Anne Perry, but readers new to the genre may wish to begin their association with William Monk by starting with the first book in the series,<i> Face of a Stranger</i>. And devoted readers of Civil War fiction might enjoy comparing Hester's nursing experiences to those of a Richmond woman in Ann McMillan's novel<i> Dead March</i>. <p> <i>A historical researcher, Diana E.

2190	807825816		INTERVIEW:<p>The 'unwritten war' no longer: Alice Fahs explores popular literature of the Civil War		Bates, Bonnie L.			"<p><b><i>Civil War Book Review (cwbr): In </i>The Imagined Civil War,<i> you note that popular literature during this time was ""part of a shared culture.""  Why does it have resonance in the literary world today?</i></b> <p> <b>Alice Fahs (af):</b> Popular literature can offer a wider, more comprehensive sense of the character of any era. Sometimes the insights we can gain from popular literature simply aren't available from more ""highbrow"" literature. For instance, black characters and white women characters appeared prominently in popular wartime literature, but much less frequently in war literature by the canonical authors we've all studied in school, such as Herman Melville or Stephen Crane. <p> One of the real surprises for me in doing research for this book was finding such a vast amount of wartime popular literature. The sheer number of sources, especially in the North, was stunning, including everything from sensational novels to children's stories. Our literary world today, with its own outpouring of popular literature, is not so different from the literary marketplace during the war. <p> <b><i>cwbr: You characterize much of the popular literature of the era as ""sentimental."" Why did 19th century contemporaries find this quality so appealing?</i></b> <p>  <b>af</b>: Sentimentalism was a mode of thought and way of being that was central to mid-19th century identity. It primarily stressed the importance of emotion in an individual's life, valuing ""heart"" over ""head,"" and was closely linked to the rise of evangelicalism as well as a new culture of sensibility in the antebellum era. <p> During the war, literary sentimentalism became an im-portant mode of coping with unprecedented mass slaughter; sentimental stories and poems stressed the importance of soldiers' individual sacrifices and provided deathbed scenes in which dying soldiers transformed the lives of those around them. Sentimental popular literature tried to compensate for the unbearable loss of so many men. <p> <b><i>cwbr: Do you think feminized war literature (that is, literature that stressed the roles women could play in the war effort) had an overall positive or negative effect on women's attitudes toward the war? Did it have lasting effects on literature once the war was over?</i></b> <p> <b>af</b>: It's hard to determine how popular literature directly shaped women's attitudes toward the war because little historical evidence exists of their reactions to such literature. Yet a strong indication of the influence of such literature lies in the sheer volume of it. In the last years of battle, for instance, hundreds of war romances were published in major magazines and weeklies such as <i>Harper's Weekly</i>. One reason for its popularity was that feminized war literature, like sentimental literature of dying soldiers, attempted to compensate for women's losses in the war. Over and over, such literature made women's own suffering the centerpiece of stories, and attempted to give it meaning within a larger patriotic and religious framework. <p> Unfortunately, the roles that women assumed within Civil War popular literature were forgotten in the postwar landscape. During the war itself, women played major roles in sensational novels as spies, crossdressing soldiers, and brave defenders of hearth and home. In more conventional fiction they were also center stage as nurses or as domestic heroines. By the end of the 19th century, however, most fiction about the war centered around the heroism of white soldiers on both sides, despite the efforts of such prominent war workers as Mary Livermore to keep the memory of women's contributions to the war alive. We've really only begun to undo this masculinization of the memory of the war in histories that recover the place of women both in the war effort and in war writings. <p> <b><i>cwbr: You mention that few Southerners read southern literary periodicals during the war, turning instead to imported ones from the North, such as Harper's and the New York Ledger. What explains this phenomenon?</i></b> <p> <b>af</b>: At the beginning of the war, many Southerners had high hopes that they would create a new Confederate literary culture entirely separate from that of the North. Commentators urged their compatriots not to read that ""trashy"" Yankee literature, but instead to read new Confederate literature as an act of patriotism. Once the northern mails stopped, Southerners couldn't receive northern literature anyway (except when it was smuggled through the lines). So it seemed to many writers and publishers that a glorious opportunity had come. Several enterprising publishers did manage to seize the day, producing weeklies in a deliberate attempt to rival such popular magazines as <i>Harper's</i>. But they quickly ran into insuperable problems: not only did shortages of supplies make it difficult to produce magazines, but the war itself was enormously disruptive to the infrastructure, a problem that only grew worse. In addition, northern literary culture was more developed and polished, with many more professional writers. As numerous diaries reveal, Southerners began to miss the literature they had grown accustomed to before the war.  <p> <b><i>cwbr: Northern and southern popular literature dealt with racial issues in very different ways. How do you think this affected society's attitudes toward the newly freed slaves? Did popular literature end up altering societal views about blacks or did it merely reflect those attitudes already present in Civil War culture?</i></b> <p> <b>af</b>: The relationship of literature to social change is quite complicated, and I wouldn't argue that literature by itself was capable of substantially altering views about blacks. But I do think that as enormous social changes began to occur as a result of the war, especially as slaves freed themselves by coming into Union lines, northern popular literature reflected such changes in ways that, in turn, began to shift a larger conversation about race within northern culture. Major periodicals such as <i>Frank Leslie's</i> began the war portraying blacks in grotesque, exaggerated cartoons, but by the end of the war included images of manly blacks drawn from photographs. The publication of images of black soldiers, especially, created new cultural conditions for imagining the role of blacks within American life. Southern wartime literature had a very different agenda: rather than celebrating black soldiers, it worked hard to deny that black men were capable of being soldiers, instead portraying them as childish buffoons in need of white paternalism. As for the legacy of such images, it's clear that black authors such as William Wells Brown later took sustenance from wartime depictions of black soldiers. But he and other black authors fought an uphill battle after the war in an increasingly racist climate in which black participation in the war was minimized or even denied. <p>  <b><i>cwbr: You mention that the railroad and telegraph increased the speed of war-era communication. How did this new technology affect popular literature?</i></b> <p> <b>af</b>: Early in the war, Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote a wonderful essay about how modern the conflict seemed to him. He and countless other Americans expected to get news from the front not just once a day, as in the past, but several times a day as events from the battlefield were relayed by telegraph and then printed in ""extras"" pinned on bulletin boards outside newspaper offices. The intense interest in the war, especially in the North, meant that it was profitable for publishers to produce massive quantities of popular war literature, often in almost immediate response to significant events. That expectation of instantaneity marked the Civil War as different from past wars, and increased the public appetite for popular literature. In the South, the comparative lack of technology meant that publishers were unable to satisfy that same interest in the war. <p> <b><i>cwbr: Do you see anything in modern literature that is analogous to Civil War popular literature?</i></b> <p> <b>af</b>: There are many similarities between modern and 19th century war literature: popular literature has often been ostentatiously patriotic, with clear propagandistic aims. On the other hand, there have been real changes in the ways in which women, say, have been portrayed in such literature. During the Civil War, mothers were portrayed in popular literature in almost sacred terms. But during World War II it was the pinup girl who was used to evoke home instead. And as one wonderful audience member pointed out after a talk I gave last year, during Vietnam, ""mother"" was invoked more as an obscenity than as a cherished ideal. The demands of war, including the need for an absolutely unified home front, produce similarities in war literature, but the changing cultural landscape means differences crop up as well. <p> <b><i>cwbr: Why do you think this type of literature has been so long ignored in modern scholarship?</i></b> <p> <b>af</b>: For many years popular literature was dismissed as ""low"" literature of little interest; people instead read canonical Civil War writers, and critics bemoaned the fact that no great masterpieces had ever resulted from the war. But the recent rise of interest in popular culture of all kinds has opened doors to analysis of Civil War popular culture as well. As a historian, I find Civil War popular literature impor-tant as part of the larger context within which the war was fought. Such literature was part of the war, not separate from it: it was read by men and women on the home front, by soldiers in their tents at the battle front, by travelers on railroad cars, by children both Northern and Southern. It formed part of the fabric of people's lives during the war.<p><i>Alice Fahs, associate professor of history at the University of California, Irvine, has focused her lens on the popular literature of the Civil War, creating a cultural study of a topic rarely treated by historians. Her new book, </i>The Imagined Civil War<i>, defines Civil War popular literature as print material intended for a broad reading public, including sensational war novels, humor, songs, poetry, and histories of the war.

1559	425178048		A Killing at Ball's Bluff		Kilian, Michael			"<b>A Killing at Ball's Bluff</b> is the second installment in Michl Kilian's Harrison Raines Civil War Mystery series. Kilian, Washington, D.C., correspondent for the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> and veteran mystery writer, has chosen to set his historical fiction series around significant battles and some real-life personalities. Our hero is Captain Harrison Raines, scion of a southern family, now employed by Allan Pinkerton in the Union's fledging Secret Service. He has received an anonymous message to protect at all costs a Union colonel named Edward Baker, a longtime friend of Abraham Lincoln. <p> Raines finds Baker at Ball's Bluff, Virginia, where the colonel exhibits the ineptitude and lack of military knowledge that will lead to his death in battle on October 21, 1861. Kilian uses the historical fact of Edward Baker's death to create a murder mystery that finds Raines accused of the very crime he was assigned to prevent. <p> The author spares few details when describing the engagement at Ball's Bluff. Dry facts are interspersed with plenty of dialogue that moves the story along in a convincing fashion. Kilian portrays his protagonist as having few illusions left, even though the war is in its infancy. Raines's father and brother are serving in the Confederate army; his entire family lives below the Mason-Dixon line. But he hates the ""peculiar institution"" and all it stands for, and supports the Union cause. Kilian does a credible job of illustrating the dilemma such a person would face, with loyalties to both sides of the conflict. <p> The novel starts slowly as the author introduces his readers to characters and background information that will eventually bear on the colonel's murder. Kilian's liberal sprinkling of real places and real people-Leesburg and Ball's Bluff, Virginia; the city of Washington; the unfortunate Colonel Baker; President Lincoln; known and unknown Rebel spies; and even John Wilkes Booth-is inspired, demonstrating a great deal of true scholarship. <p> The story then gallops along with Raines chasing after would-be pirates and Rebel agents, uncovering a plethora of disguise and identity confusion that may have the reader reaching for a scorecard. At the heart of the story is the extent that those working behind the scenes, behind petticoats as it were, can influence the course of conflict. In <b>A Killing at Ball's Bluff</b>, Michl Kilian takes the facts of the death of Colonel Baker and creates for his readers a fictional scenario that entertains and educates at the same time. <p> <i>Helen Howerton is the contributing editor for</i> Murder: Past Tense, <i>the journal of the Historical Mystery Appreciation Society.

Catherine Clinton presents the War through human interest pieces, historic illustrations, and photographs, giving young readers a sensitive interpretation of this history.<p>Clinton attempts to explain the many ways this tragic war affected the people living in the North, South, West, and in slavery. Among the political events, social histories, and battle descriptions are relevant biographies, eyewitness accounts, famous and infamous letters, and journal entries.<p>The book's thoughtful cover design is indicative of the approach to the material inside. Young scholars may find it impossible to resist reading the unique entries that make this resource an up-to-date interpretation of the Civil War. Clinton has included articles that are surprising (for example, pets in army camps) and others that are emotional (such as the story of a nine-year-old drummer boy). This approach to presenting history may bring today's children closer to understanding the actions and fate of Americans during the Civil War.<p>Although Clinton has packed her volume with a diverse collection of information, readers should keep in mind that the book is not intended to serve as a detailed reference. Designed for children, the book offers only brief treatment of some subjects. (For instance, fighting in many arenas is discussed, although naval participation is not fully explained.) <p>Locating specific topics through the table of contents may be difficult unless students are already familiar with the history of the Civil War. The index is only two and a half pages, and students who have found a desired topic may not necessarily find other relevant information that is of interest because entries are not cross-referenced and not all of the side notes and human interest articles in the book are listed in the index. Although a few terms are defined within the text, a glossary of names and terms for quick reference is not included.<p>Providing a reference source, however, is not the only goal of a work such as this.

The editors endeavor to provide a close look at how a variety of women from the South were affected by the war and how they chose to cope with it.<p>The women portrayed in these stories were predominantly educated white women from the middle and upper classes of society -- many of whom owned slaves. Some of them were hard working farmers, while others were prominent and pampered members of the Southern aristocracy.<p>Evident throughout this book are both noble and ignoble characteristics exemplified by these women. Many acted selflessly, sacrificing everything to aid the Confederacy. Others were self-centered and resentful in having to share their more patriotic husbands with the Confederate armed forces. Several are portrayed as using the war to satisfy their insatiable desire for adventure and greater freedom. Some meekly accepted their disheartening circumstances out of societal obligations. Among these women, strong support for the Southern cause was often conditional and dependent on their individual situations at any given time in the war. <p>One aspect of this collection stands out as a noteworthy weakness -- its limited scope of Southern women. By no means are the experiences of the women in this book the norm for all Southern women. Significant segments of society are left out. <p>This narrow focus leaves the reader wondering about the wartime lives and circumstances of enslaved and free black women, poor white women, immigrants, Unionists, and women in other less visible stations of the social order, such as servants, factory workers, even prostitutes. As a result of this omission, the overall theme of the women's war in the South is incomplete and misleading. A message is conveyed that less-fortunate women within a community do not necessarily deserve to be included.<p>The strengths of this anthology, however, make it an entirely valuable and worthy addition to the literature of the American Civil War. The firsthand accounts bring a bygone era to life in a way that is not possible with secondary sources. The individual narrations are always engaging and frequently gripping. The subject matter is well documented in the appendix, and commentary is succinct. The editors have allowed the stories to speak for themselves and thus bear witness to the many intimate thoughts, emotions, fears, and everyday struggles experienced by these Southern women. <p><i>Arlyn Danielson is collections manager at the Newseum in Arlington, Virginia, and an avid student of the social history of the Civil War.</i>	Danielson, Arlyn	Summer 1999	1999-06-01	Review	A chronicle of the everyday struggles of Southern ladies	From heart to hearth	Cumberland House					"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=245 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/WaughWomensWarSouth.jpg"">"						
1822	803223803		Banners to the Breeze: The Kentucky Campaign, Corinth and Stones River'		Hess, Earl J.			"A fourth volume in the University of Nebraska's ""Great Campaigns of the Civil War"" series, <b>Banners to the Breeze</b> examines three of the major campaigns associated with the 1862 Confederate resurgence in the upper heartland of Kentucky and Tennessee. Following devastating defeat at the hands of Ulysses S. Grant, Henry Halleck, and Don Carlos Buell that swept Confederate presence from the region, a calculated autumn counteroffensive was intended to restore it to Richmond's control. Adding the pivotal border state of Kentucky to the new nation also would move the frontier to the defensible banks of the Ohio River. Moreover, when coordinated with Robert E. Lee's similar invasion of Maryland, foreign recognition could add yet another prize to the endeavor. It was not to be, as Earl J. Hess ably demonstrates in a well-paced account that appears better directed to an informed public rather than to scholars.<p>The focus of Hess's narrative lies with the Kentucky operation of Braxton Bragg and Edmund Kirby Smith along with the ancillary maneuvers of Earl Van Dorn and Sterling Price in northern Mississippi. The book closes with the bitter winter struggle for Middle Tennessee and Nashville. The series intends to show how campaigns and battles left their imprint on many Americans, from presidents and generals down to privates and civilians. Hess proves that he is comfortable with this genre, having earlier treated <i>The Union Soldier in Battle: Enduring the Ordeal of Combat</i>. <p>True to the series' intent to synthesize scholarship appearing since the Civil War centennial, Hess builds upon the more detailed work of Peter Cozzens, Kenneth J. Hafendorfer, James Lee McDonough, and presumably others (although that is hardly apparent from the abbreviated chapter notes and bibliographic essay). His dramatic narrative, however, portrays anew the blood and gore of the battles of Perryville, Iuka, Corinth, and Stones River. The strategic planning and faltering leadership of Bragg, Smith, Van Dorn, and Price are set against more successful if equally unspectacular performances by Buell and William S. Rosecrans. The national administrations in Washington and Richmond remain in the background, for the most part, although occasional references are made to domestic politics and civilian reaction to the campaigns and battles. Hess correctly assesses that it was Lee's action in the East rather than anything in the Mississippi Valley that conditioned European response to events in late 1862. The real strength of <b>Banners to the Breeze</b> rests in the broadened coverage it provides for the Iuka/Corinth component of the campaign triad.<p>Incorporating some contemporary accounts with newly discovered photographs of the Corinth carnage, Hess revisits campaigns that he thinks have been neglected by most modern historians. His portrayal of men and events at this level is adequate but hardly reflects the rich recent scholarship regarding personalities, organizational and combat arms development, as well as logistics during this period. Moreover, his account overlooks important aspects of war and society in the embattled heartland of 1862. The scholarship of Stephen Ash, Mark Grimsley, Noel Fisher, and this reviewer enjoys little reflection in the text. Hess merely genuflects toward the role of independent cavalry raiders and their partisan auxiliaries that definitely affected the pace of standard military operations. It may be adequate to advance the work of the late Thomas L. Connelly, but the series editors' intent to look beyond battlefield and headquarters tent ""to the wider political and social context within which the campaigns unfolded"" surely warrants a more comprehensive effort.<p><b>Banners to the Breeze</b> is updated traditional military history. In a greatly synthesized manner, it fulfills what series editors Anne J. Bailey and Brooks D. Simpson seek -- ""how the ends and means of waging war reflect larger political objectives and priorities as well as social values."" Hess has done his job, given these guidelines, even if he offers only the most tantalizing glimpse of the military, political, economic, and social events that when properly integrated offer a rich tapestry of what he correctly suggests was a dramatic turning point in the War.  <p><i>Benjamin Franklin Cooling is a professor of grand strategy and mobilization in the Industrial College of the Armed Forces of the National Defense University in Washington, D.C.</i>"	Cooling, Benjamin Franklin	Spring 2000	2000-03-01	Review	A dramatic narrative of opposing armies in the	Counteroffensive in Kentucky	University of Nebraska Press					"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=246 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/EarlHessBannersToTheBreeze.jpg"">"						
2125	801861160		Secret Yankees: The Union Circle in Confederate Atlanta	Secret Yankees: The Union Circle in Confederate Atlanta	Dyer, Thomas G.			"<p>Ever since the historical discovery of internal opposition to the Confederacy as described in Frank L. Owsley's 1925 book, <i>State Rights in the Confederacy</i>, the subject has fascinated scholars of Southern history even while proving curiously unmanageable. For all his genius in puncturing the Lost Cause myth of white solidarity in the Confederacy, Owsley sent historians down the wrong path and marginalized unionism. Opposition to the Confederacy from state rights motives seems anti-Union and ultra-secessionist; more importantly, serious opposition to the Confederacy by no means followed state lines. East Tennessee and West Virginia wanted to join the Union rather than assert the state rights of Tennessee and Virginia.<p>Much of the literature written since Owsley's day on internal opposition to the Confederacy has emphasized class warfare among whites. Yet such emphasis on social class hardly squares with the regional nature of the most serious opposition -- again, East Tennessee and West Virginia offer obvious examples. A focus on class likewise ignores political ideology, patriotism, and another obvious basis of opposition for some confederate citizens, Northern birth.<p>In <b>Secret Yankees</b>, Thomas G. Dyer has uncovered another group of people in opposition to the confederacy, and his book provides the best picture yet offered of urban dissenters in the Confederacy. The ""secret Yankees"" he discovered in Atlanta -- white, black, rich, poor, men, and women -- follow no particular pattern, though Northern birth may be the most salient factor for the white dissenters, and all were apparently unionists. The South had been kind to many of them and they appeared assimilated. Several were well-to-do financially and some were slaveholders. Nevertheless, ""the Union circle"" around Cyrena Stone, whose diary formed the crucial piece of evidence for this book, aided Federal prisoners of war in Atlanta, sympathized with Confederate deserters, hid spies, and offered information to Federal authorities.<p>The submerged world of Cyrena Stone, a Vermont-born Yankee in Jefferson Davis's Atlanta, provides the focus of this work, which is chronologically organized. The very best part of this good book lies in an appendix, ""In Search of Miss Abby"" (Stone's <i>nom de plume</i>), which I suggest reading first. It describes the author's research and problems regarding sources, from the first appearance of the anonymous diary in the hands of a manuscript dealer in 1976 to the full-fledged historical narrative appearing in this book over 20 years later. I cannot imagine a more interesting description of the process of writing an archivally driven piece of history than this appendix.<p>If anything, perhaps, the archival research tyrannizes a bit over the book, and there is an abundance of detail -- furniture inventories, exact escape routes north, and local addresses in Atlanta -- presented at the expense of analysis. The absence of persons prominent in the customary grand narrative of Confederate history adds to the confusion, as there are many characters and all the biographical details are new.<p>But why should anyone complain of new-ness in a Civil War book? Thomas G. Dyer offers an important and original portrait of one form of opposition to the Confederacy, and his book deserves the notice of all who are interested in the history of the Confederacy as something more than the gallant struggles of the Army of Northern Virginia.<p><i>Mark E.

For that and several other reasons, this is an important Civil War era book.<p><b>Parson Brownlow's Book</b> embodies and expresses all the characteristics of the man and the features of his life of public service. Born in Virginia, he spent most of his life in small mountain towns of East Tennessee, working his way over the years westward. From early days as a Methodist Circuit Rider of the Holston Conference, Brownlow migrated to Elizabethtown and Jonesboro and to Knoxville, where he set up newspapers that took controversial stands on religious, social, and political issues. He often stood gladly and aggressively, and even happily, alone among and against his adversaries, and was attacked with equal vigor and vitriol, sometimes physically. <p>The only Union newspaper in the Confederacy<p>For many months, his <i>Knoxville Whig and Rebel Ventilator</i> was the only Union newspaper in the Confederacy, which held Knoxville during that time. When the Union seized Knoxville, Brownlow returned from his continuous speaking tour in the North to set his newspaper up again, and after the war, he moved farther west to become Reconstruction governor in Nashville, where he fought the emergence of the KKK and was vilified on many occasions and on many issues. To this day, his is a hated name in Tennessee.<p>What we value in him and in his writings is his role as a unique lightning rod that stands along on the rooftops attracting the fierce light by which the landscape of antebellum, Civil War, and Reconstruction eras are illuminated for us. <p>Hot-off-the-presses reaction<p>Brownlow published his arrogantly prideful autobiography at age 29, plus several books attacking his foes in realms of religion, and, following <b>Parson Brownlow's Book</b>, his speeches as governor. All contribute to a body of work that is extraordinary for its rhetorical power. Paradoxes and contradictions, sheer venom, and hot-off-the-presses reaction to every manifestation of religion, alcoholism (he championed the Temperance movement), slavery (he defended it, citing religious and other evidence), secession (he opposed it, as a fire-eating Unionist), journalism (every item in his paper was written with personal editorial force), and many other elements are all to be found in <b>Parson Brownlow's Book</b>. <p>Where it is inaccurate, its deliberate distortions express attitudes that we today cannot feel the full force of from any other source. Readers will find Brownlow unique, above all, but as entertaining as he is sometimes thrillingly loathsome. <p>Full of great energy, rhetorical skill, and rambunctiousness, Brownlow follows in the tradition of the tall-tale vernacular writers of that time, such as George Washington Harris, creator of Sut Lovingood, also a native of Knoxville.<p><i>David Madden is founding director of the United States Civil War Center.</i>	Madden, David	Summer 1999	1999-06-01	Review	A Southern Unionist's blustery observations on war, slavery, and the free press	Lightning rod'	Louisiana State University Press					"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=256 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/AshSeceshScoundrels.jpg"">"						
1718	1556523556		The Civil War for Kids: A History with 21 Activities	Civil War for Kids: A History with 21 Activities The	Herbert, Janis			"<p>For children who <i>really</i> want to know what it felt like to take an active role in the past, <b>The Civil War for Kids</b> is <i>it</i>! The cast of characters to choose from is large. Sol-diers, nurses, officers, reporters, artists, doctors, spies, presidents, wives, and children play key roles. These well-known and not-so-known courageous individuals are brought to life through their own words in this activity book.<p>Unlike most books for children that skirt the details or concentrate on just one aspect or on one side of the War, <b>The Civil War for Kids</b> doesn't leave much out. The author, Janis Herbert, takes great pains to tell both sides of a dramatic story and fills the book with archival photographs and illustrations, maps, little-known facts, short biographies, and plenty of activities. To help put all this information in perspective and guide the reader to know even more, she includes a resource section, glossary, timeline, bibliography, and list of officers.<p>Young men and women will find plenty of interest and plenty to do, as suggested by the title of the book. The title, however, is unnecessarily modest, since many adults, especially teachers and librarians, may also appreciate the details and activities contained in this work.<p>Instead of being standard textbook fare, <b>The Civil War for Kids</b> is written simply, with drama, tension, and purpose. The reasons for the War's outbreak and how the War was played out are clearly presented.  Battles are fully described -- with all the anticipation and horror. Herbert puts herself in the midst of the War as she narrates events play-by-play.  Here she ""captures"" the start of Pickett's famous charge:<p>""Then, silence fell. The Rebel artillery, running out of ammunition, wanted to save enough to support their infantry charge. The Union guns, too, became quiet. Pickett, eager to do his part in this battle, looked anxiously for Longstreet to ask permission to advance. General Longstreet, not wishing to send his friend and the men into this desperate charge, couldn't bring himself to speak. He nodded his head in answer to Pickett's request.""<p>The soldier's life is fully described. Although the bulk of the book is devoted to Confederate and Union soldiers on the battlefield, the reader also follows them during drill exercises, in camp waiting for battle, on the march, and in makeshift prisons and hospitals. Herbert stays close to the soldiers to highlight their excitement, determination, frustration, boredom, fear -- even their sense of fun:<p>""Lice were a real annoyance in the camps, but the soldiers found one way to make light of the problem. They would place the lice on plates and hold races to see which one could cross its plate first! One soldier won every time. His friends, suspecting a trick, found out that he got his lice to run faster by heating his plate before the race.""<p><b>The Civil War for Kids</b> also features other witnesses to the War, as well as those who experienced its effects off the battlefield. A chapter devoted to writers, artists, photographers, and reporters spotlights some of the classic literary works, memoirs, and diaries that were written during the War. While Herbert showcases women who served the War as spies, nurses, or even soldiers, she also briefly explains what life at home was like for many women and children. She even includes a short article on what daily life was like for both presidents.<p>Herbert also covers slavery before the War, life in the 54th Massachusetts Regiment, and the roles of Harriet Tubman, Frederick Douglass, and Robert Smalls. She travels with black soldiers who join in the fighting, although little is said about how slaves and free blacks at home were affected by the War and aftermath.<p>One aspect of the book that readers might find disappointing is the limited scope of the activities. Most are not simple, and some will not be inviting. All except for a few involve life on or near the battlefield -- from drill exercises to acting out Antietam to playing general to building a lean-to shelter -- and will be appealing to those caught up in the War's details and strategies. Some of these might work better as classroom exercises because they require several players.<p>Yet the book's strengths far outweigh any shortcomings. <b>The Civil War for Kids</b> introduces the Civil War's well-known stories and characters as well as the little-known facts and unknown players. It is a great way for readers to learn more about the Civil War and to appreciate what history is all about.<p><i>Carolyn P.

2110	842026541		Lessons of War: The Civil War in Children's Magazines	Lessons of War: The Civil War in Children's Magazines	Marten, James			"<b>Lessons of War</b> is a must read for anyone with even the slightest inclination to understand and appreciate our history. Too often, we forget that while the politicians and armies were maneuvering, real battles were a daily part of home-front life. To survive, both mentally and physically, the families left behind worked very hard within and outside the circle of their address. The Civil War was taking place on American soil -- for some, in their back yard. The reality of the conflict could not be put out of mind. The reminders were everywhere.<p>James Marten has honored us with unique research that brings, to one volume, the special, necessary attention given to children by writers and publishers during the years of the war. While reading this logical and complete presentation, the reader is taken by not only the literature presented to the children, but also the reaction and heroics that resulted.<p>The strengths learned and character practiced by children at home was in all areas of our country a foundation for the enormous growth of the United States that followed 1865. <p>The sum and substance of the work can be best described by a soldier's reminder to his son: ""Fate has ordained that we should be actors in this dark chapter of the World's history -- you and I -- Ma' and sister . . . perhaps the little ones -- all are actors -- all have some part to perform.""<p>The children, indeed, had new parts to perform on a stage quite unfamiliar. Their roles were guided by family training, neighbors, their church, and by the publications available to them. The war was not glamourous for either side, and the harsh realities were not hidden from their eyes and developing minds.<p><b>Lessons of War</b> takes the reader on a sound path through subject matter significant to Civil War-era children. We are introduced to the writers and publications of the time. Through these works, we are able to appreciate subjects such as: patriotism; perseverance; loss; sacrifice; relationships with soldiers (be they family, friends, or strangers); mourning; the war effort; and, ultimately, celebrating the end of the conflict. The work is, itself, a celebration and serves as a modern reference.<p>Today's technology has the power to bring all aspects of our country and the world to a personal computer screen. It cannot, however, give us the needed incentive to become involved and, perhaps, inspire our children to react and take a stand. Adult readers of <b>Lessons of War</b> will be amazed.

2220	471183679		A Ruined Land: The End of the Civil War	Ruined Land: The End of the Civil War A	Golay, Michael			"A reviewer should never criticize an author for not writing the book the reviewer would have written on the same subject. A reviewer may point out what he knows to be omissions and misinterpretations, of course, even claim superior knowledge -- but the <i>author</i>'s book is before him, not some other imagined or preferred work. That book and its author deserve the reviewer's best judgment, not the mere substitution of his own ideas.<p>At risk of violating this precept, I confess that <b>A Ruined Land</b> is not the book I expected when I opened it. The fault was in me. I was misled by the title and, not far into the text, by the epigraph to Part Two (from <i>Absalom! Absalom!</i> by William Faulkner): ""It was winter soon and already soldiers were beginning to come back -- the stragglers, not all of them tramps, ruffians, but men who had risked and lost everything, suffered beyond endurance and had returned now to a ruined land, not the same men who had marched away but transformed.""<p>This (and perhaps the memory of Faulkner's masterwork) caused me to jump to the conclusion that I would read about the <i>aftermath</i>, rather than the immediate end of the war, and to anticipate a broadly conceived description of a South laid waste, of grandees reduced to hoeing their own rows, great houses burned, fields idle and overgrown, the remains of a decimated male population struggling to survive in new and unwelcome conditions, and the depredations of carpetbaggers and Ku Kluxers alike. This was a devastated society forced to accept foreign ways and customs, its own having been demolished even as its values largely persisted -- and I expected perhaps a state-by-state survey of the economic and environmental and social destruction war had wrought below Mason's and Dixon's line, description of how victors and vanquished coped, or did not, with entirely novel situations (Negroes camped on, and refusing to move from, former masters' lands); above all, how those who had been masters and slaves reacted to a world turned upside down -- though not entirely.<p><b>An anecdotal, even chatty account</b><p>All or most of this, indeed, is in Michl Golay's superbly researched book, which is confined primarily to 1865 and 1866 with, at the end, a rather abrupt leap forward to 1876. It is not, however, the great overview I expected (an expectation Golay was under no obligation to fulfill; he was writing <i>his</i> book, not mine). Rather, it is an anecdotal, even chatty account (annoyingly sprinkled with first names of persons the reader is expected to recognize even after they have been long absent from the story) of numerous loosely connected events.<p>The book includes, for instance, William Sherman's march through Georgia and the Carolinas; the abortive ""peace"" arranged between Sherman and Joseph E. Johnston (not after Appomattox, but after the last battle of the War in the East, at Bentonville, North Carolina); the assassination of Abraham Lincoln; the Booth manhunt and killing; and the trial and hanging of the other supposed conspirators. (During this discussion we learn a great deal not everyone will want to know about Lew Wallace, later the author of <i>Ben Hur</i> but here one of the judges in the courts-martial of the conspirators, and of Henry Wirz, the commander of the Confederate death camp at Andersonville.) The book also recounts Andrew Johnson's ill-fated ""swing around the circle"" during the elections of 1866; the imprisonment of General Richard Ewell (an interesting but second-rank Confederate); and the Grand Review of Sherman's army along Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington after the guns were stilled.<p>In view of the grab bag nature of Golay's account, it is rather surprising, but welcome, that he dwells only lightly on the flight, capture, and imprisonment of Jefferson Davis -- a story elsewhere told all too often -- and on the impeachment and acquittal of Andrew Johnson, events now familiar to the modern reader owing to the ordeals of Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. Actually, about as much of Golay's story takes place in Washington or the North or in the Union army as in the ruined land of the title.<p>That ruination -- real, terrible, and more enduring than non-Southerners may realize -- is described mostly in the author's chosen anecdotal method, through the stories of numerous defeated and dispossessed but often defiant Southerners -- LeContes, Manigaults, Elliotts, and of course Wade Hampton, without whom no account of ""redemption"" would be acceptable.<p>Golay devotes much attention, in fact, to Hampton's virtual fief -- South Carolina -- which was not only the fire-eating leader of secession among the Confederate states, but also the state that first underwent ""reconstruction"" efforts because the Union conquered its coastal lowlands in the first year of the War. But was South Carolina necessarily more interesting as a war-ruined land than, say, Mississippi or Tennessee? Golay points out, almost in passing, that Georgia was ""redeemed"" (by Democrats, from a so-called ""carpetbag government"") more quickly than was South Carolina, but he does not tell us why or how.<p>After a relatively slow start, <b>A Ruined Land</b> is consistently interesting and usually even-handed, though it is not hard to see that Golay has a more instinctive sympathy for the often-obstreperous freedmen than for those who only reluctantly yielded ownership of slaves (as late as the South Carolina constitutional convention in burned-over Columbia in 1866, with the Confederacy defeated and readmission to the Union at stake, some delegates actively opposed the abolition of slavery!). And it may well be that the sweeping overview of a ""ruined land"" that I expected actually is as familiar a story -- at least to Michl Golay -- as that of Jeff Davis in flight or Andrew Johnson on trial, while the personal and family histories that Golay scatters through his book are fresh and more telling of the Southern experience of defeat than any conventional history.<p>Failure in battle is unique in our history. Defeat in Vietnam was devastating -- but far away and impersonal, except to the relative few who suffered direct loss. In fact, no Americans other than the white Southerners who survived the Civil War suffered military defeat so complete, social upheaval so widespread, economic reversal so disastrous, and environmental destruction so devastating. One of the childhood sights graven in my memory is the ruined stone walls of a factory burned by Sherman's bummers, and I often heard how my grandmother picked up kernels of corn from the ground where a Yankee cavalry horse had dropped them -- her family had nothing else to eat. All Southerners of my generation, and some even younger, have heard and seen such things -- often more horrendous.<p>That is perhaps the primary reason why the South is ""different."" Southerners have known defeat -- if not personally, then in the blood. <b>A Ruined Land</b> -- despite some none-too-relevant divergences and a chronology sometimes difficult to follow, and perhaps because of its focus on individuals and their stories -- lends that fundamental Southern fact the immediacy and reality of endured experience. We can sense, in Michl Golay's telling, the terror and disbelief caused by the burning of Columbia, the weariness, hunger, and despair signaling a lost war and a shattered life, and the helpless anger of people whose values (profound, if wrong-headed) were scorned, and whose true home -- the land of the heart -- was as ruined as their cotton fields.<p><i>Tom G.

Under ""prisoners of war,"" for example, the reader is introduced to the parole papers of a Confederate gunner, the grounds of three prisoner-of-war camps, and the anguished faces of several prison survivors.   <p>While each section is not comprehensive, it does serve as an introduction to the subject. And the illustrations -- over 250 in the entire book -- help to make the subject come alive. The author, John Stanchak, a historical writer and former editor of Civil War Times, painstakingly labels every artifact, photograph, or artwork, and provides the human story behind many of them.

For instance, a compendium of this sort probably ought not to omit all the storm landings (Tarawa, Saipan, Peleliu, Iowa Jima, and the rest) that comprised one of the most striking innovations of World War II. <p>As the greatest battle of the Pacific War, Okinawa makes an obvious subject; but that vast campaign did not include a violently contested amphibious beachhead of the sort that erupted during the 1940s in a manner never seen before nor since. Even in the Okinawa segment, Morelock ignores the amphibious tenor of the Pacific War as reflected in General Buckner's dreadfully costly decision against a mid-campaign landing on the southeastern coast. <p>The book's design is marred by a bizarre choice of cover illustration. The photograph is among the most familiar Civil War images: U.S. Grant and his subordinates lounging on pews in front of Massaponax Church in Spotsylvania County, Virginia, on May 21, 1864. <b>Great Land Battles</b> includes no subjects from 1864, nor any sites within many, many miles of Spotsylvania County. Colonel Morelock doubtless is the latest victim of the fantastic insistence of publishers that authors have no business worrying about the aptness of graphic layout.<p>A reader especially interested in one of the 13 campaigns covered by Morelock will not find much satisfaction in this book. On the other hand, anyone keen on all of them, or in the broad sweep of military matters across the past century and a quarter, will appreciate this graceful summary. <b>Great Land Battles</b> is intended to be synoptic and accessible to the general reader, and it readily succeeds in meeting those goals.<p><i>Robert K.

Thomas explains. ""It contains pictures, contemporary with Lee and with us, of places associated with Lee. It includes pictures of people Lee knew and pictures of Lee. Here is some of the visual record of what history and hucksters have done with Lee."" <p>Thomas's scholarship, found in his earlier work entitled <i>Robert E. Lee: A Biography</i>, has already found its own place in Civil War historical literature and is reflected in this album as well. His offering here is not only a chronological array of period photos, drawings, letters, diary entries, historical objects, and ephemera associated with Lee and his surroundings, but also is an insightful overview of Lee, making him a more recognizable human personality.<p>The <b>Album</b> outlines the major events of Lee's various assignments: first, as a civil engineer whose accomplishments included diverting the waters of the Mississippi to prevent floods; then, as a young and gifted officer in the Federal army who made a mark for himself during the Mexican-American War; next his tenure as superintendent at West Point followed by his efforts to keep the Confederate cause alive, until his final forced surrender at Appomattox. The tale finally concludes with Lee's serving as president of today's Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia.<p>Clearly Thomas's annotated collection of ephemera, the <b>Album</b>  should not be considered the complete album of every known image of, or relating to, Lee. A handsome work, with 156 color and rare black-and-white images, it should lure students of Lee and Civil War buffs alike into visually discovering the world of Virginia's Robert E. Lee. With 135 pages, cast in a pictorial maroon dust jacket and featuring an index, <b>Robert E. Lee: An Album</b> would also serve well as a companion to Thomas's earlier biography of Lee.<p><i>Ronald R.

2105	700609571		The Dominion of Voice: Riot, Reason, & Romance in Antebellum Politics	Dominion of Voice: Riot, Reason, & Romance in Antebellum Politics The	Smith, Kimberly K.			"<b>The Dominion of Voice</b> is an intelligent study in the character of democratic politics before the Civil War, challenging the ideal that reasoned argument is the healthiest means to resolve political conflict. The underlying issue in the book is anti-slavery. Instead of viewing passion as an unhealthy feature of the political landscape, the author contends, we should recognize the enduring role of public protest and the power of sympathy that emerged from slave narratives such as those of the persuasive orator Frederick Douglass.<p>The book is divided into distinct sections that are intriguing in themselves but do not meld well. The first examines the history of mob action in America, categorizing the colonial scene effectively. Street actions were considered a legitimate feature of political discourse, a means of declaring community sentiment without entirely dismantling the system of authority and deference. That is, mobs were neither dismissed as uncivil outbursts, nor simply construed along rigid class lines. In the 19th century, resistance became more disorderly and merely partisan. Rioters targeted the opposition's public ""voice"": printing presses, meeting halls, elections.<p>Neoclassical rhetoric and political oratory is the focus of Kimberly Smith's second section, which highlights the disruptive power of speech. Frances Wright and Angelina Grimk demonstrated the shock value of passionate appeals in furthering the cause of moral reform. Rhetoricians whose definitions mattered -- Hugh Blair and John Quincy Adams -- instructed antebellum orators how they were to make their ideas felt. Speakers were thought to conquer the will through enchanting tones and mannerisms; mesmerism reduced subjects to a pliable state.<p>A final section of the book mingles storytelling with appeals to ""feeling,"" as sympathy trumps reasoned argument. How did people judge the truth or falsehood of abolitionists' claims? Here Frederick Douglass and the fictional Uncle Tom are ultimate examples of sublime storytelling and spiritual strength, who effected a quasi-religious ""conversion"" and made it hard to ""look the other way"" on slavery.<p><b>The Dominion of Voice</b> is a provocative read. Smith at times oversimplifies, for example, too starkly contrasting the orderly features of the 18th century with the violence of the 19th century. The common thread in this interesting if uneven effort to categorize the historical nature of open resistance is the importance of the arousal of passions to achieve political ends. Reason, the author insists, is the rhetorical (but not the real American) solution to the central issues in history. Traditional mobs were closer to rallies and parades than most historians credit, and the spirit underlying vocal abolitionism, while considered ""inflammatory"" by antebellum Southerners, possessed positive value in legitimating the slave narrative and a distinctly American power in championing the rights of all.<p><i>Andrew Burstein is author of </i>Sentimental Democracy: The Evolution of America's Romantic Self-Image<i> (1999) and </i>The Inner Jefferson: Portrait of a Grieving Optimist<i> (1995).</i>"	Burstein, Andrew	Winter 2000	1999-12-01	Review	Mob rhetoric as an antebellum political device	The arousal of passions	University Press of Kansas					"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=244 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/KimberlySmithTheDominionofVoice.jpg"">"						
2090	898799228		Everyday Life During the Civil War: A Guide for Writers, Students, and Historians		Varhola, Michael J.			"<b>Everyday Life During the Civil War</b> is one of a series of guides published by Writer's Digest Books as a resource primarily for writers of fiction. The book consists of 10 chapters and four appendices that include such topics as wages, currency, food, games, language, technology, and arms and equipment. Additionally, there are several glossaries and lists of various goods and services along with their cost year by year.<p>Michl J. Varhola writes in the preface to his book that ""it is intended to be a broad-based introduction to the day-to-day conditions, attitudes, and events of the period."" For the most part, it meets this goal. As a resource for the fiction writer or for the educator, it provides an excellent source of information about subjects often referred to in Civil War literature without explanation. A description of the states and territories that existed at the time, the organizational structure of the respective armies, rural versus urban life, and how people entertained themselves are examples of well-covered subjects. <p>There are important areas, however, which only are touched upon lightly or are missing altogether, such as law enforcement, the treatment of civil liberties, the courts, and military justice -- all important in everyday life. Religion is another subject that is absent from the book. The assassination of President Lincoln and its aftermath are also missing except for a few sentences that contain errors.<p>There are other errors, albeit many are of a minor nature. For instance: in 1860, the United States flag had 33 stars, not 34 (Kansas was admitted in January 1861); the daguerreotype was invented in 1839, not 1837; John Wilkes Booth was killed on April 26, not April 25; Lincoln and Johnson were the nominees of the ""National Union Party"" in 1864, a coalition party of Republicans and War Democrats (a very significant point that should be explained); and, according to the 1860 census, there were 3,953,587 slaves, not three million. If the book is to be a resource of factual information, such errors are troublesome.<p>These shortcomings, however, are more than overcome by the overall value of <b>Everyday Life in the Civil War</b> as a useful resource for filling in much of the background information and detail about the subjects it does cover.<p><i>Edward Steers, Jr. is author of </i>His Name Is Still Mudd<i> and </i>Lincoln: A Pictorial History<i>.

1959	873386388		Ten Months in the 'Orphan Brigade': Conrad Wise Chapman's Civil War Memoir	Ten Months in the 'Orphan Brigade': Conrad Wise Chapman's Civil War Memoir	Bassham, Ben L.			"A wartime memoir by Conrad Wise Chapman, the most important soldier-artist of the Confederacy, represents a potential bounty for historians. Unfortunately, the memoir covers only one year and does not include Chapman's service in Virginia or in South Carolina, where hedocumented with paintings Charleston's harbor defenses. Kent State University art history professor Ben Bassham asserts in his introduction that Chapman's memoirs deserve publication because they are ""such a good read"" and ""make for a powerful and unforgettable picture of the war drawn by a young man with an eye for detail.""<p>Opinions will differ over whether the partial memoir makes for a good read, but no one can contest that it provides an invaluable window into the unique perspective of one Southern soldier. ""My character was formed in the armies of the south,"" Chapman wrote in the memoir,  ""and for better or worse I must abide by it."" Though born in Virginia, Chapman was at first an outsider among his comrades-in-arms. Known as ""Old Rome"" for his adopted home in Italy, Chapman aroused curiosity and suspicion. When he arrived in ""neutral"" Kentucky to join the Confederate army, an officer in his regiment (3rd Kentucky Infantry) even accused him of being a spy. The subsequent 10 months in the Orphan Brigade were not exactly rife with the events that  customarily make for an exciting memoir. Sick in the hospital during February and March 1862, Chapman rejoined his unit in time to be wounded on the second day at Shiloh. The memoir ends abruptly in June 1862 with Chapman's unit on the march in northern Mississippi.<p>Written from memory more than three years after Chapman returned home to Rome on furlough, the memoir is most notable as the expression of the faith and passions of a young man who went out of his way to join a cause from which he could have remained aloof. ""We who are left, have a sacred duty to perform,"" Chapman interjected in his account of November 1861, ""that is to keep [those who died] in remembrance and the wrongs to avenge which they died for, to be worthy of them.""<p>The passage reveals not only Chapman's ideology, but also his often convoluted punctuation and grammar. Consistent with modern editing standards, Bassham presents Chapman's words without alteration and minimal annotation. On a few occasions, the prose is dense enough to lose the reader. The chronological and stylistic shortcomings of Chapman's memoir and its brevity and paucity of illustrations make it more a pamphlet than a book. The original manuscript of the memoir is in a private collection and, regardless of shortcomings, this book is a welcome contribution. Bassham himself proves the value of the source in his lavish and definitive biography, <i>Conrad Wise Chapman: Artist and Soldier of the Confederacy</i> (Kent State University Press, 1999). <p><i>John M.

Gordon B. McKinney, Phillip S. Paludan, Altina L. Waller, John C. Inscoe, Kenneth W. Noe, Noel C. Fisher, and others have begun to challenge longstanding myths about modernization, politics, sectionalism, slavery, unionism, and warfare among the isolated, rugged mountain folk. Rejecting stereotypes, they identify class, community, county, and region as factors that explain why and how mountaineers chose to support the Confederacy, the Union, or neither side during the Civil War.<p>As Paludan has written, in the Southern Highlands ""an allegiance was worn as a target over the heart, amid armed enemies, and loyalty could attract both dangerous friends and mortal enemies."" Noe and Shannon H. Wilson have remarked that ""[t]he valleys of Appalachia acted as a crucible where Unionism and sentiments in favor of secession mixed to create an explosive reaction."" Books by W. Todd Groce and Sean Michl O'Brien support this argument. Though both books are flawed, they nevertheless serve up a wealth of new detail, underscore the diversity of Southern Appalachia's Civil War history, and make useful contributions to the ""new"" historiography of the mountain region.<p>Whereas previous writers have concentrated on mountain unionists and their determined efforts to squelch the Confederate war effort, in <b>Mountain Rebels</b> Groce seeks to rescue Tennessee's secessionists from oblivion. When writing about the War, he explains, historians either have ignored East Tennessee Confederates ""or viewed them as shadowy characters operating on the fringe, rather than at the center, of events. They have assumed...that these rebels were little different from other rebels across the South, and thus they have dismissed them as unimportant or labeled them a mere aberration...."" Groce, in contrast, interprets East Tennesseans as reluctant and exceptional Confederates. Relying heavily on the voices of participants, he tells a heartfelt story of defeat, suffering, and banishment of the ""large, vocal, and determined Confederate minority"" in Tennessee's mountains in 1861.<p>Unlike other Confederates, rebels in East Tennessee fought a three-front war. They confronted Federal invaders, Jefferson Davis's unfriendly administration in Richmond, and an antagonistic Union majority in their own backyard. What led them to don Confederate gray? According to Groce, the mountain rebels had long-established antebellum economic, cultural, and familial ties with the Deep South, relations they feared (with much prescience) would be disrupted by northern invasion. East Tennessee secessionists tended to be younger, Democratic, prosperous, and oriented more toward commerce and finance than their unionist (and former Whig) opponents.<p>Unfortunately Groce fails to develop fully his economic argument and, as a result, readers will want to know more about the motivations and loyalties of the East Tennessee secessionists. Apparently despite their saber rattling, they were ambivalent Confederates from the start and, not surprisingly, their zeal for the cause waned rapidly as military defeats escalated. Groce also devotes inadequate attention to East Tennesseans' service with Confederate forces. He admits that they performed poorly as soldiers but, clearly sympathizing with the Tennesseans, insists that Jefferson Davis's government (especially General Edmund Kirby Smith) distrusted and abandoned them. Fearful of their disloyalty, the Confederate high command dispatched the mountain rebels to fight in Mississippi while their families were exposed to constant attacks from unionist guerrillas and draft dodgers. When, by 1864, East Tennessee fell to the Federals, its rebels were subjected to savage and bitter attacks by local unionists. Retribution bred dislocation, legal persecution, social chaos, and widespread violence that persisted well into the 1870s.<p><b>Paramilitary guerrilla warfare and extralegal vigilantism</b><p>In <b>Mountain Partisans</b> Sean Michl O'Brien examines an earlier phase of that violence, the paramilitary guerrilla warfare and extralegal vigilantism that engulfed Southern Appalachia throughout the Civil War. Secessionists and unionists both conducted irregular operations that left bitter hatreds in their wake. These animosities simmered long after War's end, leading Appalachian scholars to debate the Civil War's long-term impact on such questions as the timing of the mountain region's modernization, its reputation for political conservatism, and its alleged penchant for family feuds and violence.<p>Though regular Confederate and Union army regiments served in the southern mountains, guerrilla warfare was conducted largely by irregulars -- Home Guards, Partisan Rangers, and independent units, often called ""bushwhackers."" Home Guards, organized on the county level, were responsible for rounding up deserters and draft dodgers, protecting communities from resident unionists and Federal troops, and confiscating animals and supplies for the Confederacy. According to O'Brien, ""It was not unusual for Home Guards to be neighbors and personal enemies of the deserters they were hunting. They used their authority to conduct personal vendettas arising from feuds over land, property, and livestock, and robbed and harassed the defenseless women and children left at home.""<p>Partisan Rangers, authorized by an act of the Confederate Congress in April 1862, conducted lightning fast raids, captured prisoners, destroyed enemy war matriel, and often succumbed to the lure of plunder. ""Bushwhackers,"" answerable to no central authority, wreaked the most havoc on civilians on both sides. ""Often,"" O'Brien concludes, ""they were little more than outlaws, who took advantage of the chaos of wartime to rob, pillage, and murder.""<p>Drawing largely on recently published scholarship rather than original sources, O'Brien divides the mountain South into five parts (Western North Carolina, East Tennessee, North Alabama, North Georgia, and West Virginia) and describes the culture of guerrilla fighting there state by state. ""It was a dirty, secret little war,"" he writes, ""where small groups of nameless bushwhackers struck at each other without warning, savagely. Where death often came suddenly from the silence of the wooded mountain slopes. Where the hangman's rope and the raider's torch were liberally applied. Where the real heroes were women and small children left at home, vulnerable to attack by marauders who struck without conscience or ethic.""<p>The strength of O'Brien's book is the arsenal of case studies he assembles to document the many uncivil wars that raged in Civil War Appalachia. In January 1863, for example, 13 unionists suspected of guerrilla activity were executed in a brutal fashion by Confederates at Shelton Laurel, in the western North Carolina mountains. In November 1864, Federals torched the North Georgia town of Canton in retaliation for raids by pro-Confederate guerrillas. Thomas M. Clark, a rebel deserter, and his band, the ""Buggers,"" preyed on both Confederates and unionists throughout North Alabama. Two weeks after Appomattox, Clark and his gang continued to rob, torture, and murder defenseless citizens in Lauderdale County. O'Brien catalogs a long list of assaults, atrocities, bridge burnings, killings, tortures, and all manner of wanton destruction by both sides throughout the Southern Appalachian region.<p>Though he has compiled many colorful accounts of mountain murder and mayhem, O'Brien's book unfortunately adds up to less than a complete whole. Packed with unconnected and undigested examples of guerrilla violence arranged geographically, <b>Mountain Partisans</b> bursts from the seams with details but lacks both a coherent structure and enough context to explain their significance. O'Brien generally ignores local differences, thereby rendering communities caught in the throes of internecine struggle homogeneous, lifeless, and uninteresting.<p>Despite their deficiencies, these two books nonetheless add to our understanding of the Civil War in the Highlands. Scholars and general readers, however, must wait for broader and more thorough analyses. Mountain folk who lived and labored in the hills and hollows of Southern Appalachia had complex identities. They were more complicated than the stereotypes depicting them as feuding hillbillies or passive victims suggest.

Other works I have recommended for reprint that I can now recommend here are: Robert Penn Warren's novel <i>Wilderness</i> (University of Tennessee Press); Fletcher Pratt's <i>Short History of the Civil War</i> (Dover); <i>Coat of Blue, Coat of Gray</i> (Pelican), a novel for children; and <i>The Wave</i>, a novel by Evelyn Scott (University Press of Virginia).<p>I will never, I hope, need to advocate reprinting the <i>Personal Memoirs of U.S. Grant </i>(Modern Library, $15.95, ISBN 0375752285). Watkins's beloved memoir (in print since 1962, at least) would need no advocate either, were it not for M. Thomas Inge's detective work, which turned up six published, forgotten, and uncollected articles by Watkins which cannot be found in the few other editions in print. These articles and the other major embellishments Inge has included in this new edition -- an introduction, a textual note, a chronology, ""A Concise History of the First Tennessee Infantry Regiment,"" a glossary, a topical index, a geographic index, and a biographical directory and index -- offered stellar competition against the existing editions and more than enough justification for my urging Plume to publish it and for my choosing to recommend it here.<p>Sam Watkins was only 41 when he started publishing installments of his memoirs in his hometown newspaper in Columbia, Tennessee, in 1881. His memory was sharp and so was his tongue. The more he tells about his experiences as a lowly private in the side show of the big show, the more disgusted we become with the officers' performances in the big tent (""a fitting burlesque to tragic scenes""). The show business metaphor is only one of an arsenal of rhetorical devices Watkins employs. In recounting 150 distinct episodes, from Shiloh, Corinth, Perryville, Knoxville, Murfreesboro, Chickamauga, Missionary Ridge, the Hundred Days Battles, Resaca, Atlanta, Franklin, and Nashville to war's end -- a fast-paced tour of major battles in both the Western and the Eastern campaigns -- Watkins moves with convincing ease from satire to pathos, from invective to laudation, from ridicule to compassion, from sarcasm to lyricism, from near-farce to black humor, from acid anecdote to trenchant generalization, from gory image to rhapsodic flights, and from excoriation of political and religious orators to exhortations of Divine Justice.<p>Watkins's prose is a veritable repository of rhetorical devices, from literary allusions to salty sayings to satirical punning. Have a sample or two: ""Keep up that feint movement until all the boys faint from sheer exhaustion."" ""We found the guard,"" eleven men, ""hard frozen as the icicles that hung from their hands and faces and clothing."" Readers may be reminded of Twain's Southwestern tall tales, of Bierce's bizarre incidents, and of the picaresque novels of Fielding and Defoe. A master of Southern oral storyteller's style and Victorian literary style, Watkins meshes both.<p>To test one's ability to resist such richness, one might stand and read in a bookstore such brief episodes as ""A Night Among the Dead,"" ""Ten Men Killed at the Mourners' Bench,"" and ""The Death of Tom Tuck's Rooster."" Not to mention ""Eating Rats.""<p>Too many memoirists seem passive witnesses. Watkins is an active participant. Getting wounded, being captured, escaping, and then almost drowning on a sinking steamboat are only a few of his misadventures. Need I mention that he has a girl at home and more than one away from home? He does things he is ashamed to admit. But he is unflinchingly honest about the catch-22 insanity of the military system in that ""long and unholy and uncalled for war"": ""I shrink from butchery."" But about the execution of a deserter, who asks to drink rain water from his grave and who curses everybody and everything, Watkins say, flatly, ""I felt he deserved to die."" <p>With his many references to then and now and his shifts from past to present tense, Watkins creates a sense of several time dimensions existing simultaneously. ""Whit thought he was killed, but he is living yet."" The sense of painful immediacy the reader may feel derives partly from Watkins's compulsion to talk directly to his fellow veterans and to all who were not. ""Farewell, friend: we will meet over yonder,"" he writes to his dead comrade. ""Reader mine, did you live in that stormy period?"" He makes repeated allusions to the act of writing: ""I lay down my pen; I can write no more; my heart is too full. This is the saddest chapter I ever wrote."" And to the act of reading: ""as you are now reading these lines.""<p>He often compares himself and other common soldiers with The Generals. ""The generals risked their reputations, the private soldier his life."" With bitter irony, he declares: ""I shot only at privates."" He often compares himself, as a small town newspaper memoirist, with historians. ""I know nothing of the battle. See the histories for that. I only write from memory."" But his experiences will seem to most readers far richer than that of the generals, maybe even Grant and Lee included. As for the historians, for over a century few have failed to draw, when appropriate -- and it often is -- on his testimony. <p>""I only tell what I saw,"" he admits, making no claim to historic fact. But the overriding fact is that what he didn't see or hear or know, what he misperceived, what he imagined, and, above all, the extraordinary power of the words he chose to express -- all that -- was as much a part of the history as any congeries of facts. A Bayeux tapestry of the Civil War would be woven of facts and figments, just as every history book is.<p>The only thing better than the Watkins millions have loved is more of the same, those six unknown articles and those enhancements with which Professor Inge has blessed us.<p><i>The United States Civil War Center grew out of David Madden's research for his Civil War novel</i> Sharpshooter. <i>The Center's founding director, Madden recently resigned that position to devote more time to a new novel set on ancient London Bridge during civil war, plague, and fire.</i><p>An abridged version of this column appears in the Fall 1999 print edition of <b>Civil War Book Review.</b>"	Madden, David	Fall 1999	1999-09-01	Classics		Rediscovering Civil War Classics	Plume/Penguin-Putnam					"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=245 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/WatkinsCompanyAytch.jpg"">"

1282			INTERVIEW:<p>Tribes and Tribulations: Barbara Cloud explores issues of family and war		Ng, Laura			"<p><b><i>Civil War Book Review (cwbr): You mention in the introduction of Minister to the Cherokees that you are a descendant of James Anderson Slover. How does your relationship to Slover affect this project?</i></b><p> <b>Barbara Cloud (bc):</b> The main impact is that it gave me access to the primary documents without leaving home. I never met the man or heard anyone talk about what he was like. He was just ""Grandpa Slover"" to my father. Actually he is my father's great-grandfather.<p><b><i> cwbr: What motivated him to write his memoirs?</i></b> <p><b>bc:</b> His children begged him to write the story of his life. He undoubtedly had told them about his adventures and they, like I, thought them interesting enough to be recorded. I do not think Slover intended them for an audience beyond his own family. Interestingly, my own father was moved by Slover's memoir to write his own.<p><b><i> cwbr: Slover does not reveal a great deal about his family life. Is this typical for war memoirs?</i></b> <p><b>bc:</b> I cannot speak for war memoirs in particular, but I think his approach is typical of 19th-century men writing about their lives-maybe 20th-century men as well because my father's memoir does not say much about family either. I suspect this relates to the public/private life issue that has often been raised about the respective roles of men and women. I have tried to persuade my mother to write her memoir so that I could place it next to my father's- I think she would include very different events and much more about family.<p><b><i> cwbr: What impact, according to Slover, did the Civil War have on the Cherokee nation? What issues besides slavery drove the division among the Cherokee? Do they mirror the larger crisis between North and South?</i></b><p><b> bc:</b> The Cherokees had been split since the Treaty of New Echota, when part of the nation was willing to give up ancestral lands in Georgia and North Carolina to the U.S., but others were not and objected. They were already divided between the so-called full bloods and half bloods before slavery aggravated the division and the nation became involved in the Civil War.<p><b><i> cwbr: Slover briefly served as a chaplain for a Confederate Cherokee regiment. What was his experience? How did this affect his views regarding separation of religion and politics? How do his views on separation match the sentiments of other faiths during this time?</i></b> <p><b>bc:</b> He says almost nothing about the period in which he was a chaplain, so I can only speculate about his experience. I would love to know why it was so short, since he apparently replaced a colleague who was willing to be a courier for General Stand Watie; it may be that Slover was asked to do something similar and refused. I suspect his insistence on separating religion and the politics of slavery was his way to avoid confronting the issue of slavery. Most of the other missionaries working among the Cherokees were anti-slavery. The northern Baptists Evan Jones and his son had a great deal of influence among the Cherokee leadership and noted that they had hoped Slover would work with them in converting the nation. Instead, when they found he was not anti-slavery, they spread rumors about him-or so he says.<p> <b><i>cwbr: Is there a single moment that sticks out in your mind as exemplifying the Cherokee experience during the Civil War?</i></b><p><b> bc:</b> The thing that stands out in my mind as exemplifying the experience during the Civil War-and afterward-is the raiding and marauding that went on, sometimes from the Union side, sometimes from the Confederates. People living in the area, whether they were Cherokees or whites, were not safe from theft or worse. In one of the few times he talks about how his family shared his experiences, Slover tells how they hid their food from the raiders and how they had to make clothing from the curtains. I suspect such experiences were worse for the Cherokees whose nation was nearly destroyed during the war.<p><b><i> cwbr: How powerful a tool was religion when it came to recruiting for the North and the South?</i></b><p><b> bc:</b> The missionaries took sides in the war, mainly based on the slavery issue that had already split the Cherokee nation. There is nothing to suggest that Slover helped recruit people to fight for the South, so I think recruiting success resulted more from the personalities of the leaders on each side. Both Chief John Ross, who was eventually on the side of the North, and Stand Watie, a Confederate, had their own followings separate from religious issues.<p><b><i> cwbr: You comment in the Minister to the Cherokees that individuals from Tennessee, due to its promotion of ""democracy, autonomy, giving frontiersmen an opportunity to participate actively in their own salvation, embraced the Baptist faith."" Do these same principles attract the members of the Cherokee Nation, or were there different qualities that appealed to them?</i></b><p><b>bc:</b> Slover makes it sound as though the respective success of the northern and southern Baptists among the Cherokees came primarily from their stands on slavery. Slover labored quite some time as a missionary in the Cherokee nation before he made any converts, and by then, 1858-59, war was near. Because of the strictness of a few of the other missionaries, some of Slover's conversion success may have come from the problems certain Cherokees had keeping employment if they did not disavow slavery. The southern Baptists ""converted"" a number of the Cherokee preachers who had previously joined other faiths but were dismissed because of their acceptance of slavery.<p><i>Barbara Cloud is the associate provost for academic affairs at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas.

1345			EDITORIAL:<p>Skill and balance		Ng, Laura			<br>When I was in the third grade one of my friends convinced me that learning to walk with a book balanced on my head would be a valuable life skill and social asset. My friend was right. Contradictions permeate most aspects of life, and it is by aiming for balance that we reconcile them to ourselves, as is the case with this issue. We present works on virtue and infamy, battlefields and home fronts, as well as flesh-and-blood men and the legends that have grown up around them.<p> Harold Holzer leads the procession of principles with his review of <b>Lincoln's Virtues: An Ethical Biography</b> (Alfred A.

Contrasting this is Lonnie Speer's exploration of the darker side of war with his review of <b>Elmira: Death Camp of the North</b> (Stackpole, ISBN 0811714322, $26.95, hardcover). Together these pieces reveal both the triumphs and failings that mark us as wonderfully and painfully human. <p>And what is more human than conflict? James M.

Rable's <b>Fredericksburg! Fredericksburg!</b> (University of North Carolina Press, ISBN 0807826731, $45.00, hardcover). From the fire and smoke of contested ground, we turn to the warm glow of the hearth. Herman Hattaway reminds us that conflict was not limited to political realms and battlefields in his review of <b>Union Soldiers and the Northern Home Front: Wartime Experiences, Postwar Adjustments</b> (Fordham University Press, ISBN 0823221466, $25.00, softcover).

2362	253340810	$29.95	Somebody's Darling: Essays on the Civil War		Gramm, Kent			<br>Few of the writers have done so well at asking the truly hard questions about the Civil War as has Kent Gramm, whose compelling <b>Somebody's Darling: Essays on the Civil War</b> approaches the masterful achievement of Robert Penn Warren's <i>The Legacy Civil War</i> as a meditation on what the War meantùand still meansùin the collective American psyche and soul. <p>Gramm, whose degrees include a Master of Divinity from Princeton, does not flinch from questioning God's ways to man. Gramm often carries on a Melville-like quarrel with God over the essential question of Why? He also questions our own motivesùthose of us who, frankly, love the war. To understand the Civil War intellectually is one thing; it is a theoretical, political, moral, abstract thing. But to experience what it was like is another thing. He considers the nearly incomprehensible prominence of the war on our cultural landscape, yet he focuses on the war's impact on individual lives. The Civil War is not merely the sum of events; rather, it is a moral phenomenonùa product of human agency with moral consequences. <p>Gramm's post-Edenic vision attempts both to find meaning in the war and to refute the myths and self-congratulatory platitudes with which we comfort ourselves. He challenges even the cherished belief that the Civil War was divinely ordained and therefore a cleansing spiritual surgery. Questioning the theodicy of the war, he paraphrases William Blake in asking, What hand and what art dare frame war's fearful symmetry? Gramm proposes that the Civil War had its heroes, but heroes are not men on battlefields, they are written thingsùthat heroism and the nobility of warriors are rhetorical constructs. <p>Gramm also considers cultural phenomena such as battle reenactments, films, and other commodifications of history. Some-body's Darling, which provides the book's title, critically evaluates the film Gettysburg and how it has shaped our views of the war, mostly for ill. From the diminishing that Lee's character suffers in Martin Sheen's hands to the overfed and middle-aged reenactor extras, Gramm spares few of the film's incongruities. He wonders at the absence of gore to show graphically what really happened. In spite of his assessment that what the movie lacks in realism, it makes up for in error, Gramm relates a young student's first experience with the film, who is touched with grief at the genuine human pathosùsomething that we scholars have forgotten how to do. <p>Further, Gramm cites part of the <i>Bhaga-vad-Gita,</i> essentially a war tale. Lord Krishna surveys the battle scene; sickened by the thought of killing his kinsmen, his fellow humans, he lays down his arms. Arguing that the<i> Gita</i> both glorifies and repudiates war, Gramm, in The Song of God, explores the paradox of why we love to reenact, review, and otherwise commemorate an event that horrifies us. Why stage the morbid celebration of battle reenactments, much like the ancient Greek funeral games? Why is the imaginative appeal of the war is so strong? The concluding thought in Witnesses, as in many of these essays, is an uncomfortable one: that in our zeal to study the war and revel in its drama and sweep, we imbue it with nostalgia, dignity, a terrible beautyùand forget that the battlefield was a slaughter, and that the dead Rebel in the Sunken Road was Somebody's Darling. <p>In The Gettysburg that Nobody Knows, Gramm points out that the historically verifiable facts of the battle bring us knowledge, but no wisdom. The personal value of an individual soldier's life is what is relevant if we are to attain unto human knowledge and understanding. Indeed, Gramm gently chides history for its inability to delve into the weightier matters of the law: Fate, Mercy, Compassion, Grief, Life after Death, and whether God is really in His heaven after all. We do not understand the sacrament of our own blood . . . nor do we know whether believing in its significance is faith or delusion. <p>Wilderness is one of the book's cornerstones and offers the Wilderness battles as metaphorùeven allegoryùfor the chaotic nature of war and for the elusiveness of epistemological certitude: that the clearings in the forestùa succession of relatively clean, well-lighted placesùpunctuate the impenetrable woods like a stuttered sentence through the sunless confusion. These clearings gave the troops in them a false sense of clarity and orientation . . . but they were isolated, and they were at the mercy of whatever happened in the tangles left and right of them. Thus it is with conventional history. We can only construe from what we see. He cites Heisenberg and the uncertainty principle and the impossibility of predicting events. The Wilderness demands humility; in it, the mighty can be weak and the audacious set to naught. <p>The Real War and Nothing but Omnipotence both further explore the problem of history and narrative and how, in Walt Whitman's words, the real war will never get in the books. This is not to say that historians are foolsùonly that the limits of traditional scholarship cannot explain the intricacies of the human heart. Also, the facts about the war and what it means change with each generation of historians. <p>If it exists at all today, the real Civil War exists in imaginations. Whatever connects America's waking dream, its nightmare of the 1860s, and usùthat is our means of get-ting some stray glimpses of that war. The means are song and story, images, strange things, dreamlike things, things to lead us now and then to nightmare. <p>The Road to Gettysburg, a long poem, echoes many themes from the essays, including the deception of cultural tradition: <br>Both armies sought the felon dignity <br>of triumph as they passed along their ways, <br>for killers masquerade in history <br>as saints, and poets lie because a lie<br> is prettier than death. . . . <p>The poem is reminiscent of Whitman, Owen, and especially Tate's Ode to the Confederate Dead, in its poignant contemplations of war's sacrifice, whether it came to aught, and what we all may have lost as a result. <p>His Epilogue: <i>Les Terribles</i> honors a neighbor and friend, a World War II veteran named Dick Benson. Gramm speculates on the paradox of fundamentally decent menùas American troops usually seemed to beùwho could take part in an indecent task and yet struggle the rest of their lives to bear the burden. But this is a distinctly positive note to end onùthat the goodness in the hearts of men may outlast the horrors that they sometimes are compelled to witness. <p>Gramm's writing weaves in influences from Shakespeare to Yeats and from Thoreau to Hemingway, enriching his prose with multi-layered depth. His fluency with the abstract does not save him from occasional obscurity, however. There is a Zen-like approach to structure that can leave the reader wandering. Linking image and idea together with an almost metaphysical facility, however, Gramm treats his subject with humor and verve as well as awe and piety. <p>This collection is a must-read for anyone who ever cared about the Civil War and its significance in the life of the human mind and spirit. It will beùor ought to beùone of the indispensable classics in this field. <p>Gramm does not pretend to have all of the answers, or even to know how to get them. But he has, with eloquence and incisive power, identified the most crucial and urgent questions. <p><i>Randal Allred is associate professor in the Department of English at Brigham Young University-Hawaii, where he also directs the Honors Program.

"<p align=""left""><a name=""Top""></a>Just         the Facts?    <p align=""left"">Historians         and novelists discuss the relationship between history and fiction<br>        <br>        Very few phrases can make an historian flinch like ""artistic license.""         Likewise, even a writer of the highest ability may occasionally balk under         the strain of history's unyielding web of facts. It would appear that         the battle line is drawn, and ""all that is left is the staring.""         But it is not silence that marks the relationship between historian and         novelist; rather, as Mark C. Carnes's <i>Novel History</i> shows, this         delicate balance is one of discussion, discovery, and creativity focused         on the question, ""What should the link between history and fiction         entail?""<br>        <br>        Using Carnes's work as a stepping-stone, we have invited two historians         and two novelists to give their opinion on the subject. Distinguished         historian Herman Hattaway, honored novelist Josephine Humphreys, cutting-edge         historian Louis Masur, and award-winning novelist David Madden, have graciously         agreed to share their time and opinions with us. What follows is a fascinating         exploration of the power of history in fiction, and the power of fiction         in history.<br>        <br>        -Laura Ng, Editor <br>        <br>             <hr align=center>      <p><a href=""#Hattaway"">Herman         Hattaway</a><br>        <a href=""#Humphreys"">Josephine Humphreys</a><br>        <a href=""#Masur"">Louis P. Masur</a><br>        <a href=""#Madden"">David Madden</a><br><br>        <a name=""Hattaway""></a><br>        Many of the numerous contributors to this wonderful, intriguing, and captivating         book assert that all novels are historical novels. Ah, but there are good         historical novels and bad historical novels. True: there also is good         history and bad history, but I suspect there is considerably more bad         fiction.<br>        <br>        Many people are going to read historical novels, whether we historians         like it or not. That is why I chose to include selections of what I regarded         as ""good"" novels in my admittedly idiosyncratic annotated bibliography         in<i> Shades of Blue and Gray </i>(Harvest Books, ISBN 0156005905, $16.00         softcover).<br>        <br>        What really is egregious about bad fiction is for the author to put blatantly         wrong data into the work. I offer as examples two popular movies based         on historical fiction: <i>Shakespeare in Love</i> and <i>Elizabeth</i>.         In the former, Queen Elizabeth is aged but still quite alive, and Gwyneth         Paltrow's character cannot marry her lover, Shakespeare, because her father         is sending her off to marry a tobacco plantation owner in Virginia. Hello?         Elizabeth died in 1603 and Virginia was not founded until 1607. Meanwhile,         nothing was said about the fact that Shakespeare was already married!         In the latter movie, the young Elizabeth, contrary to her better judgment,         sends a military expedition against forces loyal to Mary, Queen of Scots.         The movie shows much carnage and implies that the venture was a horrible         mistake for Elizabeth. But in fact the English were victorious in that         campaign!<br>        <br>        Both the good historical novelist and the good historian attempt to approach         truth through probability. Both at times have to take interpolative leaps         of faith. So the two do similar things, but they do it in starkly different         ways. The novelist is free to embellish or create much additional material         beyond that which is revealed in the evidential records-passages quite         simply can just be made up out of the writer's imagination. The historian         is <i>not</i> supposed to do that. The historian posits conclusions based         on probable reality as suggested by available facts.<br>        <b>        Point/counterpoint in five parts</b><br>        <br>        <i>Novel History</i> has five parts: Biography, The West, Slavery, Religion         and American Culture, and War. There are learned critical essays by historians,         each assessing one notable historical novel. Then, where possible, the         novelist presents a response. <br>        <br>        One of the most intriguing among the many thought-provoking passages throughout         the book is Joan D. Hendrick's observation that the year before Harriet         Beecher Stowe completed <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin </i>(Dutton, ISBN 0451526708,         $5.95 softcover), she helped her brother Charles write a fictionalized         biography of Christ. <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i> is an artful retelling of         Christ's story through the character of Tom. Hence, in this particular         tradition of the historical novel, religion is interlaced with nationalism,         and the hero is freely given godlike qualities.<br>        <br>        Eugene D. Genovese begins by pointing out that there is no profit in rehashing         the endless assertions that William Styron in <i>The Confessions of Nat         Turner</i> (Vintage Books, ISBN 0679736638, $14.00 softcover) falsified         history. Of course he did! But he has ennobled Nat Turner, giving him         qualities that he <i>may</i> have possessed, although the historical records         do not say. Genovese opines that Styron's passionate art did indeed lead         him to the heart of historical truth.<br>        <br>        Tom Wicker's essay on <i>Cold Mountain</i> (Vintage Books, ISBN 0375700757,         $14.00 softcover) is a gem. This book transcends its specific subject         matter, the Civil War experiences of one particular man, and becomes a         meditation on any war in any time-and what it does to the soldiers and         their society. Charles Frazier thus offers material that can be equated         with the works of Ernest Hemingway, Erich Maria Remarque, Tim O'Brien,         and Tolstoy. Perhaps Frazier's keenest accomplishment is to convey a deep         sense of how things were at the time about which he was writing; the reader         gets to see and feel the moments. We are reassured that life goes on despite         all sorts of unhappiness and tragedy, and there is a kaleidoscopic matrix         of wondrous co-realities.<br>        <br>        -Herman Hattaway<br>        <br>        <i>Herman Hattaway is a much-published historian of the Civil War.

""Novels,""       I said. He nodded, then asked the tougher question: ""Fiction novels       or true novels?""<br>      I thought of explaining that all novels are fiction but at the same time       fiction is truth on a deeper level, etc. But I just said, ""Fiction       novels,"" because I was gearing up at that moment to write a true novel,       after three fiction ones, and I was exhilarated by the difference. It was       a strange feeling, a thrill almost embarrassing, to be closing in on Truth.       The thrill was undiminished by the fact that I didn't know how to do it.       <br>      <br>      Mark Carnes's book would have been a big help to me. My novel was to be       about a woman living through hard times in North Carolina during and after       the Civil War. She was a Lumbee Indian, married to an outlaw. Her world       was so far from mine, I would have to learn it from scratch. Problems would       stump me every day. How much research was needed? Could I alter facts? How       would I find the right sound for the narrative language? Who was I anyway,       to tell what most historians had glossed over? And-most worrisome to me-was       it okay for me as a white writer to speak in the voice of the Indian woman?       Novel History could have saved me a lot of fretting.<br>      <br>      It would have helped, for instance, to learn of John Updike's simple formula       for allotting research time, while he was working on<i> Memories of the       Ford Administration </i>(Ballatine Books, ISBN 0449912116, $14.00, softcover).       How did he know when to quit researching and start writing? ""When I       thought I knew enough,"" Updike says. <br>      <br>      As for the question of cultural expropriation, I decided that even if white       writers weren't <i>supposed </i>to write about people of color, I had to.       I simply couldn't help it; I was drawn to Rhoda Lowrie so strongly that       I couldn't think of anything else. Only later did I realize that the pull       I felt was the very essence of fiction, the writer's desperate need to walk       in someone else's shoes. Now I'm happy to find out that Madison Bell's opinion-""that       one ought make an effort to imagine the lives of others, no matter how different       they may be from one's own""-is very close to the conclusion I reached.       I would only change ""ought"" to ""must."" <br>      <br>      I envy historians, because they know so much. It was scary to watch those       who came forward in <i>Novel History</i>, graciously pointing out a certain       number of errors before pouncing on the one that's just too big to forgive.       I wonder whether I'm capable of telling a perfect truth, without a single       error. An error is a wandering, and I wander. When I was told of the mistakes       in <i>Nowhere Else on Earth</i>, I was embarrassed. How could I have gotten       that date wrong? It seems I'm able to get a grasp of truth but I can't hold       it tightly, the way the historian can. I sincerely wish I could do it. What       I felt on the trail of truth wasn't just the thrill of the chase, but the       hope I would round a corner and reach out, and <i>grab</i>, and <i>hold</i>.       <br>      <br>      I once heard a novelist say that where history leaves an empty space, the       novelist may step in. I love that. On the other hand, I think it's also       true that the novelist must then step out again, at least for a while. Writing       a true novel is hard, and somehow emotionally wracking. I liked it more       than anything I've ever done, but I don't know if I could do it again. <br>      <br>      -Josephine Humphreys<br>      <br>      <i> Josephine Humphreys won the 2000 Southern Book Critics Circle Award       for her novel </i>Nowhere Else on Earth<i> (2000), a story of the Lumbee       Indians of North Carolina at the close of the Civil War. She is a recipient       of the Lyndhurst Prize and a Guggenheim Fellowship. </i><br>      <br>      <a href=""#Top"">Back to Top</a>        <br>             <hr align=center>       <a name=""Masur""></a><br>      Whenever I teach the Civil War and Reconstruction, I assign Michl Shaara's       Pulitzer prize-winning <i>The Killer Angels</i> (Ballantine Books, ISBN       034540727X, $12.00 softcover). Of the hundreds of Civil War novels published       in the past fifty years, his is one of the most compelling, a favorite of       professional historians who normally are leery of fictional accounts of       the past. Shaara's novel works because it appeals to our emotions as well       as our intellect. He makes the battle come alive by grounding it in the       ideas and feelings of a wide cast of historical characters. And where he       invents characters, such as an Irish soldier and a runaway slave, he remains       true to the historical record as we know it. I once had a student who, after       reading the book, took a bus from New York to Gettysburg to tour the battlefield.       As far as I know, no work of nonfiction has ever had a similar effect on       my students. <br>      <br>      Shaara's book illustrates that the use of history in fiction is largely       a non-issue. Most novelists use it well, and through dialogue, character,       and plot, they help us get at the truth of history in ways that strictly       factual accounts sometimes cannot. The place of history in fiction becomes       an issue only when scholars decide to treat novelists as historians because       fiction writers dare to use the past in their work. This is akin to viewing       birds as beavers because both gather branches. The use of fiction by historians       is an even less salient question than the use of history by novelists. To       be sure, some historians have tried to incorporate fictional accounts into       their writing, but the results have been less than successful.<br>      <br>      The key issue that confronts historians is the literary quality of the nonfiction       narratives that they write. If historical writing is a literary art, then       historians need to work harder at being writers. Perhaps the only difference       between the novelist and the historian is that the novelist invents facts,       whereas the historian finds them. What each does with those facts is what       distinguishes their work, not between fiction and nonfiction but between       books that are tedious as opposed to those that are stirring.<br>      While working on his Civil War trilogy, Shelby Foote often quoted John Keats:       ""A fact is not a truth until you love it."" Good writers, whether       novelists or historians, must transform facts into truths. Novelists do       this all the time, but historians, preoccupied with professional priorities,       seem unwilling to devote as much energy to writing as to researching and       analyzing. Foote, who wrote fiction before he wrote history, said he felt       wonderful about all the little moments in his Civil War books precisely       because he didn't have to make them up. ""Making up a story is next       to nothing,"" he reminded his friend Walker Percy. ""Telling it       is everything.""<br>      <br>      The best paragraph in all of Mark Carnes' <i>Novel History</i> arrives at       the end, and it should come as no surprise that it is offered by a novelist.       Tim O'Brien, who probes the legacy of the Vietnam War and the problem of       narrating the past in <i>The Things They Carried</i> (Broadway Books, ISBN       0767902890, $13.95 softcover), has this to say about stories: ""A good       story appeals not only to the intellect, but also to the stomach and the       scalp and the tear ducts and the heart and the nape of the neck and the       back of the throat, the whole human being."" Until historians face the       lack of artistry in most nonfiction, the novelists will continue to be the       ones who get us out of our houses and pointed for the bus station. <br>      <br>      -Louis P. Masur<br>      <br>      <i>Louis P. Masur teaches history at the City College of New York and is       the author of </i>1831: Year of Eclipse<i> (2001). </i> <br>      <br>      <a href=""#Top"">Back to Top</a>        <br>             <hr align=center>       <a name=""Madden""></a><br>      Like the historian, the serious novelist begins with facts. But the historian       must cleave to them, while the novelist draws upon the emotion-charged memories       
f individuals and of a culture at large, transforming private memories       into public metaphors. The novelist goes further, into the private imagination,       shaping and transmitting truths that transcend facts alone to stimulate       public enlightenment. <br>      <br>      Most serious historical novelists, as opposed to commercial historical romance       novelists, exalt the written record of facts to a status almost sacred,       restraining the impulse to draw upon memory and imagination, with the aim       of giving the reader the illusion that he or she is really there. Most closely       aligned with the work of historians, such novels are necessary contributors       to a kaleidoscopic perspective of history. <br>      <br>      But there is another kind of historical novel that is unfortunately rare.       In the realm of American Civil War novels, Evelyn Scott's<i> The Wave </i>(Louisiana       State University Press, ISBN 0807120685, $14.95 softcover), delineates the       war in battle and on the home front and its immediate psychological effect       upon over 80 well-defined characters in a broad range of places, relationships,       and situations. The historical elements are authentic, but function mainly       in the service of psychological insight.<br>      <br>      William Faulkner's <i>Absalom, Absalom! </i>(Vintage Books, ISBN 067973218,       $12.00 softcover) takes the reader through a complex experience of the effects       of antebellum, war, and reconstruction upon several people, especially a       young man, Quentin Compson, who is told the same story in conflicting versions       by several people. They expect him to transmit the legacy of the Old South       into the twentieth century; but Quentin is psychologically impotent. Facts       are few, and the war itself is little more than alluded to. The effect upon       the emotions, the imagination, and the intellect of descendants, and upon       the reader willing to struggle with the novel's complexities, is profound       and pervasive. <br>      <br>      In Joseph Stanley Pennell's <i>The History of Rome Hanks, And Kindred Matters</i>       (Permanent Press, ISBN 0933256329, $22.00 hardcover), a young man named       Lee actively seeks the facts among surviving relatives who fought on both       sides, but imagination and emotion compete in their memories with the facts,       and Lee's own emotions, imagination, and intellect transform everything       he has read and listened to so profoundly that the legacy of the war pervades       his very identity.<br>      <br>      Even though the Civil War was thoroughly documented by its participants,       such novelists as Scott, Faulkner, Pennell, and only a few others, know-and       show-that facts alone are far from enough. They write out of an awareness       of the fact that both Northerners and Southerners, civilian and military,       entered the war ignorant of each other, that individuals and groups fought       the war in ignorance of vital facts, and that in the national consciousness,       the war is what memory and imagination make of the facts we know, facts       that are too few and undependable, except as stimulants to the creation       of myths and metaphors that light our way through successive epochs of our       history. <br>      <br>      I don't write historical novels; I write novels about the struggle of unique       individuals in history with facts, memory, and imagination. <br>      <br>      -David Madden<br>      <br>      <i>David Madden, founding director of The United States Civil War Center,       is author of </i>Sharpshooter: A Novel of the Civil War<i> (1996), and editor       of </i>Classics of Civil War Fiction<i> (1991). </i><br>      <br>      <a href=""#Top"">Back to Top</a><br>             <hr>             <center>"		Winter 2002	2001-12-01	Review	Historians and novelists discuss the relationship between history and fiction	Just the Facts?

1347			INTERVIEW:<p>'Dramatic consequences': James McPherson analyzes Antietam		Ng, Laura			"<p><b><i>Civil War Book Review (cwbr): You chose to write about September 13, 1862, and McClellan's lack of aggressive action concerning Lee's orders in </i>Days of Destiny: Crossroads in American History<i> (DK Publishing, ISBN 0789480107, $34.95, hardcover). What motivated you to choose this moment from among all others of the Civil War?</i></b><p><b>James M. McPherson (jm)</b>: The finding and verification of a copy of Lee's Orders no. 191 was potentially one of the great windfalls of military history. If McClellan had acted immediately instead of waiting six hours after he was certain of the genuineness of the orders, and if he had ordered the Union VI and IX Corps to march through the night to be in a position to attack the South Mountain passes at first light on September 14, he might have destroyed a considerable part of Lee's army in detail and would also have saved the Union garrison at Harpers Ferry. This might have enabled McClellan to carry out Lincoln's injunction to Destroy the rebel army, if possible. It might have brought the end of the war closer. It would have rescued McClellan's reputation. But it just was not in McClellan to move decisively, quickly, and aggressively, and thus the opportunity for a truly decisive victory on September 14 or 15 slipped through his hands. But the finding of the orders did set in train a series of events that led to the battle of Antietam, which, despite its equivocal tactical outcome, was nevertheless a strategic Union victory that changed the course of the war by causing Britain and France to back off from diplomatic recognition of the Confederacy, preventing probable Democratic takeover of the House of Representatives in the 1862 northern elections, arresting a disastrous decline in northern morale, and giving Lincoln the opportunity he had been awaiting to issue the Emancipation Proclamation.<p><i><b>cwbr: In your article, ""History: It's Still About Stories,"" you agree with C. Vann Woodward ""that narrative history is the story of human beings (not abstract 'forces') making choices, acting on such decisions and coping with the consequences."" How do you apply this with respect to Antietam and the military choices of McClellan, Burnside, and Lee, as well as Lincoln's decision to issue the Emancipation Proclamation based on the battle's outcome?</b></i><p><b>jm:</b> More than most campaigns in the Civil War, Antietam illustrates the true excitement of narrative history--the stories of people making choices, acting on them, and dealing with the consequences. The case of Lee illustrates dramatic decision-making and dramatic consequences. After the Union breakthrough at the South Mountain passes on September 14, Lee initially decided to abandon his Maryland invasion and retreat to Virginia before his divided army could be chewed up. But when he received word from Jackson, in the early morning of September 15, that Harpers Ferry would fall that day, Lee changed his mind and decided to make a stand at Antietam, hoping for a victory that would enable him to continue his invasion of Maryland and possibly even Pennsylvania, and further demoralize the northern people. Lee had gone north with the hope of conquering a peace for an independent Confederacy, and on September 15 his decision to stay and fight was a reaffirmation of that hope. The consequence was the battle of Antietam. You mentioned Burnside. He is a puzzle at Antietam, delaying for hours with his poorly conceived efforts to cross the bridge, then delaying further once he got his divisions across the Antietam. If he had acted more decisively and aggressively, he might have cut the ANV off from its sole retreat route across the Potomac before A.P. Hill arrived. McClellan also made at least two key decisions on September 17 that affected the outcome of the battle--a decision in the early afternoon not to reinforce the Union breakthrough at Bloody Lane with Franklin's two fresh divisions, and a decision later in the afternoon not to reinforce the success of a part of Burnside's assault almost to the streets of Sharpsburg with part of Porter's V Corps. In both cases, McClellan held back because he feared a potential counterattack by what he supposed were Lee's massive reserves (Mac credited Lee with three times as many men as he actually had) and needed to keep Franklin and Porter in reserve to meet this phantom attack. The next day McClellan made another key decision∙not to renew the attack∙again, because he feared those supposedly massive reserves. These decisions kept the value of the Union achievement at Antietam far short of what it might have been. This is a dramatic story.<p><i><b>cwbr: What do you see as the key economic and foreign affairs ramifications of the proclamation for the North and South?</b></i> <p><b>jm:</b> At first, the consequences of the Emancipation Proclamation were largely symbolic and political. And those consequences went both ways. Almost as many in the North reacted negatively to what they regarded as a shift in northern aims from union to emancipation as reacted positively to what Lincoln saw as an expansion of war aims to include emancipation as a means to achieve union. The European reaction to the preliminary proclamation of September 22 was also cynical or negative. But when they discovered in January that Lincoln really meant it, there was a powerful reaction in favor of the Union cause, especially in Britain, which pretty much ended any remaining slim hopes Southerners may have cherished for British recognition and support. The economic consequences were gradual but in the end powerful. By promising freedom, the Proclamation encouraged the already-occurring exodus of slaves to Union lines, thus weakening the Confederate economy and war effort. Eventually a large majority of the northern people fell in line behind the Proclamation, and eventually, of course, it proved to be a significant step in the transition of the southern economy from a slave-labor to a free-labor economy. <p><b><i>cwbr: Alexander Gardner's photos of Antietam were the first such depictions of war dead that confronted the public. Do you see this graphic representation changing public perception of the war and the respective causes of North and South?</i></b> <p><b>jm:</b> The Gardner photos of the dead at Antietam were certainly an eye-opener. They were the last nail in the coffin of the bright-eyed romantic vision of heroic war that both sides cherished in 1861. By changing the dull statistics about battlefield casualties into graphic photographs of bloated bodies, they reminded viewers of what was at stake in this war and what victory would cost. The pictures may also have caused some viewers to wonder whether victory would be worth the cost. But a majority felt the other way--those dead must not have died in vain. <p><i><b>cwbr: What do you consider missing from current Antietam scholarship?</b></i> <p><b>jm:</b> The current scholarship on Antietam, especially the military strategy and tactics of the campaign, is very good. The earlier books by James Murfin and Stephen Sears are outstanding. Both also provide an adequate discussion of the political and diplomatic context of the battle. Joe Harsh's recent book, <i>Taken At The Flood</i> (Kent State University Press, ISBN 0873386310, $45.00, hardcover), is an outstanding microhistory of Lee's strategic and tactical decisions and the implementation of them. In my forthcoming book I have tried to compress all of these things into a relatively brief, readable narrative and to place them in the context of the seesawing morale in armies and on the home front in both North and South during the seven or eight months leading up to the battle, and to interweave this narrative with the diplomatic efforts of the Confederacy to achieve recognition and of northern diplomats to prevent it. In doing so, however, I owe much to existing scholarship. What is different about my book is the compression of these complex events into a brief compass. <p><i><b>cwbr: America never suffered a loss of lives comparable to Antietam until September 11, 2001. Many historians and politicians have compared these two events.

The number of killed and mortally wounded at Antietam were twice the number on September 11. Both events were shocking, both caused many Americans to say that things would never again be the same. That prediction was certainly true about September 17, 1862. We are still too close to September 11, 2001, to make a final judgment. The American republic survived that earlier ghastly experience with death in September, and grew stronger and better as a consequence. I hope that this more recently ghastly experience may also lead to a stronger and better nation.<br><p><i>James M.

This work will be released in September, and will examine Antietam's part in forestalling European recognition of the Confederacy, temporarily reversing the decline in northern morale, preventing Democratic control of the House of Representatives in the election of 1862, and providing Lincoln with the occasion for issuing the Emancipation Proclamation.

1001			REDISCOVERING CIVIL WAR CLASSICS:<p> Remembering the<i> Sultana</i>	Rediscovering Civil War Classics	Madden, David			<p><br>Last spring, at the Mt. Olive Cemetery in my hometown of Knoxville, Tennessee, I attended the 13th annual reunion of the Association of<i> Sultana</i> Descendants and Friends [www.sultana.org]. Those assembled there will forever remember what most Americans a few days after the end of the Civil War forgot as quickly as they could: the sinking of the <i>Sultana</i>.<br><br> Vexing the Father of Waters for only a few hours, the <i>Sultana</i> exploded and almost 1,600 Union soldiers, homeward bound from Confederate prisons, perished. Converging lines of force in battles, hospitals, prisons brought them to that boat, that haven, with its defective boiler, its greedy officials, on the night of April 27, 1865, 18 days after the Confederates lost the war, 13 days after the Union lost its president. Did the drowning victims see their whole lives, or just the prison ordeals, flash before their eyes? And did the survivors then drown all the rest of their lives in the memory?<br><br> Prisoners of war on both sides fought some of the most courageous battles for survival. After having survived prison, most of the men on the <i>Sultana</i> perished, but over 500 others, in poor health or wounded already, injured in the explosion, battled the dark waters of the Mississippi above Memphis and survived to tell the tale. Few people listened and remembered. Growing up in the partly unionist East Tennessee mountains, I heard many Civil War stories but never that one, not until 1979, when I began research for my novel <i>Sharpshooter</i>, and the <i>Sultana</i> has haunted me ever since. A chapter in the novel deals with the <i>Sultana</i> sinking, and I may some day write a separate novel about it, but I have struggled in vain for over 20 years to comprehend this brief event, emotionally, imaginatively, and intellectually, at a depth commensurate with its importance.<br><br>Out of a compulsion to remind his countrymen and to fix the disaster in their collective consciousness, one survivor, Private Chester D. Berry, set about compiling facts, records, and personal testimonies. He published his work in 1892 under the title<b> Loss of the <i>Sultana</i> and Reminiscences of Survivors</b> (Darius D. Thorp, Printer). Like the Ancient Mariner, he wanted others to hear what he heard for the rest of his life: the screams of one victim whom he watched step off toward safety from the Sultana's burning, steeply slanting hurricane deck to the burning wheelhouse just as the wheelhouse broke up and mashed him, as in an iron vice, against the deck, where he flailed about and burned alive.<br><br>When you consider the current attention being paid to the loss of a few men in the <i>Hunley</i> submarine, lately brought up out of the mud of Charleston Bay and into the consciousness of Americans, it is all the more astonishing that the greatest maritime disaster in the history of the United States has failed, despite Berry's work and the publication of three other books in recent years, to seize the imagination of American readers. Not even the fact that the explosion on the grossly overloaded steam wheeler is yet another American scandal involving greed and irresponsibility, the conniving of civilians with military personnel, appeals to the public's insatiable hunger for such sordid conspiracies.<br><br>  Ironically, Andersonville prison, in novels, plays, movies, and nonfiction works, including eyewitness diaries, has always commanded and held the public's interest. And yet not even irony serves to hold us still long enough to grasp the impact of the <i>Sultana</i> catastrophe. The irony is this: many <i>Sultana</i> passengers were Union soldiers who survived Andersonville only to endure yet another descent into hell that spring night, as Lincoln's funeral train crossed the blood weary land and defeated Confederates straggled home. Some die of irony.<br><br> What will it take to make this event a symbolic expression, embodying every adjective for sad loss, of the Civil War? A novel more powerful than <i>Andersonville</i>, a movie more appealing than Titanic (whose losses are fewer than the <i>Sultana's</i>). Missing so far is a conceptual imagination that places the <i>Sultana</i> disaster in a tragic light. Meanwhile, the darkness of that night still hangs, almost 150 years deepening, over the smoke, the screams and the prayers of the victims and the compassionate cries of the rescuers, some of them defeated Confederate soldiers. Only the light of an extraordinary imagination can raise this unique and meaningful event from the bottom of the Father of Waters. Let us have faith. Faith that a publisher will reprint it. Faith that readers will, in empathy and sorrow, feel the sting of irony and the need, the actual desire, to imagine that night in all its strangling humanity, to retrieve and remember.<br><br>Berry's own words, the trial record concerning the officers charged with criminal negligence, and the great confluence of testimonials, long and short, arouse the reader's emotions. But, like Americans in 1865, both the survivors and the readers of Berry's book suffer a failure of imagination and of intellect when trying to deal with this immediately postwar horror. But it is a challenge deserving our effort. To turn to the other <i>Sultana</i> books, by James W. Elliott, Jerry O. Potter, and Gene Salecker, before reading Chester Berry's finger-singeing, heart-stirring assemblage of voices is very much second best. My hope is that a publisher will gladly pay the $400 (oh, hell, I'll pay) for one of the surviving copies of Berry's book and reprint it, so that Americans may begin to respond emotionally to the horrific sights, the screams, the smell of burning wood and flesh, the taste of the Mississippi, and the touch of the flailing arms of the perishing soldiers, and the civilian men, women, and children. Readers may strive to imagine the vast, complicated canvas of folly and agony, and then perhaps to ponder the web of implications, absorb into their consciousness the testimony of the survivors, the last three of whom held their final reunion near Knoxville, Tennessee, in 1919. <br><br><i>Founding director of the United States Civil War Center, David Madden has published 10 novels, including </i>Cassandra Singing<i> (reissued 1999), and over 30 works of nonfiction, including</i> Classics of Civil War Fiction (reissued 2001),<i> with Peggy Bach.

1283	817310991	$54.95 Hardcover	PERSPECTIVES FROM<br>  AFIELD AND AFAR:<p>Reading Southern History: Essays on Interpreters and Interpretations		Feldman, Glenn			"<p><br><h4>Southern view</h4>The export economy of the South has contributed a distinct legacy to the rest of America: tobacco and Wal-Mart, George Washington and George Wallace, Billy Graham and Louis Armstrong. Its insular, even tribal culture produces a style of literature and politics that, in turn, captures the interest of historians. If the South is exceptional, how and why is it so?<p>Was C. Vann Woodward right to insist that the South's tragic sensibility offers a necessary corrective to the North's hubristic idealism? Or does the persistence of southern antiquarianism reveal a withdrawal from worldly affairs, as David Potter's description of his native South suggests: ""a land that remembered the past very vividly and somewhat inaccurately, because the present had nothing exciting to offer, and accuracy about either the past or the present was psychologically not very rewarding."" <p>This much is certain: the 18 historiographical essays in <b>Reading Southern History</b>, contributed by an interdisciplinary group of scholars and edited by Glenn Feldman, collectively illustrate the fertility of the South as a research subject.<p> The literary genre of essays by scholars about fellow scholars has its origins in the now-classic work: <i>Jernegan Essays in American Historiography</i> (University of Chicago Press, 1937), edited by William T. Hutchinson. A more recent example edited by the late Robert Allen Rutland,<i> Clio's Favorites</i> (University of Missouri Press, ISBN 0826213162, $29.95, hardcover), includes four essays that overlap with<b> Reading Southern History</b> in their choice of subjects.<p> A dominant thread in the essays is the Civil War, whose disputed legacy clearly continues to inspire researchers. Although Glenn Feldman's introduction exhorts historians to retain scholarly dispassion about their subjects, such critical distance is not present in all of the essays. John Herbert Roper's treatment of Woodward is a model of historical criticism, whereas John White's account of John Hope Franklin is downright panegyrical. The essayists' uneven quality is, in one case, encountered within the same writer: Fred Arthur Bailey's contribution on E. Merton Coulter appears devoted only to documenting Coulter's racialism, yet a separate essay on Charles S. Syndor delivers a nuanced assessment of a complex man.<p>Several of the essays, such as David S. Heidler and Jean T. Heidler's profile of David Potter and Jean H. Baker's consideration of David Herbert Donald, are retrospective surveys of a scholar's whole career, whereas pieces by James Oakes on Kenneth Stampp and by Anthony Gene Carey on Frank L. Owsley focus on the influence of particular books. John Shelton Reed and Daniel Joseph Singal recall Rupert B. Vance's example of humane sociology. At the hands of other essayists in <b>Reading Southern History</b>, Ulrich B. Phillips is remembered as paradigm builder, W.E.B. DuBois as an activist-scholar, W.J. Cash as a populist historian, A. Elizabeth Taylor as a subfield pioneer, and V.O. Key Jr. as a methodological innovator.<p>Although essay collections of this kind resist unified conclusions, they often succeed admirably in raising questions that invite further reflection. For example, why did northern universities modeled after German research institutions, such as Johns Hopkins, Columbia, Chicago, and Wisconsin-Madison, give rise to social scientific interpretative traditions that now seem as crude in their racial assumptions as Bull Connor? Meanwhile many of the southern historians who rejected social science as mechanistic and inhumane simultaneously dehumanized their black neighbors. Scholars may profitably mine southern history for examples of irony, but they must not stop there.<p><i>Morgan N.

"<i>This review is also available under the following title:</i><br><i><a href=""http://www.cwbr.com/cgi-bin/dbman/cwbr/cwbr.cgi?db=cwbr&uid=default&sb1=11&so1=descend&sb2=3&so2=ascend&ma=on&fields1=Title&value1=an+honorable+defeat&view_records=1&bool=and&nh=1&mh=1"">An Honorable Defeat: The Last Days of the Confederate Government</a></i><p>One of the American Civil War's most prolific and talented writers, William C. Davis, has focused his latest effort on a misunderstood yet critical aspect of the war: coping with defeat. Most of us know from everyday life that dealing with success is relatively easy, while confronting defeat is far more difficult. It is but an aspect of all human experience. Yet the dire physical reality and mind-wrenching agony of a lost cause for which the very soul is given, and the personal despair that inevitably follows, is a devastating ordeal that reveals much about the human psyche.<p> <b>An Honorable Defeat</b> traces the fall of the Confederate government from mid-March 1865 until the bitter end and beyond. It is not a technical rendering of events and circumstances, but rather a well-crafted, researched, and thought-out depiction of personalities and leaders caught up in circumstances that they abhorred, even while compelled to act in a responsible manner. This intense flesh and blood account is witnessed largely through two key principals, Confederate President Jefferson Davis, and his Secretary of War, the venerable warrior-statesman Major General John C. Breckinridge. As Davis writes, their differing views on ""how"" the cause would be lost involved a personal struggle amid a bitter battle of ideas and emotions. Dignity, pride, and honor were at stake as well as the posterity of the southern people. Jefferson Davis wanted resistance to the extreme; his iron will, intense inner emotion, and fiery ardor for the cause precluded accepting total defeat on any terms. The more practical-minded Breckinridge was opposed to these strident views. He saw beyond the impending defeat, and was intent on planning for the South's future-to win a viable peace even if losing the war.<p> Fully revealed in the course of key decision makers dealing with an ultimate crisis is that dichotomy of perspectives whereby a vast difference is made in the lives of many. The book tells us, often minute by minute of the events that shaped the men and their actions, yet as Davis writes, the critical element was that of attitude. Would the immense resolve of Jefferson Davis and his chiseled-in-iron personality prevail? Or, would Breckinridge's competence, larger purpose and astute practicality be decisive? The answers were not always predictable and, given the magnitude of the issues, were the cornerstone of the South's future. The twists leading to the final results involved some major surprises, and make for fascinating reading. Moreover, Davis's thorough research has presented an entirely believable scenario despite the often-conflicting accounts and opinions expressed by the various participants. Indeed, Davis's forte for analyzing and depicting the personalities and their intriguing political and personal relationships is quite evident. Although his prejudices occasionally seem apparent, as with making Breckinridge an ultimate southern hero and in reviling Joe Wheeler, these are defensible perspectives. Again, while it is Davis's style to tell the tale much as a matter of fact, rather than with intense literary drama, it comes off as an absorbing story. Indeed, this is an important book, not so much in the often painful account of a crucial national leader's fall from power, but more so in the rich lessons of false vanity that history provides. His message is clear and compelling: that stubborn pride and wishful thinking have little basis as a solution to a practically resolved issue. <p>As if the beginning were any less potent than the end as a matter of historical drama, Davis has further presented an intriguing look at the Confederacy's political inception in<b> The Union That Shaped the Confederacy</b>. Described as a biography of friendship, and a story that became a virtual metaphor for the broad range of Confederate experience, William Davis's fine book transcends time, for it chronicles what he terms the tragedy of statesmen too mired in the pride of their opinions to see the broad sweep of imminent change. More dedicated to principle than to survival, these two Georgians of differing backgrounds formed a powerful if unlikely alliance that shaped the formation of the Confederacy. Yet, with great irony, they later became essential exponents of its destruction. In a remarkable story that at times reads like a novel, Davis tells with careful scholarship the tale of Robert Toombs and Alexander H. Stephens amid their ultimate ordeal: the lost hope and unfulfilled promise of the Southern Confederacy.<p> All too often we accept the past without regarding the sometimes minor nuances that reflect important turning points in life. At the outset of the secession crisis in 1861, Toombs was on the verge of becoming the Confederacy's president. Yet in a stunning reversal of form, the delegates acted to elect a secondary candidate. Some might have called it a matter of fate. Yet as Davis reveals, the practicalities involved the hard realities of defects in personality and habit.<p> Unexpectedly, Toombs's close friend Stephens was called upon to fill a responsibility that the powerful Georgia delegation had presumed would involve Toombs. Installed as the new entity's vice president, Stephens assumed a national leadership role, but in title only. The unexpected dominance by and uncompromising wielding of presidential power by Jefferson Davis soon made for frustration and political disenfranchisement for the two Georgians. The path of opposition for Toombs and later Stephens led to resistance and ultimately bitter acrimony amid many personal affronts. Marred by character traits of selfishness and egotism, Toombs turned to military service for redress, but found frustration. Stephens, cast in a meaningless role, and all but ignored by the Confederate president, remained in the background until the increasing misfortunes of the Confederacy placed him in the camp of the administration's active opposition. <p>Their collective efforts did much to arouse dissension and bring about the public turmoil that threatened the Confederacy's internal tenure. From their significant role as founding fathers of the southern Confederacy, to their idle grasping for meaning and influence as the scene played out, the friendship of Toombs and Stephens held sway-if not in perceived results, at least in the minds of many. In all, their formidable statesmanship and political expertise had made a difference in the course of the South. <p> Although the events involving the Confederacy's inception and demise were diverse and complex, Davis has provided in these two fine books a revealing glimpse of key personalities that significantly shaped the respective outcomes.

The state splits, culturally and politically, into upstate and downstate regions, with affluent suburbs in between holding the swing vote in political contests. Manhattanites are more likely to have visited Paris than Buffalo. A certain reciprocity nevertheless holds New Yorkers together: upstate streams supply New York City's drinking water; ""the City"" generates job growth throughout the state; leafy suburbs provide tax revenue. <p>An outgrowth of a 1999 symposium sponsored by the New York State Archives Partnership Trust, State of the Union: New York and the Civil War provides a timely reminder that similar political tensions wracked New York during the Civil War, making it an essential but unstable constituent in the Union effort. As editor Harold Holzer notes, New York's contributions of men, materiel, and money to the war effort surpassed those of any other northern state. Yet Abraham Lincoln's share of the popular vote in New York actually declined in 1864 (50.4%) from 1860 (53.7%). <p>Essays by Holzer, Joseph W. Bellacosa, Frank J. Williams, and Hans L. Trefousse focus on New York's relationship with Lincoln and Andrew Johnson. <p>Bellacosa and Williams debate Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus and other constitutional safeguards, with Bellacosa, a former justice on the New York State Court of Appeals, posing this question: ""Was the real goal of this extraordinary deprivation of liberties and due process the lofty preservation of the Union--or was the activity a shield for suppressing powerful political opposition and dissenting expression and a sword for enforcing conscription?"" Williams, chief justice of the Rhode Island Supreme Court, replies that Lincoln used imperial means to secure benign ends. He allows that Lincoln was not above counting ""popular, congressional, and judicial votes"" but insists that such scheming conserved the Constitution. <p>In his essay on Andrew Johnson's impeachment, Trefousse describes New York's public as divided over the merits of removing Johnson from office. During the first Reconstruction years, control of New York's legislature alternated between parties, and while the state's Republican senators in Washington both supported Johnson's removal, the business community worried about possible commercial repercussions. <p>The remaining essays in <b>State of the Union</b> cover social and historical topics. Iver Bernstein's examination of the infamous July 1863 riots in Manhattan and Troy notes that what began as a draft riot turned into a race riot, one in which Irish immigrants violently reacted against the prospect of being displaced by lower-income black workers. <p>Lillian Serece Williams's essay considers the war's disruptive effect on gender and class relations. Williams suggests that white Northerners otherwise opposed to emancipation took up the Union cause to prove themselves to white women. <p>Shifting attention to western New York, Lonnie R. Speer documents the harsh conditions that made the Elmira prison camp the Union equivalent to Andersonville. A camp designed for 5,250 captured Confederates routinely held between 8,000 and 10,000. <p>State of the Union opens with a foreword by Jeff Shaara, who observes, ""History is not a measure of years, it is a measure of deeds."" The essays offer testimony on how the sudden tragedy in April 1865 united New Yorkers in grief, as Lincoln's funeral train slowly wound its way through New York City and upstate towns. Much has changed in the Empire State since then, but in the aftermath of September 2001 we know that the center still holds.  <p><i>Morgan N.

On that list, I also include<i> Tate's The Fathers</i> (Swallow Press, ISBN 0804001081, $9.95, softcover) and Andrew Lytle's<i> The Long Night</i> (University of Alabama Press, ISBN 0817304150, $14.95, softcover).<p>  Two years after Warren's biography of John Brown, Andrew Lytle, strictly a novelist, published <i>Bedford Forrest and His Critter Company</i> (JS Sanders & Co., ISBN 1879941090, $15.95, softcover), his first book. In 1936, <i>The Long Night,</i> one of his finest novels, appeared.<p> All three writers published memorable essays in<i> I'll Take My Stand: The South and the Agrarian Tradition</i> (Louisiana State University Press, ISBN 0807103578, $19.95, softcover). Taken all together, with this book, the work of these novelists/poets constitutes a unique, astonishingly coherent vision of the war and of the contemporary South.<p>  All four Civil War biographies were commissioned by the same publisher, Minton Balch. I like to imagine that the young novelists were offered a way to make money quickly and got engaged with the enterprise because all books rise above such circumstances. The creative energy, passion, and personal commitment is right there on the surface and sinks profoundly into the reader's consciousness; years later, that intellectual and poetic energy still resonates. Discover for yourself.<p> While you still can. Having discovered that all four books were out of print and were costly in the rare book trade, I urged every publisher with whom I came in contact to reprint them, preferably as a boxed set, so that one could read them all at once in the context of their Fugitive and Agrarian roots. Warren and Lytle were still alive at that time and still publishing, 50 years later. Finally, I persuaded John Sanders, who brought them out one by one. Although Sanders sold his excellent small publishing house, the books are still in print. It is likely the print run will sell out soon and when it does, I will gladly leap into the saddle once more to whip up enthusiasm for reprinting all.<p>Meanwhile, now that all three are among the dead, we may look in vain for individuals or groups who are doing similarly major work in multiple genres in the effort, a century and a half long, to make Walt Whitman's phrase ""the unwritten war"" fade away like a grand old soldier.<p> <i> Founding Director of The United States Civil War Center, David Madden is the author of seven novels, including</i> Sharpshooter (1996),<i> two collections of short stories, and editor of</i> The Legacy of Robert Penn Warren (2000)<i> and two nonfiction works on the Civil War.

2361	820323306	$24.95	PERSPECTIVES FROM AFIELD AND AFAR:<p>Nations Divided: America, Italy, and the Southern Question		Doyle, Don H.			<br><br>The strong winds of political unification during the 1990s were met with a countervailing gust of nationalism. Germany reunited and the European Union solidified, even as the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia disintegrated sectional movements in such places as Quebec, Scotland, and Italy gained momentum. Shifting territorial boundaries, not to mention political alliances, kept both states-men and cartographers gainfully employed throughout the decade. <p>Don H. Doyle's <b>Nations Divided </b>is, in part, a comparative historical survey of longstanding regional tensions in the United States and Italy. Doyle is a history professor at Vanderbilt University, but his initial enchantment with Italy grew out of travel rather than academic study. Now he has assembled, in under 100 pages of prose, a synthesis that considers the parallel evolution of the United States and Italy. <p>The north/south divisions of both countries particularly attract Doyle's interest. A Fulbright fellowship took Doyle to Genoa in 1995, during what now appears to have been the crest of the Northern League, a vaguely secessionist political party in Italy's wealthy north. Back in the U.S., Republicans had captured both houses of Congress running on a platform of devolving power to the states. In both Italy and the U.S., longstanding regional tensions were associated with these movements. American journalists began writing about the Southern captivity of the Republican party, while some southern Italians adopted the Confederate flag as a symbol of resistance to their more prosperous northern countrymen. <p><b>Nations Divided</b> traces the United States from its origins as, in Doyle's reading, the first liberal and transnational state, through the rise of regional differences that culminated in the Civil War, to the present-day marital truce between north and south. Italian unification, in contrast, occurred relatively late in the 19th century, and was inspired by Garibaldi's Italian nationalism, itself a Romantic throwback to Csarism and the Renaissance, rather than a derivative of Anglo-American liberal theory. As in Germany, Italy's unification was violent and had a pronounced anti-clerical and anti-monarchal ideological fervor that has little relation to the American Civil War, which was fought between two countries that each claimed George Washington as their founding father. <p>Doyle gently pushes to color Italy's post-unification history as a halting progression toward the modernization and secularization that the U.S. is credited with pioneering, which perhaps unavoidably generates in its wake a political backlash in those regions and industries that either fear or cannot compete with the new economic order. When Doyle asked an Italian professor-friend whether southern Italians understood the significance of the Confederate flag, she replied that they did. We too are a defeated people, she explained. <p>One question that Doyle leaves unexamined is the causal direction of Italy's resurgent regionalism. Robert D. Putnam's study of Italy's devolution of power during the 1970s from the centralized state to regional institutions, published in 1993 as <i>Making Democracy Work,</i> attributes the early 1990s success of regional political parties to regional pride, anger against the inefficiencies of Rome, backlash against handouts' to corrupt southerners, and veiled racism. The rest of Putnam's book makes the case that this regional consciousness is in no small way an unintended consequence of the 1970s decentralization initiatives. This is a more empirical, but far less interesting, account of contemporary Italian society than we encounter in <b>Nations Divided.</b> <p>CWBR <i>contributing editor Morgan N.

2360			INTERVIEW:<p>Compelling images enhance narrative histories:<br> Interview with William C. Davis		Fava, Colleen H.	Jewett, Leah Wood		<i>William C. Davis is the author or editor of more than 40 books on the Civil War and Southern history, as well as numerous documentary screenplays. He has served as historical consultant on various television and film productions. Davis has twice been nominated for the Pulitzer Prize in history and is currently professor of history at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. His most recent book,<b> The Civil War in Photographs</b> (Carlton 2002), served as the platform for this interview. </i><p><b><i>Civil War Book Review (CWBR): In your introduction to The Civil War in Photographs, you discuss the coming of age of photography in the midst of the Civil War. How did the war foster the development of photojournalism? </i></b><p><b>William Davis (WD): </b>We need to distinguish clearly between the impact of the war on photography û which was considerable û and its impact on photojournalism, a term that did not yet exist. The war, of course, was something of a bonanza for some photographers, though not in the way many people might think. Mathew Brady and his studio did not make much from war photography, and neither did others like Timothy O'Sullivan, Alexander Gardner, and more. The Southern artists like Jay Edwards and George Cook made even less, of course. The demand for war scenes proved to be disappointing, perhaps because the idea was too new and the buying public was not accustomed to purchasing items that had not yet evolved to a place in the American consumer's world. The real money in photography was not in battlefield scenes but in soldier portraits, the ubiquitous cartes-de-visite that were produced in the hundreds of thousands, and to the extent that wide-scale experience at photography resulted from the war, it was in the portraits that most artists gained growing expertise, and financial reward. <p>Photojournalism is another matter. It did not exist, nor did illustrated journalism in general, other than in the so-called illustrated newspapers of the day, <i>Harper's Weekly, Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper, </i>and the <i>New York Illustrated News</i> in the North, and, briefly, the <i>Southern Illustrated News</i> of Richmond. Perhaps journalism itself needs definition here, because of course there were several monthly illustrated journals at the time, but they were hardly timely enough to meet our understanding of journalism today. As for the aforementioned weeklies, they were real journalism, but the illustrations were pretty hastily done woodcuts. During the course of the war, many of their illustrations of camp scenes and generals would actually be based on photographs, but these provided no more news content than did the sketches done on the spot by the artists who traveled with the armies on behalf of the weeklies. In short, so far as photojournalism was concerned, photography really provided nothing that readers at home were not getting, or could not get, already by other means. Thus, the impact of Civil War photography on the future of photojournalism as a craft and industry was, in my estimation anyhow, negligible. <p><b><i>CWBR: How did photographyùincluding images of the living and the dead, and the political and military leaders on both sidesùaffect public opinion? </i></b><p><b>WD:</b> Because photographyùagain here we are really talking about the scenes that showed the face of war rather than the 99% of war photographs that were just soldier portraitsùdid not really have a big impact on the Northern home front, and none at all in the South, I would say that it had little or no impact on public opinion. What the public for the most part did not see could hardly influence them. The one exception would be in the political arena, perhaps, in which photo portraits of candidates, chiefly Lincoln and Douglas in 1860 and Lincoln and McClellan in 1864, were mass-produced and widely circulated. Did seeing a photo of a candidate influence a voter? I've seen no direct evidence that it did, but since it was all part of public awareness, as it is today, I think we have to take it on faith that it did. <p>But the photos of the dead in the Bloody Lane at Antietam simply did not reach a wide enough audience to have much impact in areas such as war-weariness, and again in the Confederacy there was no circulation of scenes at all other than several dozen early camp scenes taken by Edwards, and those hardly got out of the orbit of New Orleans. <p><b><i>CWBR: It has been said that some photographers physically arranged dead bodies for maximum emotional impact. Did photographers such as Mathew Brady, Alexander Gardner, and Timothy O'Sullivan actively engage in taking photographs for the purpose of propaganda? </i></b><p> <b>WD:</b> Most of the artists who took war views did some posing of props and even bodies. Certainly at Devil's Den at Gettysburg, the Brady operatives and others rearranged a few Rebel corpses. Then there was a lot of posing of live soldiers as if they were dead. However, to call these propaganda would be going too far, I think, especially as it conjures our modern imagery of propaganda. There is no evidence that the photographers were trying to make a point or exaggerate the horrors of war to influence people back home. They were just artists trying to make a better picture. The photos of the Andersonville survivors, which of course appeared only after the surrender, could qualify as real propaganda, but they were powerful, and still are. <p><b><i>CWBR: Much of what we knowùand feelùabout the Civil War comes from photographs. In comparison to primary text sources, how important is photography to our current understanding and interpretation of the war? What can photographs tell us that narrative cannot? </i></b><p><b>WD:</b> Most of what the photographs can tell us that texts cannot is the ambience of the war, and especially of the ordinary soldier's daily camp life. Keep in mind that photos were still rarely candid in our acceptance of the meaning. Most were in some degree posed, and there are significant aspects even of soldier life that were not captured by the lens. They illustrate, rather than supplant, the narrative texts upon which in the end we still mainly have to rely. It would remain for wars of another later century for the photographer, especially the motion picture cameraman, to really capture the full and unvarnished look of warfare. <p><b><i>CWBR: Photographs of dead soldiers and veterans with empty sleeves proliferated during and immediately after the war. Do you think that these images hindered reconciliation between North and South? Can the availability of photographs help explain the nationwide phenomenon of memorialization that blossomed after the war and continues today? </i></b><p> <b>WD:</b> In a word, no. The empty sleeve photos were too much confined to the immediate families of the amputees. The so-called bloody shirt of the Radical Republicans, used so effectively in maintaining political power, was only metaphorical. In fact, they made little use at all of war pho-tography. But then, until well after the turn of the century they did not need the photos, because they could parade around the actual maimed veterans themselves. <p><b><i>CWBR: Many books of Civil War era photographs have been published in the past. What makes</i> The Civil War in Photographs<i> different? </i></b><p><b>WD: The Civil War in Photographs,</b> if it is different from other similar works, is so only to the extent of the previously unpublished images it presents, especially of common sol-diers. Otherwise, I am not sure that any of the photographic works since the very first over a century ago have been truly different from each other. Rather, they are all variations on a compelling theme. <p><b><i>CWBR: A prolific writer and scholar, you have worked on numerous Civil War-related projects, from scholarly books to film documentaries. How does the story change when you move from a text-focused to an image-focused medium? Do you find that each suits a particular audience, i.e., academic versus popular, better than the other? </i></b><p><b>WD:</b> The shift from text to image, as you suggest, is certainly reflected in the audience reached, especially as we become more and more a visually stimulated and informed culture. It was photographs that originally got me interested in the Civil War as a child, and they are still, I think, a wonderful window for introducing neophytes, who may then find their interest sparked to proceed from the image to the depth that only narrative text can provide. Also text can be all encompassing, whereas with images one is severely restricted by what the photographers found interesting and where they worked. Whole areas of the Civil War experience simply cannot be illustrated by contemporary photos, because none were taken. <p><b><i>CWBR: Since the Civil War, photography has become the expected witness of human conflict. With the click of a button, modern audiences can immediately retrieve photographs of the latest act of war around the globe. Is this the legacy of Civil War photography? </i></b><p><b>WD:</b> Again, while the impulse of a journalist would be to say yes, Civil War photography created our perception of photography as war's witness, the historian would have to say no, I think. Civil War photography, in the end, did not really bring that war to people of its own time nearly as much or as effectively as it has brought that war to later generations, starting around 1900, through development of the half-tone printing process. And even by World War I Americans were still not really getting their war impressions as much from images as from word journalism. It is only the moving picture that pushed text aside in our expectations. If Civil War photography has a role in the creation of war photojournalism at all, it is probably in the technological push that came from the war, and in the reputations established for men like Gardner and O'Sullivan, who were thus able to keep photography alive as something more than a hobby or small-time professionùthough it barely sup-ported themùuntil the newsreel could capture real life in real time, and the explosion of the motion picture industry, followed by television, made voyeurs of us all.

1240			EDITORIAL: <p>Between history and fiction		Ng, Laura			"<br>Unfortunately fiction and history, both the products of our contemplation, compilation, and creativity, have not always been happy bedfellows. Historians fear that writers will abandon all facts, as William Faulkner seems to advocate: ""I don't care much for facts, am not much interested in them, you can't stand a fact up, you've got to prop it up, and when you move to one side a little and look at it from that angle, it's not thick enough to cast a shadow in that direction."" How much ""propping"" a writer should do is open to debate. On the other hand, writers tend to see history as a long laundry list of dull facts crying out for interpretation and imagination.<p> How do we bridge the gap? We asked four distinguished individuals, Herman Hattaway, Josephine Humphreys, Louis Masur, and David Madden, to give us their opinions on this complex relationship. Their insights and experiences reveal the relationship between history and fiction as that of long lost brothers rather than a mirror of the cold conflict of North versus South.<p>In our mindscapes we create our own balance of history and fiction, attaching opinions and possibilities to the events of our lives. We create a collective crazy quilt of happenstance and circumstance that when exchanged with and accepted by others becomes ""public memory."" But before memory can be public, it must be private. In this issue's ""Rediscovering Civil War Classics,"" guest columnist James I. Robertson Jr. examines the personal history of Henry Nelson Blake through his memoir,<i> Three Years in the Army of the Potomac</i> (Lee and Shepherd, 1865).<p>Between the last battles of war and the first struggles of Reconstruction, troops on both sides demobilized and began their long journeys home. Terrence Winschel reviews<i> Homeward Bound</i> by William B. Holberton (Stackpole Books, ISBN 0811707881, $24.95 hardcover), and uncovers the transition from soldier and citizen, a time when reflection first transformed Civil War history into myth. The harsh light of fact drives tragic elements of history, such as slavery, from the shadows. Public memory then molds the myths and sentimentality that we continue to attach to the Civil War today. <i>The Reel Civil War</i> by Bruce Chadwick (Alfred A. Knopf, ISBN 0375409181, $27.50, hardcover) and Fiction as Fact<i> by Neil Longley York</i> (Kent State University Press, ISBN 0873386884, $18.00, softcover), reviewed in this issue, analyze how Hollywood's manipulation of fact and fiction has created products for national consumption. <p>It is clear that Faulkner's claimed aversion to ""facts"" is intended to convey the idea that history is a set of perspectives. When we shift positions, new perspectives unfold before us. In these hidden areas lives fiction and possibility, ripe for harvesting. These new perspectives inspire work such as: <i>Lee in the Shadow of Washington</i> by Richard B. McCaslin (Louisiana State University Press, ISBN 0807126969, $29.95, hardcover) a nonfiction exploration of Lee as the heir to a Revolutionary legend;<i> Exile in Richmond</i> (University Press of Virginia, ISBN 0813920183, $35.00, hardcover) and <i>A Prussian Observes the American Civil War</i> (University of Missouri Press, ISBN 0826213480, $34.95 hardcover) that each reveal how the war appeared from the outside; and David Poyer's novel,<i> Fire on the Waters</i> (Simon & Schuster, ISBN 0684871335, $25.00, hardcover) that illustrates that the war from the inside, from the imagination, is best captured in fiction. <p>We cannot, and should not, separate history and fiction. History inspires our imaginations, pushes us to look beyond the surface of fact and to creatively explore facets of the past that reflect upon our nation and ourselves. The books that range the spectrum from scholarly replication of facts to imagined possibilities offer valuable points of view into our past. From our perspective, these fresh insights and ideas promise better scholarship.

2359	195158164	$22.00	REDISCOVERING CIVIL WAR CLASSICS: <p>Uncle Tom's Cabin		Stowe, Harriet Beecher	Johnson, Charles		<br><br>This novel, sesquicentennial edition of Harriet Beecher Stowe's world classic novel <b>Uncle Tom's Cabin</b> is Charles Johnson's book. His brief but forceful and provocative introduction will overwhelm whatever the reader experiences in the Johnson has written four novels, one of which, <i>Middle Passage, </i>winner of the National Book Award, brings alive the agony of slaves packed flesh against flesh in the hell holds of ships out of Africa. He has had his say in his own novel and now, on this special occasion, he declares an attitude and sets a tone for the novel with which Stowe is to have her say. <p>According to Johnson, <b>Uncle Tom's Cabin</b> can still serve us, though not in the way that Stowe and her admirers intended. It invites us to discuss whether a white author can successfully portray a black person<i> in his own terms,</i> instead of through the distorting, funhouse mirror of white, Eurocentric ideas about people of color. . . . Stowe's book challenges us in 2002 to ask whether it is possible ever to write well the lived experience of the racial Other. And for that reason, if none other, her novel deserves attention at this dawn of a new millennium.</p><p>My own answer, as a novelist, to Johnson's question is, YES! in thunder. A NO! answer, if I believed it, would force me to surrender to barbarism my conviction that the imagination of writers, as a God-given gift, is potent enough to penetrate all human mysteries, and that the compassion of readers, as a God-given gift, is rich enough to respond fully to the writers' expressions of those mysteries. Nothing human is alien to me, said the second-century playwright Terence.</p><p>Johnson does not answer his own question. He leaves that much room for readers to try to experience Stowe's own intentions and make their own literary and humanistic judgments. The NO! answer that some people shout means that humans who are not black can never understand blacks, as if they were not only another race, but another species, an idea cherished by racists in Stowe's day and that was her prime target. NO! is an answer that leads humanity to accept, ultimately, to paraphrase William Faulkner, the end of man. And humanity must refuse to accept that.</p><p>Johnson's introduction may make the novel unreadable for some readers. But I would turn his caveat around 180 degrees and declare with equal force that Johnson's insights, comments, and questions can provide reasons enough to reread the novel that made Abraham Lincoln, on meeting Harriet Beecher Stowe, say, So this is the little lady who wrote the book that made this great war. First-time readers may wonder why a classic that Johnson says is somewhat badly written and somewhat racist in spite of its aims is worth reading at all. </p><p>Johnson's novel won a prize. Stowe's novel won the hearts of untold millions worldwide and, unique among novels, helped win a war that freed the slaves about whom Johnson wrote more graphically than Stowe. Why not read both books and weep?</p><p> <i>Founding director of the United States Civil War Center, David Madden is author of the Civil War novel, </i>Sharpshooter, <i>and editor of </i>Classics of Civil War Fiction<i> and </i>Beyond the Battlefield.</p>	Madden, David	Winter 2003	2002-12-01	Classics		Literature in context	Oxford University Press					"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=243 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/uncletomscabin.jpg"">"						
1280			EDITORIAL: <p>Looking Forward to the Past		Ng, Laura			"<br>For me, the New Year embodies a sentiment best expressed by President John F. Kennedy: ""We must use time as a tool, not as a couch."" And while the turning of the calendar begs for a nostalgic mental journey into the past, it is the historian and history lover that truly understand the power of this pivotal point. It is not the comfort of the familiar that they seek; rather it is the contemplation of the one watershed moment that will simultaneously create a new moment while redefining the original. This mental exploration brings to light new factors that transform understanding something that even the sweetest moments of Proustian remembrance fail to do. <p> This transforming perception keeps events like Lincoln's assassination vital and in the forefront of study. More than a century after the fact, works such as Edwards Steers Jr.'s <i>Blood on the Moon</i> (University of Kentucky Press, ISBN 0813122171, $29.95, hardcover) inspire our inner detectives to investigate the complex historical web surrounding it. Like a phoenix, Lincoln continually emerges from the ashes, forever resurrected in our minds.<p> And there are others.

Kent Gramm looks at Robert Penn Warren's re-released Civil War novel, <i>Wilderness</i> (University of Tennessee Press, ISBN 1572331348, $19.50, soft cover) and illustrates that classic tales continue to fascinate and entertain. David Madden brings to light Civil War works of both fiction and non-fiction, including Allen Tate's<i> The Fathers</i> (Swallow Press, ISBN 0804001081, $9.95, soft cover), that reveal insights into men and war with provoking clarity. Rounding out our literature section is a review of <i>Faulkner's County</i> (University of North Carolina Press, ISBN 0807849316, $49.95, hardcover) that deals with the intense influence history has upon great writing.<p> In the spirit of continued revelation, Barbara Cloud speaks out about the Civil War and the Cherokee Nation.

Carolyn P.

The culmination of Fremantle's three-month trek through the shrinking C.S.A. was watching Gettysburg alongside Longstreet and Lee. Although sympathetic to viewing Southerners as a ""gallant race"" after being feted by them in Natchez, Charleston, and Richmond, Fremantle's initial travel through Texas and Louisiana exposed him to frontier hardships. And in due time he was introduced to the ways of Yankee commercialism. Encountering some hostile Pennsylvanians during the Gettysburg campaign, Fremantle recorded his reaction: ""The sight of gold, which I exchanged for their greenbacks, brought about a change, and by degrees they became quite affable"" (<i>The Fremantle Diary</i>).<br><br>French aristocrat Camille de Polignac was only 29 when he obtained a commission from Jefferson Davis. Before war's end, he had received a promotion to major general and an introduction to American culture. Near Corinth, Mississippi, he observed a shunpike that allowed travelers to skirt paying the turnpike toll. ""How very American!"" he exclaimed. Jeff Kinard's Polignac biography, Lafayette of the South, recalls other anecdotes: Polignac charming Richmond society; enduring an impromptu piano recital in North Louisiana; winning the respect of his scrappy Texas brigade by leading them into battle with the cry, ""Come on boys, come on, these things do make a hell of a noise but don't hurt much!"" <br><br>But some visitors were resistant to southern comfort. Francis Springer, a Lutheran minister and Republican activist from Springfield, Illinois, who served as a Union army chaplain throughout the Trans-Mississippi, entered his reflections in a field journal (<i>The Preacher's Tale</i>). ""The eulogists of Chivalry are heard to say, the Yankees are a money-loving, grasping tribe; while the southerners are free-hearted & liberal,"" he wrote. ""Is such praise of the one & sneer at the other justified by the facts?"" He would entertain no illusions about the gracious manners of slaveholders and secessionists.<br><br> Similarly Jean-Charles Houzeau, a Belgian naturalist and progressivist who edited the black daily New Orleans Tribune between 1864-68, witnessed the infamous riot of July 1866 and loathed the decadence of the white Creole population. ""The European quarter of New Orleans is a disgrace for a civilized city,"" he confided in a letter. ""What a contrast with the severity of the Anglo-Saxons, who are without doubt cold, but who control themselves"" (<i>My Passage at the New Orleans Tribune</i>).<br><br> Each traveler departed the South under different conditions-Fremantle prophesying Confederate victory, Polignac on a desperate diplomatic bid to France, Springer reveling in Union victory, Houzeau in despair over Reconstruction's failure. In common, however, all were transformed by their travels, sometimes despite themselves. And, in turn, the accounts they left behind transform readers like us.<br><br> If your local public or university library does not already carry <i>Civil War Book Review</i>, please consider asking the staff to purchase a subscription.

1243	813021049	$59.95	PERSPECTIVES FROM<BR>AFIELD AND AFAR:<p>  Myth, Memory, and the Making of the American Landscape		Shackel, Paul A.			"<br><p><h4>The Power of Place</h4> The political significance of death and memorialization is a persistent theme in history and literature. A triumphant but doomed Achilles desecrated the body of Hector before relinquishing it to the Trojans; ""unknown soldiers"" are retrieved from distant battlefields and reinterred on native soil; the Bolsheviks burned the bodies of the Romanovs lest Russian royalists venerate a public gravesite. Even the recent terrorist attack on the United States has summoned symbolizations of grief and remembrance.<p> In the introduction to<b> Myth, Memory, and the Making of the American Landscape,</b> University of Maryland anthropologist Paul A. Shackel pledges that the essays he has edited in this collection will ""demonstrate how the memories associated with highly visible objects are always being constructed, changed, challenged, or ignored."" As such rhetoric suggests, the anthropologists and historians who join Shackel in contributing to the volume generally approach their subjects with a postmodernist interpretative framework that stresses how race/gender/class considerations undergird the public memorialization of famous figures and events. <p>Postmodernism has served as a useful corrective to impersonal historical accounts, even if some practitioners engage in a different kind of reductiveness by imposing tendentious theories on the actions of earlier generations, without ever considering facts and events within their own context. It might be said that some of the dozen essays in this collection are informed by postmodernism; others are deformed by it. Six are pertinent to Civil War studies; the other six address topics ranging from the memorialization of George Washington's birthplace to the revitalization of Baltimore's Camden Yards. Audrey J. Horning opens the collection with a piece entitled ""Of Saints and Sinners: Mythic Landscapes of the Old and New South."" A historical archologist at Queen's University of Belfast, Horning contrasts two New Deal projects in Virginia: the restoration of Jamestown Island to its colonial appearance and the return of Shenandoah National Park to its pre-settlement landscape. Horning asks: ""What pasts do we choose to remember, and why?"" <p> Two essays address battlefield interpretation. In ""The Third Battle of Manassas: Power, Identity, and the Forgotten African-American Past"" archologist Erika K. Martin Seibert decries the focus on battles and troop movements at Manassas. Despite Manassas having been the site of two important battles, Seibert insists that social history be given equal place in park interpretation. <p>The essay by National Park Service archologist Martha Temkin, ""Freeze-Frame, September 17, 1862: A Preservation Battle at Antietam National Battlefield Park"" is more commendable. Temkin traces Antietam's evolution from a military cemetery to a full-fledged tourist destination. But in the early 1990s, the National Park Service decided to remove access roads built in the 1890s and to forbid construction of further memorials. This approach, known as ""freezing,"" is controversial because it interprets a site in a date-specific way, rather than permitting the site to organically evolve. It creates a conundrum for postmodernists, who generally appreciate historical evolution, except when it leads to commercial development that encroaches upon park boundaries. <p>Three essays tackle the memorialization of Civil War dead. Paul Shackel, in ""The Robert Gould Shaw Memorial: Redefining the Role of the Fifty-Fourth Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry"" recounts the history of Augustus Saint-Gaudens's famous sculpture on Boston Common. In an essay entitled ""Buried in the Rose Garden: Levels of Meaning at Arlington National Cemetery and the Robert E. Lee Memorial,"" Laurie Burgess of the Smithsonian Institution contends that the creation of Arlington cemetery can be understood as ""an act of war,"" in which ""an army of the dead took the battlefield."" The collection closes with National Park Service historian Dwight T. Pitcaithley's balanced ""Abraham Lincoln's Birthplace Cabin: The Making of an American Icon."" <p><b>Myth, Memory, and the Making of the American Landscape</b> offers readers a valuable sourcebook, with the best essays illustrating how the prevailing approach to historical interpretation has evolved over generations. But for a collection that so directly addresses death and memory, the essays are strangely silent on the religious dimension to memorialization. A more poignant treatment of this subject can be found in John Keegan's elegant account of the post-World War I creation of British military cemeteries, ""There's Rosemary for Remembrance"" (The American Scholar, Summer 1997). <p><i>Morgan N.

1346			REDISCOVERING CIVIL WAR CLASSICS:<p>Thomas Wolfe's Civil War		Wolfe,Thomas			"<p><br>Two mythic achievements in the novel form have eluded the creative powers of both the greatest northern and southern writers: the Great American Novel and the Great Civil War Novel. I am convinced that the Great American Novel must also be the Great Civil War Novel. Thomas Wolfe, who wrote ""Chickamauga"",""The Four Lost Men"", and scattered passages in his novels deliberately about the Civil War, is one of the best examples of a southern writer whose entire body of work is indirectly about the Civil War.<p>""The Four Lost Men"", in <i>From Death to Mourning,</i> (Macmillan, 1983) has Wolfe's description of the effect of the advent of World War I on everyone serves to describe as well the Civil War's effect upon the South. ""The war had got in everything: it was in things that moved, and in things that were still, in the animate red silence of an old brick wall as well as in the thronging life and traffic of the streets.""<p>Had I world enough and time, I would try to support those claims, but space is limited. I will simply claim that ""Chickamauga"" and ""The Four Lost Men"" are among our finest Civil War short stories.<p>""Chickamauga"", found in <i>The Hills Beyond</i> (Louisiana State University Press, ISBN 0807125679, $17.95, softcover), is simple but unique in Civil War literature. Its achievement comes from its sthetic unity. The structure, four battles and the theme four, changes the war wrought in the characters' lives are perfectly meshed. This story has more obvious organization than any of Wolfe's other stories and most other first-person Civil War short stories.<p>In ""The Four Lost Men"", Wolfe resurrects his father's four dead Civil War heroes and thus to some extent his father, and instills in us a vision of all the lost men of all wars.<p>In contrast to the simple narrative of ""Chickamauga"", ""The Four Lost Men"" is a visionary, conceptualized fiction. It provides the kind of unique perspective on the Civil War that, amid the endless sameness of much writing about the war, we crave. It is an excruciatingly poignant meditation on the impossibility of experiencing events of great magnitude on a level commensurate with their scope, complexity, and implications. The urge to recover the unrecoverable, experience the ineffable, express what is too metaphysical for words struggles magnificently. By expressing a concept of the war and its lingering effects through implication, ""The Four Lost Men"" is the single greatest short story about the Civil War. <p>It is not that he wrote these stories but the way he wrote them, with masterful artistic skill, that persuades me Thomas Wolfe had the potential for writing the Great Civil War Novel. Indirectly, in the sense that everything a southern writer creates is about the Civil War, he did write about the Civil War. But only direct intention can produce the novel we all hanker for. One reviewer declared that <i>The Hills Beyond</i>, Wolfe's last book, ""might have been the greatest realistic southern picture of Reconstruction Days."" In the deepest sense, a novel about Reconstruction is a Civil War Novel. Perhaps a publisher will reprint that book in an edition that includes ""Chickamauga"" and a few related stories and passages from novels. <p>The fabled Great American Novel will have to be suffused with the Civil War, and only a southern writer is temperamentally capable of writing it. Of all the southern writers who died young, I am convinced that Thomas Wolfe could have written and probably would have written, that Great American Novel. <p>This article derived from a talk delivered at the Thomas Wolfe Conference at Gettysburg in May 1996 and published in The Thomas Wolfe Review, Fall 1997.<p><i>David Madden is the author of three books on the Civil War, including a novel, </i>Sharpshooter. <i>He is co-editor of the </i>Classics of Civil War Fiction<i> series for the University of Alabama Press and Founding Director of the United States Civil War Center.</i>"	Madden, David	Summer 2002	2002-06-01	Classics		Thomas Wolfe's Civil War						"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=254 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/Wolfe'sCivilWar.jpg"">"						
2487			EDITORIAL: <p>Writing the War		Fava, Colleen H.			<p><br>Two segments included in this issue of Civil War Book Review directly address the fact that the Civil War has been the focus of an enormous amount of literary and scholarly attention. In his Rediscovering Civil War Classics column, David Madden takes a look at <b>The Unwritten War: American Writers and the Civil War</b> by Daniel Aaron (University of Alabama Press, ISBN O817350020, $26.95, softcover). Madden reiterates Aaron's and Walt Whitman's early claims that the real war will never get into the books or, more specifically, that no single volume could contain a complete account of this monumental event. Inspired by <b>The Shenandoah Valley Campaign of 1862</b> edited by Gary W. Gallagher (University of North Carolina Press, ISBN 080782786X, $34.95, hardcover), the eighth edition in the <i>Military Campaigns of the Civil War Series</i> from UNC, reviewer Kevin Levin addresses a theory pronounced by Bernard Bailyn in <i>Ordeal of Thomas Hutchinson</i> (Harvard University Press, 1976). Bailyn's text published in 1976 û shortly after Aaron's text in 1974 û poses a similar concern and seeks to find the real war in print. Madden and Aaron lament Whitman's prophecy that fiction and poetry will never quite contain the entirety of the war. Levin and Gallagher welcome the passage of time that has necessarily distanced writers from the events of the War, creating a climate that fosters analyses and that will culminate, as Levin says, in Bailyn's ultimate mode of interpretation. Whether or not some future, single, comprehensive text emerges, the sheer volume of publications and forums are testimony to the fact that interest in the War is alive and well.</p><p>The political landscape, from the antebellum through the Reconstruction period, is thoughtfully addressed in James D. Hardy Jr.'s examination of <b>Patriot Fires: Forging a New American Nationalism in the Civil War North</b> by Melinda Lawson (University of Kansas Press, ISBN 07006112076, $29.95, hardcover) and in Ward A.

As historical methodologies become increasingly more inclusive it grows ever more unlikely that a single volume will, or could, ever include it all. Perhaps more significant than the lack of an epic novel or singular encyclopedic text, is the presence of intellectual veracity that prevents such a colossal topic from being contained in a solitary tome. In a work that explores this very issue, <i>Writing the Civil War: The Quest to Understand</i> (University of South Carolina, 1998) James McPherson and William Cooper make the following dedication: For All Participants in the Quest.

5667	9781621570837	$27.95	A LOOK AT LINCOLN: <br>Little Known Witnesses To History<br><i>Backstage at the Lincoln Assassination</i>		Bogar, Thomas A.			"
<p>
Abraham Lincoln’s murder on Good Friday, April 14, 1865, opened an ongoing wound.  It was America’s first presidential regicide.  Coming after four years of a brutal war and at the time of the restoration of peace as well as seeking reconciliation between North and South, Lincoln’s homicide seemed especially senseless.  Occurring just before Easter Sunday, it encouraged making Lincoln a saint akin to Jesus Christ, since some believed that it was punishment for the conflict and the institution of slavery which caused it.</p>
<p>
Many, historians and the public alike, have treated the Lincoln assassination as a subset to the epic story of the Civil War.  There have been, it is estimated, more than 2,000 books written on the assassination—out of a total of 16,000 written on Lincoln and 65,000 on the war—approximately one a day since the war ended.</p>
<p>
Few books have attempted to show how contemporary citizens responded to the crisis at the time and what their response suggests about the American character at the end of a rebellion that nearly toppled the nation.  Some Lincoln biographers devote only a few lines to this tragedy and hardly examine or acknowledge the change it made to the country.</p>
<p>
In 15 chapters plus an epilogue, this book, as if it were an <i>Upstairs, Downstairs</i> presentation, tells the story of 46 personalities of the Ford’s Theatre’s staff who were present and working at the time of the 10:15 p.m. assassination.  The author performs a splendid task in describing these individuals and their activities on this grim day and the atmosphere in Washington, with its shock, confusion and anger.</p>
<p>
In addition to many photographs of these personalities, including a map of the neighborhood printed between its covers, the volume is a docudrama with endnotes.  And the story is glibly told.  It is succinct, entertaining and informative with some overlap of the timeline in order to keep the reader from being confused.  The actions of Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, Judge Advocate General Joseph Holt, and Lafayette Baker intrude to intimidate and threaten staff and members of the cast by suggesting testimony—actually suborning perjury.</p>
<p>
This is a welcome addition to the Lincoln assassination story as little has been published about the cast and staff.  The stories are objectively told and one is left to form his or her own conclusion.  The assassination itself is not the focus here as the book concentrates on the players and their activities.</p>
<p>
For the assassination itself, one needs to turn to other volumes.  One of the best, if not the best, is Edward Steers, Jr.’s <i>Blood on the Moon: The Assassination of Abraham Lincoln</i> (University of Kentucky Press, 2001), which is the definitive account of Lincoln’s assassination.  Nor is it filled with misinformation such as the commercially successful <i>Killing Lincoln</i> by Bill O’Reilly and Martin Dugard.  Steers proves that the conspiracy theories involving Vice President Andrew Johnson and Secretary of War Stanton are totally unreliable but suggests that the Confederate government was aware of John Wilkes Booth’s schemes to kidnap Lincoln, if they did not directly support it.</p>
<p>
Richard Bak’s <i>The Day Lincoln Was Shot: An Illustrated Chronicle</i> (Taylor Publishing Company, 1998) includes excellent contributions by authors who are experts in their fields of the assassination.  William Hanchett wrote the chapter placing the assassination in context and Harold Holzer wrote the chapter containing background information about President Lincoln.  Richard E. Sloan discussed how Lincoln and the assassination has been portrayed in film.  The title of this book replicates Jim Bishop’s, which was the first book about the assassination that I read at the age of 12.  While Mr. Bishop has discounted the value of his <i>The Day Lincoln Was Shot</i> (Harper & Row, 1955 – reprinted in 2013) much still commends it as one of the best narratives of the events surrounding the assassination. Bishop’s well known style covers the period hour-by-hour, incorporating all of the characters involved.</p>
<p>
William Hanchett’s <i>The Lincoln Murder Conspiracy </i>(University of Illinois Press, 1983) successfully rebuts a broad conspiracy that went beyond John Wilkes Booth and his cohorts.  The allegations attempt to impugn Secretary of War Edwin Stanton.  This theory came from Otto Eisenschiml’s <i>Why Was Lincoln Murdered?</i> published in 1937.  His off-the-wall theory influenced many, including Jim Bishop in his <i>The Day Lincoln Was Shot</i> and continues to fascinate the public.  Hanchett completely disproves Eisenschiml’s allegations.</p>
<p>
Like Thomas A. Bogar’s Backstage at the Lincoln Assassination…, Thomas Goodrich’s <i>The Darkest Dawn</i> (Indiana University Press, 2005) organizes his book, not by the events, but by the key characters involved and the effect the assassination had on them as well as the public.</p>
<p>
Kate Larson Clifford, in her <i>The Assassination’s Accomplice, Mary Surratt, and the Plot to Kill Abraham Lincoln</i> (Basic Books, 2008), argues Mary Surratt was guilty and her death, by hanging, deserved.  Despite inexperienced attorneys and trial by a military commission with a foregone verdict, the author presents serious evidence against Mary Surratt, suggesting that the commission reached a correct result despite the many problems with the trial.</p>
<p>
<p>In one of the reports by someone who was present at Ford’s, Dr. Charles A. Leale’s <i>Lincoln’s Last Hours</i> (Kessinger Publishing, LLC, 2010) is the story of the army surgeon’s account of Lincoln’s fatal wound as he attended Lincoln immediately after the shooting.</p>
<p>
For historical fiction, James L. Swanson’s <i>Manhunt: The 12-Day Chase For Lincoln’s Killer</i> (HarperCollins Publishers, 2006) is a must read.  It is as good as you can get and close to Pulitzer Prize winning <i>The Killer Angels </i>by Michael Shaara.  <i>Manhunt</i> is a narrative by those who sought Booth as well as from Booth and David Herold who were the hunted.</p>
<p>
The contemporary account by Louis J. Weichmann in <i>The True History of the Assassination of Abraham Lincoln and of the Conspiracy of 1865</i>, edited by Floyd E. Risvold (Alfred A. Knopf, New York 1975), represents the tragic drama of the person who consorted with at least 11 of the characters believed to be involved in the plot to either kidnap or murder Lincoln.  Louis Weichmann resided in Mary Surratt’s Washington boarding house with the conspirators and was the primary witness for the government against the conspirators.  Weichmann remains controversial to this day, with many challenging his credulity and testimony that led to the conviction of Dr. Samuel A. Mudd and the conviction and execution of Mary Surratt.</p>
<p>
And nothing equals Michael Kaufman’s <i>American Brutus: John Wilkes Booth and the Lincoln Conspiracies</i> (Random Hopuse, 2005) in describing and understanding John Wilkes Booth.</p>
<p>
All these works, including <i>Backstage at the Lincoln Assassination</i>…, help place this horrific event within the context of the tumultuous times in which it occurred, and depicts its momentous dimensions.  It’s a fresh contribution to the Lincoln assassination literature.</p>

6309			Civil War Treasures: <br>English Satire on the American Civil War from the Pages of <i>Punch</i>		Rasmussen, Hans	Taylor, Michael		"
<p><i>Punch, or the London Charivari</i>, a justly famous British weekly satirical magazine established in 1841, had become a national institution by the time the American Civil War began.  Its brilliant writers and cartoonists naturally made sport of the politics of the war, casting their witty and disparaging opinions on issues like slavery, secession, Anglo-American diplomacy, wartime economics, and Union fortunes on the battlefield.  The LSU Libraries Special Collections holds original issues of <i>Punch</i> for the years 1861-1863, affording an amusing glimpse of how English opinion makers interpreted and encouraged others to view the American Civil War.
<p>Even before the war began, the writers of <i>Punch</i> were positively prescient about its outcome.  As soon as South Carolina seceded from the union, they predicted that a war begun to preserve slavery would counterintuitively result in emancipation, a viewpoint expressed in the opening lines of a satirical poem:</p>

<blockquote>
Secede, ye Southern States, secede,<br/>
No better plan could be,<br/>
If you of Niggers would be freed,<br/>
To set your Niggers free.<sup>1</sup></blockquote>

<p>Their bafflement over why southerners would leave the union and foolishly forfeit the benefit of the fugitive slave act commenced the magazine’s wholehearted condemnation of slavery in the South, a position consistent with the majority opinion in Britain.  Their abolitionist attitude dominated all references to American politics before the war, such as a particularly biting ditty sung to the tune of <i>Rule Britannia</i> that ended each stanza with “Rule Slaveownia, Slaveownia rules, and raves / “Christians ever, ever, ever shall have slaves.”<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Once hostilities began, however, the thrust of <i>Punch’s</i> satire switched from condemning slavery to ridiculing the United States, whose earlier pretensions of international ambition, expressed particularly through the Monroe Doctrine, had completely disintegrated owing to its current troubles.  For instance, one song published barely a fortnight after Fort Sumter snickered at the nation’s inability to answer Spanish colonial encroachment in Santo Domingo.  Another a month later laughed at the folly of engaging in a civil war and ridiculed the poor judgment of the American people:</p>

<blockquote>
And here you are about to fight,<br/>
And wage intestine war,<br/>
Not either of you in the right:<br/>
What simpletons you are!<sup>3</sup></blockquote>

<p><i>Punch</i> didn’t hesitate to mock the Yankees after their resounding defeat at First Manassas, publishing a ten stanza poem and full-page cartoon using the defeat as proof of the feebleness of the claim that the Unites States might seize Canada out of anger over Britain’s official declaration of neutrality in May 1861.  In subsequent months, they scoffed at the idea that Britons would loan money to the United States to put down the rebellion: “You’ll spend all you borrow in powder and ball, / And then have to show for it—nothing at all.”  A cartoon later that year suggested British textile manufacturers would buy cotton from India if they couldn’t get any from the United States, depicting a frustrated John Bull angrily declaring, “Oh! If you two like fighting better than business, I shall deal at the other shop.”<sup>4</sup></p>

<p>Not surprisingly, the Trent Affair of November-December 1861 evoked passionate scorn from patriotic English satirists:</p>

<blockquote>
Your passion and arrogance, JONATHAN, bridle,<br/>
And let me know what you call MASON and SLIDELL.<br/>
Are they rebels?  What right, if you take that position,<br/>
Had you, boarding the <i>Trent</i>, to demand extradition?</blockquote>

<p>They turned the tables by interrogating if the Americans would have objected if Britain had seized John Mitchel and Thomas Francis Meagher, two escaped Irish revolutionaries then living in the United States.<sup>5</sup> Several cartoons  illustrated the anxiety over the possibility for war between the two countries before the crisis was resolved, as well as the smugness felt over this British diplomatic victory.  A song sung to the tune of <i>Yankee Doodle</i> expressed this joy at bettering an upstart nation in a tight predicament: </p>

<blockquote>
ROWDY DOODLE is in wrath,<br/>
And would on us have poured it;<br/>
But war’s so dear a luxury,<br/>
He can’t just now afford it.<br/>
He owns that he would much enjoy<br/>
The Britishers to lick, Sir:<br/>
But now, alas! He’s so hard up,<br/>
He cannot buy the stick,Sir!<sup>6</sup></blockquote>

<p>Once the Trent Affair had passed, <i>Punch’s</i> satirical aim returned to a broad ridicule of the war’s political, moral, and especially economic futility, as well as a mockery of Lincoln’s inability to crush the rebellion in the months before Antietam.<sup>7</sup>  The Emancipation Proclamation, rather than being welcomed as a long-awaited instrument of liberation, was satirized in cartoon and verse as “Abe Lincoln’s Last Card,” a desperate measure that failed to meet Britons’ hopes for truly national emancipation:</p>

<blockquote>
From the Slaves of Southern rebels<br/>
Thus I strike the chain:<br/>
But the slaves of loyal owners<br/>
Still shall slaves remain.<sup>8</sup></blockquote>

<p>Lincoln’s quandary over how to deal with the tenacious issue of slavery that had challenged every previous president wasn’t lost on <i>Punch</i>, who well knew of previous ideas and schemes for abolition that had failed in the United States.  The Emancipation Proclamation’s inability to actually free slaves in rebellious states and the dilemma of continued enslavement in the “Border States, that’s neither flesh nor fish” all conspired to paint a picture of a ridiculously weak and ineffective president in early 1863.<sup>9</sup>  Despite these shortcomings in the Union’s conduct of the war, <i>Punch</i> approved of arming freedmen and condemned the New York City draft riots of 1863.<sup>10</sup></p>



<p>Whatever its opinion of Americans north or south, <i>Punch’s</i> writers and artists never made an issue of British neutrality, decidedly insisting that Britons wanted no part in the American war.  Although they never ceased in their principled sympathy for slaves and freedmen, the Civil War was also critically an economic issue, a matter of grain imports, loans, investments, and the cotton trade.  Thus, they imagined John Bull as a merchant explaining “to his American bullies” that “Into your confounded quarrel / Let myself be dragged I’ll not,” because “What I want to do with either / Is impartially to trade.”<sup>11</sup>  Mid-Victorian Britain was a manufacturing dynamo for which the American Civil War proved to be only a nonsensical nuisance.<br/></p>

6243			Civil War Treasures: <br>Serving Two Masters in the Election of 1876		Rasmussen, Hans			"
<p>As our presidential election ferociously thunders on into the summer and autumn, the uncompromising, partisan nature of modern American politics of which commentators and pundits constantly bemoan continues to cast a depressing cloud of hopelessness over the nation.  But rather than curse the darkness, the LSU Libraries Special Collections prefers to spotlight two treasures that together tell a more hopeful story of civic virtue, a tale of two musicians crossing the political divide during the famously contentious presidential election of 1876.  The competing campaign songs “We'll Blow Our Horn for Hayes” and “Gov. Tilden is Our Man” stand out from the rest of the political music of the time not just because they were issued by the same publisher and purchased from the same New Orleans music store, but because both songs were written and composed <i>by the same guys!</i><sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Until the mid-twentieth century, music specially written to honor candidates was a staple of presidential campaigns, and the election of 1876 certainly was no exception.  Its most prolific lyricist was Samuel N. Mitchell (1846-1905), an extraordinarily productive (if poorly remunerated) songwriter during the 1870s who became famous for writing sentimental ballads, especially the tremendously popular <a href=""https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/handle/1774.2/5174"">“Just Touch the Harp Gently, My Pretty Louise”</a> (1870).  A veteran of the 11th Rhode Island Infantry Regiment during the Civil War, Mitchell ultimately penned some 600 songs in his lifetime, including <a href=""http://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/uva-lib:1139890/view"">“We Deck Their Graves Alike Today”</a> (1877), which became a standard hymn for Memorial Day ceremonies.<sup>2</sup>  He wrote the lyrics to five songs for the election of 1876: three honoring Rutherford B. Hayes and two celebrating Samuel J. Tilden.  Mitchell was joined on three of these by the equally ambivalent composer Charles Edward Prior (1856-1927), an amateur musician from Jewett City, Connecticut, who at the time was employed primarily as a bookkeeper and paymaster for a cotton goods manufacturer and as an organist at the local Congregational Church.<sup>3</sup></p>

<p>Bouncing, boisterous, but never particularly creative, these Mitchell and Prior collaborations aimed to rally the troops with cheers for the candidate’s impeccable character and enthusiastic (if decidedly unspecific) predictions of success when in office.  Their tunes for Hayes both celebrated the general’s war record and encouraged Republicans to get voters to the polls.  <a href=""https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/handle/1774.2/16435"">“Hayes and Wheeler are Our Choice”</a> tried to quell any doubts among the faithful because “Hayes and Wheeler are a team, That will be hard to beat, And folly ‘tis to even dream, Or think of their defeat.”<sup>4</sup>  <a href=""https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/handle/1774.2/12397"">“We’ll Blow Our Horn for Hayes”</a> became quite a popular piece that reportedly sold 1,700 copies in three days, notwithstanding its rather flat lyrics and drinking song chorus: “We’ll give our votes to Rutherford, We’ll blow our horn for Hayes, And in the White House he will live A portion of his days.”<sup>5</sup>  <a href=""https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/handle/1774.2/6470"">“Gov. Tilden is Our Man”</a> likewise strove to inspire Democratic supporters with bland character affirmations (“Gov’nor Tilden has a mind of the good old fashioned kind”) and broad campaign promises (“He will put an end to ‘rings’ and the other naughty things, That cast such dreadful shame upon the land”).<sup>6</sup></p>

<p>Samuel Mitchell teamed up with other composers for two more campaign songs in 1876.  <a href=""https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/handle/1774.2/10853"">“The Boys in Blue Will See It Through,”</a> which we wrote with Hart P. Danks, apparently sought the votes of Union veterans despite making only the vaguest of references to the Civil War.  Here only the Democrats were the enemy and they would be defeated by good soldiers from all the sections of the nation: “The North and South, the East and West Will rally to the front, And all will do their very best To make the ‘Demmies’ grunt.”<sup>7</sup>  <a href=""https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/handle/1774.2/18929"">“The Times Are Sadly Out of Joint,”</a> which Mitchell wrote with composer H.A. Selington, clearly was his most creative work of the campaign with a message of class struggle that outshone his usual party fight song repertoire.  A pro-Tilden ballad emphasizing the suffering of the poor during the Panic of 1873, it cut at the Republicans with references to Grant-era corruption while waxing in selective (albeit apologetic) nostalgia for William “Boss” Tweed, at the time a prison escapee and fugitive from the law: “Now that the old man’s on the wing, We state this as quite sure, Though he was boss of a bad ring, He did not hate the poor.”<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>So why did these two men compose for both sides in the election?  In a word—money.  Mitchell complained into middle age of how little he made from his songs and how others profited handsomely from them, estimating he earned no more than $7,000 from all his 600 works while others grew rich, even by outright theft.  By his mid-forties he was reduced to working as a mailing clerk for the <i>Pawtucket Evening Times</i>, resigned never to write ballads again.  Although Prior would go on to a successful career in banking and fame as a compiler of Sunday School singing books, in 1876 he was twenty years old and struggling as a bookkeeper and church organist with a new bride to support.  Whatever their personal political views—Prior later would describe himself ironically as “a Republican with independent tendencies”—the need to support themselves and their families clearly settled any qualms over party loyalty, creative contradiction, or the naggings of conscience.<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>While nineteenth-century journalism infamously exhibited a bald-faced partisanship, political songwriting apparently was a more mercenary endeavor.  After all, Mitchell and Prior were not the only songwriters playing for both teams during the 1876 election.  The German-born composer Edward Mack wrote four marches for Hayes and one for Tilden.  A musician named R. Goerdeler likewise wrote marches for both candidates.  Phil P. Keil arranged the “Tilden and Hendricks Polka,” as well as writing the music for the “Hayes and Wheeler Polka.”<sup>10</sup>  Samuel Mitchell’s sometime collaborator, Hart P. Danks, showed a Republican partiality by writing songs for Grant, Hayes, Harrison, and the Union dead, but he broke ranks to compose for Winfield Scott Hancock in 1880, proving that even seemingly loyal musicians could be lured away for ready cash.<sup>11</sup></p>
<p>Mitchell and Prior paired up one other time that year for “If Washington Was Living Now,” a positively painful song for the nation’s centennial that was panned for being too hokey even for its time.  After quoting some of its awful verse imagining the first president approving modern American progress, one reviewer complained, “The writer of this is probably not a poet highly gifted with fancy and imagination, but he is able to rhyme … He merely ground out his verses; and as his mill was a poor one, the verses were not only without feeling, but in ridiculously bad taste, not to say nonsensical.”<sup>12</sup>  In the end, the election of 1876 would be the only campaign to inspire the mediocre words and melodies of these two decidedly independent musicians.  Neither Samuel Mitchell nor Charles Prior ever wrote another presidential campaign song again.</p>

5592			CIVIL WAR TREASURES:<br>Wanderers Among the Ruins: A Southern Family’s Life in England during the Civil War		Taylor, Michael			"<br>
<p>
A prosperous Louisiana planter like George Otis Hall normally would have spent the month of February attending to his new sugar crop. In February 1862, however, Hall found himself not on the banks of the Mississippi, but on the banks of the River Wye, a broad, placid stream that forms the border between England and Wales. Near its mouth sit the stately ruins of Tintern Abbey, left to crumble since the dissolution of the monasteries in the reign of King Henry VIII. The whole scene had inspired one of Wordsworth’s most famous poems. “Five years have past; five summers, with the length of five long winters! and again I hear these waters,"" the poet had written, reflecting on how much his life had changed since first visiting the area a few years earlier. Hall, too, would find himself in very different circumstances before he saw the Mississippi again, and as he wandered over the grounds of the abbey, or, a few days later, among the megaliths at Stonehenge (a site that carried his thoughts back “into the distant and undefined past""), little could he have known that a scene of devastation awaited him at home that rivaled the ruins of ancient Britain, if not in romance, then certainly in sorrow and desolation.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>

In our “treasures"" column this month, we feature several letters, now held by the LSU Libraries Special Collections, in which Hall recorded his experiences abroad during the Civil War.</p>
<p>

Born in South Carolina in 1809, he had spent his formative years in England before re-crossing the Atlantic, going into business in New Orleans, and then purchasing a sugar plantation, Magnolia Mound, on what was then the outskirts of Baton Rouge. A devout Catholic, he enrolled his eldest son George at Stonyhurst College, England’s largest and finest Catholic preparatory school, in 1857. Located about fifty miles from Liverpool, Stonyhurst was an outgrowth of the College of Saint Omer in France, founded by Jesuits in the sixteenth century to educate expatriate English Catholics. Several prominent American Catholics were educated at Saint Omer in the eighteenth century, and after Stonyhurst opened its doors in 1794, it too attracted students from “across the pond."" At the time of the Civil War, at least three Louisianans were enrolled there.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>

Despite the school’s reputation for excellence, Hall worried about his son’s progress, lecturing him at one point that “You are now more than thirteen years old and ought to think a little of more serious matters than cricket and football.""<sup>3</sup> In the spring of 1861, he decided to pay him a visit, along with his wife and other children, who were already in England. The political crisis between North and South was nearing its breaking point at the time of Hall’s departure, and it was while he and his family were in London that news reached them of the attack on Fort Sumter and the beginning of the Civil War. “It is a most unfortunate state of things and will doubtless lead to deplorable results for us all,"" Hall wrote gloomily to his son at Stonyhurst.<sup>4</sup> Not long afterwards, he recorded that “things are taking a very serious turn in America and in all probability our unhappy country will be involved in a civil war for many years to come... [U]nder any aspect we may take of it, it cannot fail to prove highly disastrous to our as well as all other interests in America.""<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>

Although he had intended to return to Louisiana at summer’s end, Hall discovered that the Union blockade had locked him out of his own country. Even sailing to Canada would not have solved the problem, according to Hall. “I was to have embarked on Thursday last for America and was all ready and packed up,"" he wrote in September 1861, “when we got advices that Southerners were not allowed to pass over the frontiers of Canada without taking the oath of allegiance to the Washington government and with a passport.""<sup>6</sup> The only other option was a long overland journey through Mexico and Texas, which Hall decided was too risky.<sup>7</sup> For the time being, he would have to remain in England.</p>
<p> 

It would turn out to be a long wait. News arrived in the summer of 1862 that Baton Rouge had fallen to Federal forces. At Magnolia Mound, Union soldiers had “committed all kind of depredations, wantonly destroying what they could not use or carry away,"" including Hall’s library and paintings.<sup>8</sup> At one point, he gave vent to his suspicions that the war was being waged partly as an anti-Catholic crusade. “These northern fanatics are always mouthing about civil and religious liberty,"" he wrote, “yet they tolerate neither. They burnt some years ago, as you know, the convents at Boston and the Catholic Churches at Philadelphia, etc. What would the Catholic signers of the Declaration of Independence, among whom was Charles Carroll of Carrollton, think of the present state of things.""<sup>9</sup> The parallel to the destruction of the abbeys three centuries earlier in England must at least have crossed his mind.</p>
<p>

Newspapers carried nothing to suggest the war would come to an end anytime soon, and although Hall had transferred much of his wealth to London banks, he worried about his financial situation. In January 1862, George received a note from his father instructing him to economize. Fencing, dancing, gymnastics, and music lessons would have to be put off “until more propitious times.""<sup>10</sup> Hall had enrolled two of his daughters at the Convent of the Sacred Heart at Roehampton (later attended by English actress Vivien Leigh, star of <i>Gone with the Wind</i>), but then pulled them out to save money. Things had gotten so bad by the spring of 1863 that Hall decided to withdraw George, too, from classes and either transfer him to a school on the Continent, where tuition was cheaper, or find him a job in his uncle Lindsay’s office in Liverpool.<sup>11</sup> When George complained, his father wrote back, “I am afraid you have not realized the position of things. Our property is all devastated and we are shut off from all resources, if indeed any at all will be left to us after the war.""<sup>12</sup></p>
<p>

George arrived in Liverpool in August and worked with his uncle for a few months before receiving word that his family was moving to Belgium “from motives of economy.""<sup>13</sup> Realizing that George needed another year of schooling (mostly to perfect his French), Hall enrolled him at a college in Melle, near Ghent. He would spend the rest of the war there, completing his studies in 1865. Hall himself waited out the latter part of the war in Brussels before sailing for New Orleans in December 1864. When he arrived in Baton Rouge in January, the destruction was as bad as he had expected.<sup>14</sup> He described it in a long letter to his wife, then picked up the pieces as best as he could, selling off many household items and finding a tenant to lease Magnolia Mound before getting rid of it altogether in 1869. By June, he was back in Brussels and would spend the rest of his life in Europe, dying in Paris in 1880. His son George eventually made his way to California, while his daughters remained in France, where several Hall family descendants can still be found today.</p>
<p>

The Civil War, it has been said, was fought in ten thousand places. It was felt, however, in many more, and even Americans who lived an ocean away could not escape its effects.</p>

2958			<b>REDISCOVERING CIVIL WAR CLASSICS: <p>THROUGH THE EYES OF CIVIL WAR PHOTOGRAPHERS</b>		Madden, David			<br><br><p>Up front: I am on a crusade, now in its tenth year, to bombard the ramparts of the Professional Civil War Historians Establishment to win proper recognition of photographers, artists, and mapmakers.</p><p>Later columns will deal with artists and mapmakers. The focus of this column is photographers.</p> <p>First, let us now rediscover and praise a few individual photographers. This is also yet another opportunity to praise the late Hayward Cirker for his heroic Dover reprint publications of the work of four key Civil War photographers.</p> <p>In his introduction to the 1959 Dover Publications reprint, E. F. Bleiler staked out a claim for Alexander Gardner's <i>Photographic Sketchbook of the Civil War</i>, published in Washington, D. C. in 1866, as the first published collection of Civil War photographs. I first saw this collection in Abraham Lincoln's house in Springfield, Illinois during the bi-centennial year, 1976. It was one inspiration of my Civil War novel, <i>Sharpshooter</i>, started a decade later. Gardner does not inform us that the image that became so famous that it may be seen enormously enlarged at the scene--the Rebel sharpshooter dead in Devil's Den, Gettysburg--was taken by Timothy O'Sullivan. It haunts my novel. To see what Gardner saw, look at two images in particular:  In the most impressive battlefield image of President Lincoln, we see him towering over General McClellan, little Napoleon, and a gathering of officers of varying height at Antietam. Another image shows the little U. S. Arsenal town of Harper's Ferry, where John Brown made his last stand; it is one of the most exotic villages on earth.</p><p>As an enhancement to Gardner's own book, I also recommend the recent <i>Witness to An Era: The Life and Photographs of Alexander Gardner</i> by D. Mark Katz.</p><p>In 1977, Cirker reprinted George N. Barnard's <i>Photographic Views of Sherman's Campaign</i>, also first published, privately, in 1866. In his preface, Beaumont Newhall, one of the great photography historians, called the book a landmark of the history of photography. I imagine he would have said the same about Gardner's book.</p> <p>Barnard's views seem as if they are seen by an omniscient eye, as in a panoramic series of my own hometown Knoxville from the cupola of my Alma Mater (not included in the book). Seen first by a man, Barnard, the views of The Destruction of Hood's Ordnance Train (plate 44) and Rebel Works in Front of Atlanta, Ga., no. 1 (plate 39) become omniscient views such as men in war never saw, not evenùmindful of the photograph's contemplative aspect--generals. This effect is ruined by severe cropping in most books.</p> <p>In 1974, Cirker reprinted Roy Meredith's revised 1946 <i>Mr. Lincoln's Camera Man: Mathew B. Brady</i>, a distinctive feature of which is Brady's Lantern Slide Lecture Book, consisting of his notes and of his choice of 135 photographs that he claimed him and his operatives took during the war. He died before he could give that lecture. Taking on the role of Brady, I have given his lecture myself, with slides, twice and intend to repeat the performance at every opportunity.</p> <p>One of the photographs Brady seems to claim is a Barnard-like view. The feeling of omniscient detachment, perspective is very keen in a view of the garrison at Johnsonville, just as Thomas is pulling a federal battery out of there to go up against Hood at Nashville. It is shot from such an odd height, suggesting no man-made structure for tripod support, that I feel an omniscient eye gazes upon these men and caissons as they stand on wet surfaces, and General Forrest's entire career rushes in to my mind's eye, for he assaulted this place like a natural force a month before this evacuation. Unable to imagine a human eye looking through a lens to produce this view, I feel a shiver, as if an All-Seeing Eye is looking over my shoulder.</p> <p>One of the most moving photographs of a Civil War general is the one of General Robert E. Lee, standing in the rear of his house in April after the surrender, his hat in his hand, looking into Brady's hooded eyes.</p><p>In 1982, Cirker, rediscoverer and reprinter of Civil War photographs, published a fresh collection, <i>Russell's Civil War Photographs: 116 Historic Prints by Andrew J. Russell</i>, with a preface by Joe Buberger and Matthew Isenberg, who had purchased an album found in an old chest. Brady had published several Russell photographs as his own, some cropped, but others were seen for the first time, uncropped, in their original form. The views of the Richmond ruins may remind some viewers of Dresden or Berlin.</p> <p>All four of Cirker's Dover Publications are in print.</p><p>Not in print is James D. Horan's <i>Timothy O'Sullivan: America's Forgotten Photographer</i> (1966), the first rediscovery of the work of another major Civil War photographer; he later took some of the most powerful images of the frontiers of the west. His photograph of three Confederate prisoners has often been misused; for instance, they are sometimes offered as stalwart examples of fierce Southern manhood, determined to fight to the death. Among my favorites, are the three views, probably shot from Massaponax church belfry, of Grant: he is seated on a church bench outside among officers, then moves behind Meade to look at a map, then sits again. One of the most powerful semi-posed portraits of the war shows Alfred Waud sitting on a rock, sketching, probably a Devil's Den scene. Horan cropped it, however. Comparison of an execution by hanging with the same shot in Katz's book about Gardner, cited above, suggests that the one in Horan is cropped; comparison of the dead rebel sharpshooter in Devil's Den in Horan with Gardner's clearly shows that one of the most famous photographs of the war has been insensitively cropped. Set aside for the moment the fact that Gardner and O'Sullivan, perhaps with the aid of Alfred Waud, posed this shot by moving the body, which is seen in other photographs in a different place and posture nearby.</p> <p>Also not in print is one of the earliest and best of the pictorial histories of the war, <i>Divided We Fought</i> (1956: New York, The Macmillan Company), with text by the General Editor, David Donald, a now famous historian and biographer. The names of the picture editors, Hirst D. Milhollen and Milton Kaplan, and the caption editors, Milhollen, Kaplan, and Hulen Stuart appear prominently on the title page; as is typical, picture credits are not given with each photograph but are relegated to the back. Not much has changed in that regard in the half century since. Unfortunately, this book has many of the faults I will cite below, but I know of few books that do not.</p> <p>I hope to see, someday, the publication of a collection of a hundred great photographs, with only the name, subject, place, and date, and an introduction about the works as documentary art. The photos I cite above are among my choices of the greatest and I would be glad to see them in the environment of such a collection.</p><p>A general observation before returning to my crusade theme. Because the North's industrial capacity was far greater than the South's for waging war, there was an ever-increasing scarcity of photographic materials. Thus, no book can illustrate the Civil War in a balanced way. Beginning with titles, most books are less histories of the Civil War than of the North's battle with the South. There is no good reason why Civil War histories should not be read and looked at in that light--and in that light, many are magnificent--James McPherson's illustrated edition of <i>The Battle Cry Of Freedom</i>, discussed in my previous column, for instance. I am glad to stress the fact that he seems to have made a deliberate effort to balance the number of Southern and Northern images, especially during that time late in the war when the South was far less able to produce them.</p> <p>A glaring indication of the problem is that some of the best pictorials cite no photographers' names at all, but cite, at the end, only the sources of the prints used. When a photograph is stretched over the gully between two pages, distortion is always the effect. Photographs are often treated as mere decoration, or for other purely utilitarian purposes. Cropping is a major abuse committed against artists and photographers. There are many instances of the pernicious use of a photograph taken in one place to give an impression of an event in another.</p> <p> The naming of photographers is sometimes erratic. The most diligent and dedicated research may never discover the names of some of the photographers whose work appears in great number; but it may be possible to dig deep enough to discover many of them. In many books, we are told that this is the famous photograph of Lincoln and McClellan in a tent, but not the name of its creator, Alexander Gardner, one of the most famous photographers. The scholar's task is complicated by the fact that this and other photographs are often erroneously attributed to Mathew Brady. But such confusion is as much a part of history as the confusion in battles that historians devote much time to clarifying. Ironically, the historian asks the reader to see the battle of Gettysburg, for instance, through his or her eyesùa battle seen in the immediate aftermath by the photographer whose vision embellishes the historian's vision. When research leaves no other alternative, when no name is found, the phrase photographer unknown or photographer apparently unknown should be used. If a photographer seems to be unknown, dedicated and diligent research may discover a name.</p> <p>My contention is that no history is complete without basic, in-text documentation of every photograph, map, drawing, and painting; and an ongoing account of the active role played by named mapmakers, artists, and photographers. I know of no historian writing a history of the war in general--as opposed to a few who have written a history of art and photography in the war--who has made a conscientious effort to research the names of artists and photographers and the names of the people in the photographs for the purpose of including them as a declared major, integral part of the history of the Civil War. The direct involvement in the war of Mathew Brady, Alexander Gardner, George N. Barnard, Timothy O'Sullivan, Andrew J. Russell, and Andrew Lytle was quite often not only colorful but meaningful.</p><p>Given my effort over the past decade to exhort historians to give credit for pictorial documents with the same scrupulosity with which they give credit to other historians and for written documents, my lament is not for lack of scholarly thoroughness but for lack of a corrective declaration and demonstration to the general reader of the vital role artists and photographers played during the war and the woefully unacknowledged service their work has performed. Their works are simultaneously records of fact as documents and inspirationsùinspiration in the sense that the impact of these images has played a major part in arousing and sustaining the public's interest in the war and in moving many historians to write about it in the first place, as they themselves have sometimes testified.</p> <p>Given the evidence in those Civil War histories, including many that are primarily pictorials, and even some books on individual photographers and artists, professional historians have not yet set high standards for the useùto avoid the misuse and abuseùof illustrations. At present then, we should not reproach historians for failing, overall or in part, to meet an as-yet undeclared standard. But we should indeed challenge them to set that standard as one all others can agree to adopt at the very next meeting of the Society of Civil War Historians.</p> <p>The so-called Brady photographs are at the heart of the vortex of confusion now almost 150 years old over the question of attribution. He claimed photographs he did not himself take, not only those taken by his operatives, but also photographs taken by Russell and others who were not associated with him. Some historians have followed Brady and have added to the problem by misidentifying him as the photographer of pictures others took.Meredith made mistakes, some of which James D. Horan quietly corrected in his 1955 book, <i>Mathew Brady: Historian with a Camera</i>. In 1997, Mary Panzer's <i>Mathew Brady and the Image of History</i> (Smithsonian Press) provided us with one of the most reliable sources for dealing with the Brady problem. Three years later, a very popular book on Brady by the late, myriad minded historian, Webb Garrison, <i>Brady's Civil War</i>, agitated the vortex all over again. It is a casebook for many of the misuses and abuses I note in this column. I trust Garrison, who only wrote the brief text, mostly captions. I recommended him for this project, which proved to be his last.</p><p>Again, these transgressions are not violations of a universally agreed upon prerequisite for writing a quality history of the war, failure to meet a standard that has not yet been set by the profession or demanded by the American reader, but we can justly expect historians in future printings and in new works to correct omissions where the names are known or may be discovered. Many books are important enough to deserve an ongoing reaching for perfection. Historians of the future will, one hopes, weave into the main text throughout a narrative and description of the crucial role of artists and photographers. Space routinely given over to the mere naming of many officers in a given battle could be devoted instead, or as well, to artists and photographers. Ironically, credit is given to the archive from which the photograph was secured but not to the photographer. Archives should demand that credit to the photographer be given.  Campaign to give these men frontline status is long overdue.</p><p>The more direct importance we give to making the photographer who aimed his camera seem as real as we try to make the soldier or officer who aimed his rifle the more we are moved to imagine how the battle looked to the photographer as he waited for the smoke to clear so his lens and his plate could capture it in the long exposure. When we look at a photograph we do well to imagine the photographer's total act of seeingùthe cruel radiance of what <i>is</i>-- not just the one he developed in his hooded wagon. All Civil War photographs are documents, yes, but as we approach the sesqui-centennial our perceptions of them should rise to that level of art where respect must be paid. We should not only see, but imagine, the photographs, we should stare at, gaze into, meditate on photographs, until the images are made as much in your brain pan as in the original developing solutions, that painstaking process.</p><p><i>David Madden is founding director of the United States Civil War Center and founder of the</i> Civil War Book Review. <i>He is the author of the Civil War novel</i> Sharpshooter <i>and co-editor of</i> Classics of Civil War Fiction <i>and of a series of the same name with the University of Alabama Press.

2302			REDISCOVERING CIVIL WAR CLASSICS:<p>The saga of technology		Madden, David			<br>Have you ever crawled inside a defunct forge and imagined working in that hell-hot, narrow space, glancing up at the sun struggling to penetrate the smoke hole, like the mouth of a cannon? I'll never forget standing briefly inside the Great Western Furnace on the Land Between the Rivers in Tennessee.<p>The Civil War was ironclad in more ways than one. North and South, veins of iron held the Union and the Confederacy together---and ripped them apart. Within the South itself, iron from the North clashed with iron forged within the Confederacy. The romance of battle has lured historians into retelling the stories of the leaders, without ever noticing that victories and defeats in each battle derived from the pervasive uses of iron---in railroads, ships, rifles---and other forged or smelted metals. <p>The story of technology in the Civil War has yet to be told in all its awesomeness. General impressions of its severe limitations to the contrary, the South was not separate from but a part of that story, and Tredegar Iron Works in the capital of the Confederacy stands as a symbol of what the South's industrial might actually was and what it so desperately needed to be. <p>We have Charles B. Dew, professor of history at Williams College, to thank for presenting the story of Tredegar Iron Works. The reprinting of Dew's <b>Ironmaker to the Confederacy</b>, 43 years after its original publication, is both a blessing and a reminder that historians have woefully neglected this essential, awesome aspect of the War---as indeed they have neglected many other aspects in favor of an endless parade of generals and battles.<p>Tredegar is the lightning rod for those few who feel the electric charge, radiating out over the landscapes of military campaigns, into the armies and their battles. Like constellations orbiting Tredegar are the lesser-known iron works and the many forges located throughout the hills and mountains of the South. For instance, <i>The Civil War in Appalachia</i> includes an essay on other southern industrial works, in Appalachia of all places, suggesting the scope and unexamined aspects of the fuller story.<p>As an isolated case, the story of entrepreneur Joseph R. Anderson and his Tredegar Iron Works is magnificent. To adapt Dew's phrases in the table of contents, it is a story of politics, prices, and profits; of the trials of production with limited resources; of slaves, labor details, conscripts, and aliens (We must have hands!); of running the Yankee blockade; of arming the South with cannons for Lee and other generals; of declining output; of pardon and restoration in the Reconstruction era (Back to business). <p>Tables and figures are obligatory for such a study, and Dew obliges us. Brady's photographs of the ruins of industry in Richmond are key images of the War. An appendix lists the types of ordnance cast at Tredegar, from field artillery, to siege and  seacoast artillery, to naval ordnance. The analytical index is another enticing feature of Dew's achievement. An excellent bibliographical essay delineates the foundation for the heroic task of taking the story further. A thorough history of the Southern iron industry during the nineteenth century, Dew admonishes us, is badly needed.<p><b>Ironmaker to the Confederacy</b> is a virtual museum. About six years ago, I tried to persuade the family that still owns Tredegar to create a real one; meanwhile, a virtual one on the Web is a doable venture. Not only engineers would make repeated hits upon it, but so would scientists in other disciplines that were involved in the war effort.<p>The reissue of Dew's book suggests that we are given a second chance now to imagine the many possibilities for varied perspectives on technology in the South during its antebellum, war, and reconstruction periods. Between the first appearance of his groundbreaking study and its reprinting, Dew himself looked at the story of iron from another perspective in the magisterial <i>Bond of Iron: Master and Slave at Buffalo Forge</i>.<p>Allow me to offer one general recommendation. Following Dew's exemplary lead, an historian with an interdisciplinary intellect and sensibility might undertake a myriad-minded overview of the many ways traditional and innovative technology played decisive roles in specific battles and other venues of the conduct of the War. Such a work would weave together a technological survey, written in a lively style, fit for human emotional, imaginative, and intellectual consumption. Among the firsts, North and South, were the machine gun (not used until 1866), hand grenades, telescopic sights for rifles, repeating rifles, balloons, ironclad vessels, and electronically-exploded bombs and torpedoes.<p>Perhaps initially, the focus should be the South, because the outline of technological enterprise is starker there and could serve as an easily apprehensible model for such studies. A humanistic dimension would be to stitch into the factual tapestry the stories of the workers and their families, and their relationships to soldiers from their towns and environs. A model for that kind of multifaceted focus is Daniel E. Sutherland's <i>Seasons of War</i>. The University of Tennessee Press, which has focused our attention upon the work of the combat engineers who put technology and industry into action, serves as an example to other publishers, encouraging them to rise above the clash of iron and steel in battles to dwell a while upon the saga of technology. <p><i>As founding director of the United States Civil War Center, David Madden conceived</i> Civil War Book Review. <i>He is editor of</i> Beyond the Battlefield (2000) <i>and</i> The Legacy of Robert Penn Warren (2000)<i>, and author of the Civil War novel</i> Sharpshooter (1996). <i>Among his current projects are</i> Letters from Soldiers: The Civil War and Myriadmindedness<i>, which delineates a major advance in human learning.</i>		Winter 2001	2000-12-01	Classics								"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=226 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/DewIronmaker.jpg"">"						
2300			REDISCOVERING CIVIL WAR CLASSICS:<p>The Story of Don Miff: A Symphony of Life		Dabney, Virginius			"<br>Here comes one Civil War novel after another - and you wish something new would come along. Well, here it is: <b>The Story of Don Miff, As Told by His Friend, John Bouche Whacker, A Symphony of Life</b>, ""edited"" by Virginius Dabney. The title makes you think you know what you're in for but what you get is something you'd never dream of. New in what way, you do well to ask. New in conception and execution. <b>Don Miff</b> was then -- and remains -- unique, in Southern, indeed American, fiction. <b>Don Miff</b> is more like <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> on the right hand and <i>Tristram Shandy</i> on the left than like <i>The Killer Angels</i> or <i>Cold Mountain</i>. <p>If any American were to conceive of a satirical Civil War novel 20 years after Appomattox, it would be one by an independent-minded Virginian living in New York City. If ever a subject needed a dose of Dabney, the Civil War is it. Satire that bites. Humor that, line by line, delights. The novel went through four printings in six months. <p>Of course, publishers might balk at the prospect of inserting the four foldout sheets of music from Beethoven's ""Eroica"" Symphony that mark off the four movements of the novel. But they will imagine the enormous delight readers will take in the satire promised in Dabney's cautionary preface: ""The way"" that John Bouche Whacker, 300-pound physician and bachelor and Dabney's invention, of course, ""sails into...everything and everybody quite takes my breath away. Lawyers, military men, professors and students, parsons, agnostics, statesmen, billiard-players, novelists, poetesses, saints and sinners."" Later, Whacker himself warns that, ""I never attack the main body. But let a feeble, emaciated, and worn-out little lie, or a blustering, braggart fraud, or a conceited, coxcombical sham, stray to the right or left, or get belated on the march. I pounce upon him like an owl upon a field-mouse."" <p>Justification enough for reprinting the novel -- something that I urge publishers to consider -- is Dr. Whacker's 44-page introduction, which masquerades as Chapter I to deceive women readers, impatient, like the heroine, to follow the story of the mysterious, romantic stranger who appears in Richmond under the name John Smith (until a child mispronounces it as Don Miff). Ranging far back and far forward in time, Whacker spares nobody, neither illustrious ancestors nor hypothetical descendants. Writing the mock biography of Don Miff for and directly to his descendant five centuries hence, whom he imagines will be Chinese, Whacker makes witty observations on a vast array of Western Civilization's follies, injecting suddenly a very dramatic episode of the Civil War. <p>From his depiction of the upper class domestic and social life of 1860 Richmond that Virginians waged war to protect, Dabney makes a leap into 1864. Of the 492 pages and 80 chapters only about 71 pages and a few chapters are devoted to the War itself, but those pages benefit from comparison with John William De Forest, Ambrose Bierce, and other masters of Civil War narrative. Like his West Tennessee counterpart, Sam Watkins, whose witty, sometimes satirical, sometimes lyrical, often brutally frank memoir, <i>Company Aytch</i> [reviewed here in Fall 1999 <i>CWBR</i>], appeared four years earlier, Dabney fought in the War. <p>Whacker advises his reader to skip Chapter XXVIII in which he embarks upon a disquisition on slavery. He often pauses to remark upon the problems of writing the narrative itself. On page 341, he satirizes the novelist's creation of his characters, inviting the heroine to write her own audience-pleasing chapter. <p>Among Dabney's other Shandian devices are: letters; very brief chapters; footnotes; poems; digressions; sudden bursts of florid rhetoric; literary, historical, and religious allusions; and omitted passages, indicated by ellipses. The rendering of narrative is leisurely, but Dabney's witty style, full of subtle intimations, conveys a sustained sense of a singularly appealing sensibility, imagination, and intellect. Unfortunately, we may enjoy that style in only one other book, <i>Gold That Did Not Glitter</i> (1889). Dabney died at age 59."

2301			REDISCOVERING CIVIL WAR CLASSICS:<p>Hayward Cirker, innovator		Madden, David			"<br>Twenty-five years ago, buoyed by the Bicentennial Spirit, I ventured in my Dodge Dart upon a nationwide odyssey of America, giving prearranged and impromptu readings from my fiction. Springfield, Illinois, was my first stop. Listening to the African-American guide in Lincoln's house, I noticed a book of Civil War photographs by Alexander Gardner on the foyer table for sale. I bought it. It was one of the inspirations for my later Civil War novel, <i>Sharpshooter</i>, out of the research for which I created the United States Civil War Center. All that is a build-up to my eager public declaration on this occasion that I owe that Springfield moment to the late, venerable Hayward Cirker, venturesome founder of Dover Publications.<p>Readers of <i>Civil War Book Review</i> all know Dover books, the look, feel, and smell of them, and are grateful for their existence. One of the many reasons why it is appropriate in this column to pay homage to Hayward Cirker is that, with very few exceptions, every Dover book is a rediscovery. Hayward was monolithic for me and I miss him terribly, even as only a voice on the phone, in letters, and in his presence wherever I see his books on shelves. I am proud to say that I helped create several and suggested others.<p>Following the Gardner book and the books of two other photographers Hayward rediscovered, Andrew Russell and George Barnard, the first history of the War I read was Fletcher Pratt's. Sixteen years later, at my urging, Hayward reissued Pratt's <i>Short History</i>. Inside my ""Dover"" folder is a list of almost 40 projects Hayward and I discussed. Every time we talked, like two matches striking each other, we discussed three or four books that needed reprinting or creating, at least one of which actually got published. Our spirited conversations produced <i>Spies of the Confederacy</i>, Edwin Forbes's <i>Civil War Etchings</i>, Whitman's <i>Civil War Poetry and Prose</i>, Bierce's <i>Civil War Stories</i>, a Civil War uniforms coloring book, Porter's <i>Naval History of the Civil War</i>, Silber's <i>Songs of the Civil War</i>, and a postcard book of Brady's photographs of Civil War leaders.<p>Hayward was my ideal as one of the last of the great imaginative, innovative, risk-taking publishers. I told him so, often, on the phone, because we never met. What inspired me to write to Hayward was his major publishing innovation of bringing out classics for a buck, exploding into a china shop of overpriced books. Only a man that crazy could get that rich that fast. Rich mostly in the pure enjoyment of doing the deed itself. The kinship I felt with him at that time derived from my own successful effort to innovate in the college textbook market, glutted with overpriced eponymous anthologies, by lowering drastically the price of textbooks I created for Harcourt Brace. We delighted in each other's innovations.<p>Soon after World War II, with his wife Blanche's intimate collaboration, Hayward created a humble, homemade, homespun, mom-and-pop outfit, named Dover after their home, that mastered a tough business. He discovered books in the public domain and made them affordable. Private profit and public service are a winning combination.<p>Hayward's intellect was eclectic, his standard was excellence, but amiability and generosity also were traits that made him distinctive among publishers. Dover now offers 7,000 titles--many of which have stayed in print for decades--oddly chosen classics, books as practical as a Swiss knife, music scores, art, architecture, and, above all, some say, timeless illustrated children's books. He explored every conceivable discipline and area of knowledge, with ventures into the odd, even the exotic, and the esoteric. To throw away one of his colorfully illustrated catalogues is to feel at least a twinge of guilt. ""This is a permanent book,"" Dover trumpets, and dealers put Hayward's quality paperbacks next to hardcover books.<p>""I'm no Renaissance man,"" he demurred once in a <i>Time</i> magazine profile. ""I'm just curious."" Sounds like the spirit of da Vinci to me. He died without exhausting his vast and deep curiosity. Was Hayward Cirker the last of the myriad minded, venturesome, risk-taking publishers? If the attention he deserves is paid to him, we may find that the man, like his books, will enjoy permanent influence.<p><i>Founding director of the United States Civil War Center and currently Donald and Velvia Crumbley Professor of Creative Writing at LSU, David Madden is editor of two newly published books,</i> Beyond the Battlefield (2000)<i> and </i>The Legacy of Robert Penn Warren (2000). <i>He is at work on his ninth novel.</i>"		Summer 2000	2000-06-01	Classics								"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=214 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/HaywardCirkerInnovator.jpg"">"						
5436			CIVIL WAR SESQUICENTENNIAL: <br>Strategy, Tactics, and Fighting the Civil War		Hess, Earl			"<p>
     Now that we are deep in the sesquicentennial of the Civil War, it is a good time to take some high ground and survey the historiography, remind ourselves what has been done in the past, and tweak our imagination about what ought to be done in the future. Perhaps there are no more fundamental subjects regarding military history than strategy and tactics, although they also tend to be subjects that historians overlooked.</p>
<p>
     It may come as a surprise to say that Civil War scholars have paid little attention to strategy, for in one way or another it is intertwined in every battle and campaign book ever written about the conflict. Moreover, there are at least a handful of books that take an overview of military operations and as a matter of course discuss some aspects of the subject. But in the realm of modern, concentrated studies specifically focused on strategy, there are very few.</p> 
<p>
     Donald Stoker, a professor at the Naval Post-Graduate School in Monterey, California, authored such a concentrated study of Civil War strategy in <i>The Grand Design: Strategy and the U.S. Civil War</i> (Oxford University Press, 2010). In many ways it is the best modern introduction to the subject, a starting point for anyone interested in defining strategy conceptually and seeing those concepts applied to the specific circumstances of the Civil War. Strategy is a hydra-headed monster in today’s world, involving multiple layers that include public policy, grand strategy, operations, and tactics.</p>
<p> 
     I believe Civil War scholars have barely scratched the surface of this subject, despite the numerous books that mention or delve into strategic studies in some way. Stoker’s book is a good example of what I mean. He accepts and perpetuates most of the old canards that historians have had a tendency to present as fact about Civil War strategy. He believes that Leonidas Polk’s occupation of Columbus, Kentucky, was a strategic mistake because it threw that neutral state into the Union camp. He believes that Henry W. Halleck could have conquered Mississippi and taken Vicksburg after the nearly bloodless fall of Corinth in the early summer of 1862. He discounts the significance of the Union re-opening of the Mississippi River. Most importantly, Stoker ignores the significance of logistics and supply when contemplating strategy. Armies could not go anywhere if they lacked the logistical capacity to move troops, food, and ammunition to those areas, and any student of strategy needs to give a great deal of attention to these aspects of the subject.</p>
<p> 
     Like so many other Civil War historians before him, Stoker tends to view strategy as moving pawns across a flat board instead of understanding it as Civil War commanders were compelled to understand it, as the physical, emotional, and mental reality of life in the 1860s. Moreover, there is too much tendency to simply accept what successful generals such as Grant and Sherman had to say in their memoirs about strategy instead of reading the dispatches in the <i>Official Records</i> with care and thoroughness. And there is too much tendency to accept what well-respected historians of the recent past have stated in their popular studies.</p>
<p>
     I urge Civil War military historians to forget for a time what anyone else has said or written and instead go back to the essential primary sources (the <i>Official Records</i> chief among them), keep an open mind, and place themselves in the realm of 1863 instead of 2013. This may seem trite advice, but I am convinced a good many well-meaning historians do not do it as well as they should. All of the old canards mentioned above as accepted by Stoker and a host of other historians are in desperate need of a challenge, for there is plenty of evidence in the primary material to replace them with alternate interpretations.</p>
<p>
     The realm of tactics also is a fundamentally important aspect of military operations, but relatively few historians have devoted concentrated effort to it. Like those scholars who mention strategy, many historians have dealt with grand tactics while discussing individual battles and campaigns, but no more than perhaps half a dozen books, articles, and dissertations specifically look at tactics as a subject of study. Moreover, all of them look at grand tactics (the higher level of the subject, dealing with whether it was wise for a commander to attack or to defend) rather than at the lower level of the subject (which deals with the complicated formations and maneuvers of the linear system). More importantly, all of the tactical historians have taken it for granted that the rifle musket used by both armies in the Civil War was a devastating new weapon of destruction that killed soldiers at a range of 500 yards rather than the older smoothbore musket's effective range of 100 yards. Civil War officers and soldiers alike failed to understand that change and continued to fight in ways compatible with the smoothbore, and the results were indecisive battles and a prolonged war of unrivalled blood-letting. Nearly every historian who has written on the subject has looked for evidence to support this old assumption, ignoring a body of evidence in the primary sources that strongly contradicts the argument. The major works representing this old assumption remain Grady McWhiney and Perry D. Jamieson, <i>Attack and Die: Civil War Military Tactics and the Southern Heritage</i> (University of Alabama Press, 1982), and Edward Hagerman, <i>The American Civil War and the Origins of Modern Warfare: Ideas, Organization, and Field Command</i> (Indiana University Press, 1988).</p>
<p>
     The English historian Paddy Griffith initially questioned this thesis in his book <i>Battle Tactics of the Civil War</i> (Yale University Press, 1989). But Griffith looked mostly at the actual range of combat as evidenced in the official reports to argue that combat in the Civil War took place at short ranges consistent with the smoothbore musket instead of at the long range of the new rifle musket. This point decisively challenged the basis of the old interpretation. Griffith’s argument was bitterly disputed and criticized by most Civil War historians at the time, but by soon after the turn of the new century Mark Grimsley and Brent Nosworthy accepted Griffith’s argument and supported it with their own research into the official reports.</p>
<p>
     My own book, <i>The Rifle Musket in the Civil War: Reality and Myth</i>, (University Press of Kansas, 2008), built on the initial contributions of Griffith, Grimsley, and Nosworthy and extended it to subtopics other than the actual range of firing in the Civil War. The result was a thorough refutation of the old interpretation and the proposal of a new one to replace it. For many reasons, Civil War armies failed to take advantage of the longer range of the rifle musket. Technical difficulties played a role; the bullet fired by the rifle musket had an arced, or parabolic, trajectory. That meant the bullet sailed above the heads of approaching infantrymen for much of its flight across the battlefield. Neither army taught its recruits how to use the rifle to compensate for this fact. More importantly, officers and enlisted men alike were convinced (with good reason) that close range firing was more effective than long range firing and deliberately waited until an attacking enemy was less than 100 yards away before opening fire. Even more compelling, a comparison of casualty rates in smoothbore battles of the 18th century reveals that the older weapon produced losses that were just as high, in many cases higher, than those of Civil War battles.</p>
<p>
     The new interpretation of the rifle musket—that it had relatively little impact on Civil War operations other than to improve skirmishing and sniping—opens up many doors to new interpretations of tactics as well. Previously, historians had assumed that the linear tactical formations employed by both armies in the Civil War were outmoded and contributed to horrific casualty rates because they were not matched to the capabilities of the new rifle musket. But if that new weapon was used in a way that its effect was the same as the smoothbore, then the linear tactical formations were not only useful but the correct type of tactical system to be employed. In fact, one can make an argument based on reading the official reports that most Civil War officers learned those complicated formations and maneuvers well and used them very effectively under great duress on the battlefield to save their units from unexpected threats or to exploit initial advantages by employing adept moves at the right moment.</p>
<p>
     There is a danger that the study of traditional military history, what many scholars derisively call “drum and bugles,"" will atrophy in an age when social and cultural history is riding high. We can avoid that only if we reorient our thinking away from merely writing good stories for popular consumption and toward a thorough re-evaluation of our craft. The only way to do so is by re-visiting the primary material, thinking in new ways about our subject, and re-invigorating it with new (and supportable) interpretations as well as by opening up new subjects of study.</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
The year was 1862.  The Reverend J. Mitchell, the newly appointed Commissioner of Emigration escorted five African Americans into the White House at the president’s request.  Abraham Lincoln wanted to hear their views on colonization.</p>  
<p>
On that August afternoon, Lincoln told the men seated before him that Congress had recently appropriated a sum of money to colonize freed slaves.  Lincoln knew that African Americans might resist colonization but one wonders whether he realized the vehement opposition to the idea. “Why should they leave this country?” the president asked rhetorically.  He continued to provide them with an answer:</p>
<p><blockquote>
You and we are different races.  We have between us a broader difference than exists between almost any other two races.  Whether it is right or wrong I need not discuss, but this physical difference is a great disadvantage to us both, as I think your race suffer very greatly, many of them by living among us, while ours suffer from your presence.  In a word we suffer on each side.  If this is admitted, it affords a reason at least why we should be separated.  You here are free men I suppose.  (5 <i>Collected Works</i> 371).</blockquote></p>
<p>
A voice among them replied “Yes, sir” to the President’s rhetorical question.  Lincoln told them “Your race are suffering, in my judgment, the greatest wrong inflicted on any people.” (Ibid. 371-72).  Nevertheless, he asked them to consider whether removing their classification as slaves would really place them on equal grounds with the white race.  In Lincoln’s estimation, it would not.</p>
<p>
Lincoln urged the men to consider supporting colonization.</p>
<p><blockquote>
We look to our condition, owing to the existence of the two races on this continent.  I need not recount to you the effects upon white men, growing out of the institution of Slavery.  I believe in its general evil effects on the white race.  See our present condition---the country engaged in war!---our white men cutting one another’s throats, none knowing how far it will extend; and then consider what we know to be the truth.  But for your race among us there could not be war, although many men engaged on either side do not care for you one way or the other.  Nevertheless, I repeat, without the institution of Slavery and the colored race as a basis, the war could not have an existence.
It is better for us both, therefore, to be separated.  I know that there are free men among you, who even if they could better their condition are not as much inclined to go out of the country as those, who being slaves could obtain their freedom on this condition.  I suppose one of the principal difficulties in the way of colonization is that the free colored man cannot see that his comfort would be advanced by it.  You may believe you can live in Washington or elsewhere in the United States the remainder of your life [as easily], perhaps more so than you can in any foreign country, and hence you may come to the conclusion that you have nothing to do with the idea of going to a foreign country.  This is (I speak in no unkind sense) an extremely selfish view of the case.  (5 <i>Collected Works</i> 372).</blockquote></p>

Lincoln pointed, by example, to the successes in the colony of Liberia, with a population of 300,000 – 400,000, including some 12,000 American slaves who had settled there upon being freed.  Recognizing that African Americans might not want to settle as far away as Africa, Lincoln offered an alternative:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>The place I am thinking about having for a colony is in Central America.  It is nearer to us than Liberia---not much more than one-fourth as far as Liberia, and within seven days’ run by steamers.  Unlike Liberia it is on a great line of travel---it is a highway.  The country is a very excellent one for any people, and with great natural resources and advantages, and especially because of the similarity of climate with your native land---thus being suited to your physical condition.
The particular place I have in view is to be a great highway from the Atlantic or Caribbean Sea to the Pacific Ocean, and this particular place has all the advantages for a colony.  On both sides there are harbors among the finest in the world.  Again, there is evidence of very rich coal mines.  A certain amount of coal is valuable in any country, and there may be more than enough for the wants of the country.  Why I attach so much importance to coal is, it will afford an opportunity to the inhabitants for immediate employment till they get ready to settle permanently in their homes.  (5 <i>Collected Works</i> 373-74).</blockquote></p>
<p>
Lincoln asked the men to consider the idea and to help him get “a number of able-bodied men, with their wives and children, who are willing to go” and join the government’s colonization efforts.  Lincoln expressed that his plan would work so long as he could find “twenty-five able-bodied men, with a mixture of women and children…” who were willing to go.  (5 <i>Collected Works</i> 375).</p>
<p>
The president’s remarks, which were recorded by a reporter present, were printed in the <i>New York Tribune</i> the next day and, not surprisingly, were criticized by the newspaper as it was widely believed that colonization was cost-prohibitive.</p>
<p>
To many scholars, Lincoln’s interest in African colonization of former slaves seemed unrealistic and also inconsistent with the sixteenth president’s strong belief that slavery was morally wrong.  But Brazil, a country along with Cuba practicing slavery, also had an interest in sending former slaves to Africa. Perhaps, then, Lincoln’s idea may seem less surprising.  So I wonder if there is any evidence that Lincoln looked to Brazil’s policies of colonization/repatriation for his interest in sending the freed men to Africa, prior to the Emancipation Proclamation.  Neither the Collected Works nor the Robert Todd Lincoln Collection at the Library of Congress contain anything that suggests that Lincoln looked to Brazil.  Nevertheless, the two countries followed a similar course.</p>
<p>
In America, however, only weeks after Lincoln had interviewed the five African Americans at the White House, he took a step that perhaps purposefully foiled his colonization plans.  On September 22, 1862, he raised the hopes of the African American as they had never been raised before: he issued a preliminary emancipation proclamation, warning the rebellious states that if they did not lay down their arms by January 1, 1863, he would declare their slaves free.</p>
<p>
The failure of colonization in America may have been one of Lincoln’s own purposeful self-doing.  It is possible that Lincoln’s public actions were a way to prepare the white population for his emancipation policy, which would abolish slavery altogether.  That is, by advocating colonization in his annual messages and publicly, it would make his Emancipation Proclamation more acceptable to those who resisted it in the North.</p>
<p>
Historian Don E. Fehrenbacher has suggested “that Lincoln's support of colonization . . . Became during his presidential years a calculated, dissimulative strategy aimed primarily at the white mind rather than the black population — in other words, that he hoped for nothing more than a token emigration of blacks to relieve some of the racial fears engendered by the thought of emancipation.”  (Fehrenbacher,Civil War Book Review 221)</p>
<p>
By the time the Emancipation Proclamation had been issued, colonization was no longer supported.  An editorial in the New York <i>Tribune</i> read:</p> 
<p>
<blockquote>No one who has not thoughtfully and carefully and earnestly considered President Lincoln's proclamation will be likely to realize how admirable and comprehensive are its suggestions, and how surely their adoption will conduce to national integrity and internal peace. Look for a moment at the question of negro expatriation, which is one of the chief difficulties of our position. There are many worthy and good men, and ten times more of the other sort, who hold, that whenever slavery is abolished the negro should be sent out of the country. We have much charity for this opinion, for we once held it, but we are now convinced that it is an error. That the negro race, wherever free, will gradually migrate southward, colonizing the less populous West Indies, Central America, and the adjacent portions of South America, we believe. Climate, soil, natural products, ease of obtaining a rude yet ample subsistence, and the ready fraternisation of blacks with the Indian and mongrel races who now exist in those regions, and who are nowise above our Southern negroes in the social scale, not even in their own opinion, will all attract them that way. But if slavery were ended tomorrow, we are confident that even South Carolina would be in no hurry to expel from her soil the most industrious and productive half of her people; that portion amongst whom drunkards and profligates are scarce, while its office-seekers, bar-room loungers, and pot-house brawlers have yet to be developed. A State can spare its idlers far better than its workers, and it is only from dread of their influence on the slaves that a slave-holding people ever desire the expulsion of their free blacks. Were slavery dead this day, even the Carolina aristocracy would prefer, as labourers on the plantations, the negroes to whom they are accustomed, and whose manners are respectful and submissive, to any immigrants by whom they could be promptly replaced. It is quite likely that in time white labour would demonstrate its superior energy and intelligence by driving out the black. But for the present the Carolina planters would generally hire their ex-slaves more satisfactorily to themselves than they could replace them from any quarter. (Mitgang/Dicey, 80-81.)</blockquote></p>  
<p>
Ultimately, the end of slavery in America had a global impact, leading to a change in beliefs in other countries and the destruction of the institution in Brazil and Cuba, the only other places in the Western Hemisphere where it still existed.</p>  
<p>
As one abolitionist in Brazil remarked after the Brazilian government’s first steps toward abolition of slavery in 1871, he was glad “to see Brazil receive so quickly the moral of the Civil War in the United States.” (Degler, 42).</p>
<p>
In an interchange discussion which took place online over the course of several months in 2009 for the <i>Journal of American History</i>, Professor Nicola Miller opined:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>In Cuba . . . The impact of Lincoln was probably greatest and had the greatest social depth.  There, as in Brazil, the questions of abolition and emancipation were salient, and images of Lincoln figured in debates about slavery and abolition in a variety of (not always positive) ways.</blockquote></p>  
<p>
In their book <i>Colonization After Emancipation</i>, authors Phillip W. Magness and Sebastian N. Page likewise recognize the global affect of Lincoln’s policies, pointing to the British archives which includes an order authorizing a British agent to begin recruiting freed slaves to be sent to the Caribbean in June 1863.  As Magness and Page note, that scheme failed in early 1864, likely due to American polices, as British officials worried about the legality of the Emancipation Proclamation and the risk that the South could still win the war.  (Magness, 123). The authors deserve great credit for their research in a neglected British archive. Their book strongly suggests President Lincoln continued to support colonization after he issued the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863 through secret diplomacy with the British for the creation of a colony in British Honduras – now Belize. But there is a distinction between official U. S. government policy of supporting colonization with funding and contracts with private individuals and Lincoln’s personal view of voluntary colonization by free blacks. It is important to remember that the President’s annual message to Congress in 1862 – less than a month before the final Emancipation Proclamation continued to promote colonization as well as compensated emancipation as alternatives for dealing with African Americans. While the authors mention White House secretary John Hay’s diary entry of July 1, 1864 that Lincoln had, “sloughed off the idea of colonization,” they give it little credibility as Hay was not in the loop over the President’s continued efforts to promote colonization (Hay, 203). Yet, we need to take Hay at his word that Lincoln had genuinely given up colonization as his government’s policy without surrendering the idea as an option or alternative for free blacks. If this is so, then the documents uncovered by the authors make sense and the evidence is consistent with the view that Lincoln consistently supported colonization but only if free blacks gave their consent. It became obvious that most blacks opposed removing themselves from America, providing another reason Lincoln that retreated from colonization. Magness and Page also cite Benjamin F. Butler who, in his <i>Autobiography and Personal Reminiscences . . : Butler’s Book</i> (Boston: A. M. Thayer, 1892), represents that Lincoln discussed his wish to export “the negroes” especially those “whom we have armed and disciplined” to avoid “a race war.”(Butler, 903). But as Mark E. Neely, Jr. has proven, the story is doubtful as Butler was not present in Washington when he claimed that the interview with the President took place.</p>
<p>
This book attracted much attention when published over if, when, and how Lincoln treated this racist policy. But one thing is certain. Once the President allowed African-American enlistment in the army on January 1, 1863, he insured a biracial country because no one can ask a man to fight for his country and then tell him it is not his country.</p>
<p>
Ultimately, the flawed and disfavored concept of colonization never took hold in the United States, and by the time Lincoln had signed the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863, the word “colonization” was forgotten.</p>
<p>
Charles R. McKirdy’s <i>Lincoln Apostate: The Matson Slave Case</i> demonstrates the complex ad mixture of Abraham Lincoln’s anti-slavery beliefs, his commitment to the law while representing a slave owner and the fact that he was no abolitionist.  Why would this anti-slavery lawyer represent a slave owner seeking the return of his “property” – a runaway slave woman and her four children?  The author places Abraham Lincoln’s representation of Robert Matson, a Kentucky slave owner, in the context of 1847 – thirteen years before Lincoln became President.</p>
<p>
Eric Foner and others successfully argue that Lincoln changed and evolved.  During his time as a successful attorney and politician, President-elect Lincoln was no threat to slavery since he believed it was a local decision and for most of his life believed in colonization and, then as President, compensated emancipation.  This book does accurately point out Lincoln’s great faith in colonization which he, in part, learned from his mentor Henry Clay, his “beau ideal” of a statesman, despite disagreement from members of his cabinet and only ceasing to advocate it publicly after issuing the Emancipation Proclamation.</p>
<p>
It is not uncommon for lawyers, then and now, to take cases when their personal feelings differ from their clients.  That is what lawyers do.  Even one of Lincoln’s opposing counsel noted Lincoln’s aggressive advocacy:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>. . . His trenchant blows and cold logic and subtle knitting together and presentation of facts favorable to his side of the case, soon dissipated all hope that any advantage was likely to be gained by Lincoln’s liberal concession, but rather that he had gained from the court a more patient and favorable hearing and consideration of the facts on which he relied for success.</blockquote></p>
<p>
But the issue remains, why did Lincoln represent Matson in the case?</p>
<p>
The author explores one theory wherein Lincoln, as a Whig, espoused keeping one’s passion and feelings under control and the law, with its judicial system, maintained the order necessary to avoid mob rule.  As to slavery, Whigs accepted, if not embraced, it as protected by the Constitution and to deny it would lead to a breakup of the Union.</p>
<p>
Another theory is that at that point in his career, slavery had not reached the level of understanding by Lincoln of the power of this “peculiar institution” (Stampp, 3).   Lincoln was not yet sensitive enough to those held in bondage.  To McKirdy, this argument fails to properly evaluate “the insights of a very insightful man,” as in 1864 Lincoln wrote, “I am naturally anti-slavery.  As slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong.  I cannot remember when I did not so think, and feel.”  (McKirdy, 92), 7 <i>Collected Works</i>, 281). What the author fails to realize is that these comments came seventeen years after the Matson case.</p>
<p>
The author looks at Lincoln’s ego as the reason he took the case.  This high profile case would raise Lincoln’s stature – if not for abolitionists, at least for potential clients, the bench and bar.  The author does recognize Lincoln’s, “continued torment” (McKirdy,95; 1 Collected Works 1953:260)  and conflict as something that would never be attempted again on this issue.</p>
<p>
But that does not mean that Abraham Lincoln did not have misgivings about representing Matson, especially when, after being retained by him, he had a chance to represent the slave family but he had already committed himself to the slave owner.  Lincoln lost the case when the judges, hearing it, ruled that since slavery was illegal in Illinois, the slaves were free when they entered the state.</p>
<p>
Jane Bryant and her four children belonged to Robert Matson who brought slaves to farm his land in Coles County, Illinois, every year, returning them to Kentucky after harvest.  Despite the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 and the Illinois state constitution which made slaves free by residence on free soil, Lincoln argued that it was a long established custom that Jane Bryant was a seasonal worker and thus could not be considered a “resident” of Illinois.  The judges disagreed.</p>
<p>
What has been considered a paradox involving the “Great Emancipator” on the side of a slaveholder has continued to fascinate many over the years.  But as McKirdy points out, this ignores the jurisprudence as a slave’s “domicile” or residence and “sojourn” in a free state was a generally accepted distinction in American law. At the time, as this book points out, Abraham Lincoln and his co-counsel, Usher F. Linder, had the law on their side but not the judges – even though in 1843 the Illinois Supreme Court had ruled that  “sojourn” in Illinois by the owner and his slaves did not make the slaves free.  The judges, Samuel H. Treat and William Wilson, followed a new tradition in the North by ruling that slaves became free once they touched free soil, thus outraging the South.</p>

5803			A LOOK AT LINCOLN: <br>Consensus is Hard to Find		Williams, Frank			"<p>
Approximately 65,000 books have been published on the Civil War plus another 16,000 on Abraham Lincoln—more than one a day since the war ended.  But between the study and storytelling, there is a tremendous lack of consensus about what the Civil War means.</p>
<p>
150 years later, it is difficult to fully understand and appreciate the lessons of the Civil War.  The Civil War does not easily fit our Pollyannaish perception that with war, comes peace, progress and freedom.  Instead, the Civil War marks a pivotal moment in our nation’s history that tells a story not only of survival in that moment but also the vision of a nation fulfilling the promises in the Declaration of Independence. Today, Abraham Lincoln’s legacy reminds us of this vision.</p>

<p>
The stream of blood that was initiated with the firing on Fort Sumter passed through Gettysburg, Reconstruction and into the civil rights era, right down to the present.  150 years later, it is more relevant than ever.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present.  The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise to the occasion.  As our case is new, so we must think anew, and act anew.  We must disenthrall ourselves and then we shall save our country.</blockquote></p>
<p>
In four simple sentences, President Lincoln delivered an important message in his Second Annual Message to Congress in December 1862 that would continue to have meaning for our nation.  It is difficult to imagine more prescient words delivered by any president in our lifetime.  </p>
<p>
As we celebrate and remember the 150th anniversary of the Civil War, it is important to reflect upon the uncertainty that afflicted our nation and the hope to which the President, the country and troops – both Union and Confederate – clung to so dearly.   For a powerful account of the battle that changed the face of the war and its military and political repercussions, read Allen C. Guelzo’s prize-winning <i>Gettyburg: The Last Invasion</i> (Vintage Civil War Library).</p>
<p>
No president has such a hold on our minds as Abraham Lincoln.  He lived at the dawn of photography, and his pinecone face made a haunting picture.  He was the best writer in all American politics, and his words are even more powerful than his images.  The Civil War was the nation’s greatest trial, and the race issue that caused it remains with us today.  Lincoln’s death by murder gave his life a poignant and violent climax, and allows the always fascinating game of “what if?""</p>
<p>
It is not by chance that one of Lincoln’s best speeches was delivered on a battlefield on the occasion of dedicating a cemetery for those who fought, died, and were buried there.  Lincoln said that the brave men, living and dead, who struggled on this ground, this battlefield, had “consecrated"" it better than he or anyone else could.  Their cause was great and noble.  We also remember Lincoln saying that their work was “unfinished,"" and that we, the living, should “highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation under God, shall have a new birth of freedom,"" and that government of, by and for the people “shall not perish from the earth.""</p>
<p>
We remember it because he took great pains to say things beautifully.</p>

<p>
Joseph R. Fornieri’ s <i>Abraham Lincoln: Philosopher Statesman</i> (Southern Illinois University Press) takes us down the path describing Lincoln’s political greatness as a statesman.  As a great leader, he saved the Union, presided over the end of slavery, and helped to pave the way for an interracial democracy.  Fornieri contends that Lincoln’s political genius is best understood in terms of a philosophical statesmanship that united greatness of thought and action.  In other words, Lincoln was pragmatic.</p>
<p>
Harold Holzer’s companion book for young people to the, now classic, Steven Spielberg film, is <i>Lincoln: How Abraham Lincoln Ended Slavery in America</i> (HarperCollins).  It begins on January 31, 1865 as the president anxiously awaits word on whether Congress will finally vote to pass the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution ending slavery forever.  Using letters, speeches, memoirs and documents by Abraham Lincoln and others, Holzer covers Lincoln’s boyhood, his move from Kentucky to Indiana and Illinois, his work as a lawyer and congressman, his unsuccessful candidacies for the U.S. Senate and his victory in two presidential elections, as well as his multi-tasking as President and Commander-in-Chief during the Civil War.  Holzer also joins others like Louis P. Masur in <i>Lincoln’s Hundred Days: The Emancipation Proclamation and the War for the Union </i>(Belknap-Harvard University Press) and James Oakes in <i>Freedom National: The Destruction of Slavery in the United States 1861-1865</i> (Norton), with another book on the Emancipation Proclamation.  <i>Emancipating Lincoln: The Proclamation in Text, Context, and Memory</i> (Harvard University Press) is the primer on how Lincoln changed the war’s aim from reunion to reunion and freedom as it is difficult to add a war aim in the middle of a conflict.</p>
<p>
Holzer’s <i>Lincoln and the Power of the Press: The War for Public Opinion</i> (Simon & Schuster) demonstrates how Lincoln as lawyer, politician, and then as president, was able to co-opt the press by following his own advice articulated in one of his 1858 debates with Senator Stephen A. Douglas, “public sentiment is everything.""</p>
<p>
At the end of the Civil War, Americans faced a formidable challenge: how to memorialize 750,000 dead soldiers, Northern and Southern.  As Walt Whitman mused, it was “the dead, the dead, the dead—our dead—our South our North, ours all"" that preoccupied the country.  After all, if the same number of Americans per capita had died in Vietnam as died in the Civil War, 7.5 million names would be on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, instead of 58,000.  Drew Gilpin Faust’s <i>This Republic of Suffering: Death and the American Civil War </i>(Knopf) helps explain the conundrum.  Freedom, too, is no guarantee of well-being. See also Jim Downs’s great study of how African-Americans despaired in <i>Sick From Freedom: African-American Illness and Suffering During the Civil War and Reconstruction</i> (Oxford).</p>
<p>
This serves as an extremely timely reminder that the American experiment, contrary to the Founders’ assertion, has not been a “self-evident truth,"" but in fact a highly debatable proposition that needed to be proved, not just in July 1863 at Gettysburg, but on many days and in many places since.</p>

Lincoln would state, “that in time of war blood grows hot, and blood is spilled….Confidence dies, and universal suspicion reigns.  Each man feels an impulse to kill his neighbor, lest he be first killed by him.  Revenge and retaliation follow….But this is not all.  Every foul bird comes abroad and every dirty reptile rises up.  These add crime to confusion.""  William A. Blair describes how the President coped in <i>With Malice Toward Some: Treason and Loyalty in the Civil War Era</i> (UNC Press).</p>
<p>
While there have been thousands of books about Lincoln, there are virtually none about his foreign policy.  Part of the concern is that Lincoln had a powerful and, arguably, competent Secretary of State in William Henry Seward.  But Kevin Peraino solves this dilemma in <i>Lincoln in the World: The Making of a Statesman and the Dawn of American Power</i> (Crown).  The author chose only those events in which Lincoln was deeply involved with focus on five distinct conflicts defined by the author as “a Lincolnian foreign policy"" – his objection to the Mexican War, his disagreement with Secretary of State William H. Seward over the control of foreign policy, the <i>Trent</i> crisis of 1861, the “molding"" of public opinion, and the French occupation of Mexico.</p>

John McKee Barr, with a full warts-and-all biography of a dedicated minority, tells us how they viewed Abraham Lincoln as not only the worst president but a dictator and criminal who violated the Constitution while he created the overbearing federal power we know today—and the idea of racial equality to boot.  In <i>Loathing Lincoln: An American Tradition From the Civil War to the Present </i>(Louisiana State University Press), Barr surveys the broad criticism about Lincoln that emerged onto the national stage.  But Lincoln is redeemed in the late James A. Rawley’s encyclopedic <i>A. Lincoln Dialogue</i> (University of Nebraska Press).  Edited by William C.

<p>
A century and a half after his death, we are a nation because of Lincoln’s undeterred will and unrelenting hope.  Leading our nation through civil war is perhaps his greatest living victory, but, posthumously, his greatest victory and endearing legacy is the hope he instilled in our nation and in each of us.</p>

4756			CIVIL WAR TREASURES <br>A Confederate Girl Remembers</br>		Jewett, Leah Wood			"<p>
Best known for her war-time diary, published in part by her son as <i>A Confederate Girl’s Diary</i> (1913), Sarah Morgan Dawson (1842-1909) was the daughter of a prominent judge in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. She, along with her widowed mother and sister, fled the capital city to Linwood Plantation near Port Hudson in 1862 when Union gunboats began appearing with regularity on the Mississippi River. After witnessing the siege at Port Hudson, Morgan and family moved to New Orleans until the end of the war.</p>
<p>  
Following the war Morgan married Francis Dawson, the British editor of the Charleston, South Carolina newspaper <i>News and Courier</i>. She was a contributing writer to the paper, signing her columns with the pseudonyms “Mr. Fowler"" (Fowler being her mother’s maiden name) or “Feu Follet."" After her husband was murdered in 1889, Morgan moved to Paris, where she lived out her years as a widow with her son, Warrington.</p>
<p> 
<i>Hope Estate Ladies</i> is an unpublished manuscript, housed within the LSU Libraries Special Collections. Dawson describes people and places from a lost way of life, and not always a pleasant one. The following is excerpted from the reminiscence.</p>

<p>
<blockquote>Nov. 19th 1908</p>
<p>
“The Hope Estate Ladies""</p>
<p>
This record is to oblige Ethel, who dislikes vulgar stories, and thinks anything concerning the Hope Estate Ladies, would be much more attractive than tales of low, common people. To me, their life, because of its futility and emptiness is sadder than the worst recorded here. They lived, and died, these Hope Estates Ladies, without leaving a bubble on the surface of the waters to mark where they sank at rest forever. And without a most respectable, quaint, and interesting though prosaic group, these Hope Estates Ladies of the old regime!</p>
<p>
Hope Estate was the Sugar Plantation of Colonel Philip Hickey*, on the left bank of the Mississippi, five miles below Baton Rouge. “Grandpa"" we called him. Not that he bore that relationship, but because his daughter Adèle had married my mother’s brother, Walter Fowler; and his daughter Caro had married my father’s brother, Morris Morgan. “Aunt Eliza"" his eldest daughter came naturally to us. “Aunt Patsy"" had died many, many years before I was born, sacrificed her life and her eye sight to the careful stitching of exactly two threads in the multitudinous seams, tucks, and frills of sheerest Batiste that clothed her three Walsh children two of whom were married before I remember them. Aunt Patsy kept her several servants at fine needlework, also. But I believe they all lived ages after the foolish mother was dust and ashes, and the little marvels of fine serving were in the ash heap. There was a brother, Philip, who went the way of flesh early, thanks to Yellow fever. And Uncle Dan, who lived across the river at “New Hope"" who lived to see the ruin wrought by the war, and in his dire poverty escaped by a miracle to suffer still more, when a crevasse engulfed his whole plantation, house and all it contained.</p>
<p>
Grandma Hickey made a deep impression on my childish mind, the only time I saw her which must have been shortly before her death. She was in deep black, All Hope Estate Ladies wore mourning from birth to death. I think that is why my father hated it so. Whenever they decided to lighten it a little, some remote connection or prematurely deceased baby scion re-plunged them into funereal garb. My father said he had seen them in unbroken black forty years, when Aunt Eliza’s beautiful daughter Mary Scallan, then the young widow of James Mather, burst in upon him in rainbow colors one Sunday accompanied by purple and lilac tinted relatives. And next day, Pretty cousin Mary, whom mother hoped to see Brother’s bride, died of cholera in two hours notice! Hope Estate took up its discarded livery promptly and forever, then….</p>
<p>
After grandma went, probably most of Grandpa’s Sundays were spent at my father’s house or else my father drove down late to see him.… He was very tender to us little ones. Everyone loved him. From the hour he lost his wife, Aunt Eliza, his eldest, never left him. She had buried her beautiful daughter, and now centered her life on her father and her grandson, Jimmy Mather. She and jimmy slept in Grandpa’s room, so that he might never need help in the night. Slender, fragile, gentle, she had survived the bitterness of a terrible marriage, and lived to be a comfort to all who approached her. She had brought up, years before, Aunt Patsy’s three orphan children…</p>
<p>
Hope Estate Ladies wore a deep, black, cape in the house as out of the house. I never remember one of them without this covering. Capes, for me, always evoke Hope Estate. I do not assert that their nightgowns had them, but I really think they must have felt indecently exposed if they had not . Before she was fifteen, Eliza had married a brilliant, dissipated Irishman, a handsome young lawyer whose sallies kept Baton Rouge in an uproar. James Scallan was his name. Grandma foresaw how it would end; but Grandpa would refuse nothing to his adored child. Grandma could only consent on condition of keeping the two under her wing. Hope Estate was used to shelter scores of guests. Rooms seemed to develop according to demand upon hospitality. All that was bright, beautiful, intelligent, or noted, passed sooner or later there.</p>
<p>
I doubt that Grandma showed wisdom in keeping the girl-wife near her. She only condemned the whole family to useless suffering. It was impossible to be blind to the anguish of an immature bride, when the reckless husband spent days and weeks in contented, beaming, witty and affectionate drunkenness. Aunt Eliza dared not murmur, but cried her heart out. “This family makes my little wifey unhappy,"" Mr. Scallan would say. “Sam, my buggy! Mrs. Hickey kindly order a basket of delicacies for my little darling. I shall take her to the Chocktaw Nation, where she shall remain until she is quite restored."" Mother, sisters, cousins and guests would protest save tear their hair, and fall on their knees before the smiling urbane, implacable little man. “You draw fresh tears from my Eliza"" he would laugh. “Kindly let me pass! She needs the Choctaw Nation. You will see her in blooming health when she returns."" And amid shrieks and prayers, Aunt Eliza would be borne wrapped in a blanket if she happened to be critically ill, and placed in the waiting buggy. Not once but scores of times did these disappearances occur. Perhaps Grandpa knew where she went, but certainly no one else ever did. Aunt Eliza was as silent, even to her mother, as respectable married women ever were, in those days. The woman who spoke against her husband was considered lost then. Whether Aunt Eliza learned that tears meant sudden visits to the Choctaw Nation, and that complaint might be followed by scalping, I know not. “Choctaw"" remained a word to conjure with, in that family. And the probably crazy man was shrewd enough to know that an allusion to the tribe would check any sharp remarks mother in law or her daughters might be tempted to indulge in. After some years of this martyrdom, James Scallan decided to take his wife to Baton Rouge away from the women-tongues which so depressed the sensitive soul of his “little wifey."" Every comfort was provided for them, and trained servants sent to guard her from every care. My father lived quite near on the last bluff on the Mississippi River in Baton Rouge, where the State House today stands. There all of us were born, save Jimmy and I, who alone were born in New Orleans. Often in the night, Aunt Eliza’s negroes came to call my father to the scene.</p>
<p>
Notably one night, Aunt Eliza being in a precarious condition from a premature confinement brought on by Mr. Scallan’s drunken recklessness, he entered his home at midnight, in one of his brilliant moods, and declared that the mother and sisters summoned to her aid, were “fretting little wifey!"" It was cruelly cold for that country. It was too late to call for his buggy and start for the Choctaw Nation. So he tenderly gathered up the half dead woman, and bore her into a freezing room where he placed her in an unmade bed. At her groans of anguish, he laughed “Bad bed! To make wifey cry? She wants another? Then she shall have a new one!"" The frenzied family watched her dragged or rather carried over the whole house, before my father appeared to take the dying victim from him and to put James Scallan summarily in bed himself. He was submissive to my father alone, and never needed any other voice. Always witty and fascinating, alas! My father said. Always smiling and fascinating, even when Grandma and the other daughters used the proverbial frankness, not to say bluntness of “The Hope Estate Tongues."" “My dear madam, my little wife is very dear to me! I must consider her happiness, and not my own preferences! In the Choctaw Nation, there are no conflicts, no unpleasant remarks, no strife. We are ‘Boba shilla"" with all the braves."" (Bobashilla remained a familiar word ever after at Hope Estate to signify boon friends.) “Among those quiet people, my Eliza can enjoy the calm and peace denied her here. Her health will be benefited by the change. Kindly order a hamper of delicacies"" etc.</p>
<p>
But one night, terrified negroes rushed to my father’s house for help, long after midnight. Mr. Scallan had come home drunk, and amiable as ever. Whether from madness or from a desire to divert his sobbing Eliza from her despair, he had varied his amusement by blowing his brains out in her presence. My father arrived in time to hear the shot, and to raise the corpse. He could never bear to allude to what passed. “Poor James Scallan!"" was all he ever said, save “Poor Eliza! Sad as it is, she is better so."" And so it is evident to me, even at this distance. For she learned to live for others who were more worthy of her sacrifices.. ..</p>
<p>
[Cousin Eugene was] gay, handsome, always the soul of merry making, he was an ideal youth. When the War broke out, my mother suddenly awoke to the knowledge that Eugene loved me more than our cousinship warranted. I abnormally unconscious of such preferences, was amused by her terror, and teased her to my heart’s content. Perhaps I provoked the danger and let her do the trembling. I certainly enjoyed playing with fire, I now believe. Then, I was an ignorant fool. Marry a Cousin! I would as soon marry a Brother-in-law! Such a lack of enterprise, to look to the family circle for a sweet-heart!"" I would declare. I had a good many adorers then and later – though heart whole myself. And Eugene served to keep them all awake [illegible].  Mother urged Eugene to hasten to the front of battle. He was among the first to go, with my brothers. … But Eugene was a hero. On the battlefield of the Second Manassas, Eugene died, his leg carried off by a cannon ball, and no one to rescue him. Manuel, the faithful negro, went on to identify his body and bring him home. And Manuel came to tell me how he found him in a shallow grave, wrapped in his grey blanket, a bearded man, so calm, so handsome, so restful at last! He only dug the grave deeper, and left him there. We had no means of sheltering women and children, or of transporting the wounded. Eugene sleeps well there to-day. That bearded face in the grey blanket that did not keep out the clods of earth, has always haunted me. But only mother cried. She believed she had sent him to his early death…</p>
<p>
I can hardly bear to speak of her [Aunt Caro’s] death. She died in war-ravaged Hope Estate, the day and perhaps the very hour that my brother Gibbes died on Johnson’s Island, a prisoner of war in Lake Erie, January 21, 1864. Buried in Baton Rouge in the Catholic cemetery, her grave was violated by United States troops a week later who had a ghoulish mania for dragging out gold and jewels which they suspected in every coffin. Hope Estate had neither gold nor jewels left to bury, alas, so in disgust the body of my Aunt Caro was thrown face down in the mud above and her coffin smashed beside her. I do not know that there was money-enough to pay for a second coffin, I only know that her family, going to her grave to pray for the rest of her soul found her lying there. These desecrations were not rare in the South. Only- we who suffered never care to allude to them. And the men who did the deeds do not boast of them, in their Christian Homes where they pose as Heroes, and draw substantial pay- from the vanquished, as well as from the victors, for their deeds of Derring Do in the Great Army of the Republic.</p>
<p>
…[The Hope Estate Ladies were] All widows, in my day. All in unrelieved black; all wearing the gold watch of a deceased husband, and a slender wedding ring as their sole adornment. “And of the whole, not one quite happy! No! Not one!""</p>
<p>
They were the last of a Type and of a Place forever extinct. War reduced them to poverty, and scattered them to die under strange conditions. They accepted the hardest blows with singular heroism. They never quaked before danger, violence, or suffering. They survived luxury, and ate coarse food in Christian submission. They learned to hold their peace, and to set an example of patient endurance. After all, I myself find that “The Hope Esatate Ladies"" were worthy of more praise and admiration than I am able to offer. Of such stuff, martyrs and their crowns are made!</p></blockquote>

* - Philip Hicky was born in the Manchac District (now East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana) of West Florida, the son of Daniel Hickey and Martha Scriven. He operated several large plantations in East Baton Rouge Parish including Hope Estate Plantation. Hicky married Ann Mather in 1800, and they had at least five children. As captain of cavalry in the Spanish militia, Hicky was active in the West Florida Rebellion (1810); during the War of 1812, he served as a colonel in the 11th Regiment, Louisiana Militia. He was a Louisiana state senator for a time and a trustee of the College of Baton Rouge. Hicky built the first sugar mill in East Baton Rouge Parish in 1814.

5361			CIVIL WAR SESQUICENTENNIAL: <br>The Election(s) of 1860		Miller, Randall			"<p>
By all accounts, the election of 1860 was what political scientists would later term a “critical election""--that is, an election that reflected and/or affected a significant shift in party alignments and/or brought about a significant shift in policies that reflected and/or affected political behavior thereafter, at least for a generation. Without benefit of political scientists’ methodology or terminology, the American people in 1860 understood that the election was critical and that they needed to stand up to be counted. Indeed, scholars have estimated that more than 81 percent of the eligible voters cast ballots in 1860, making it the second highest percentage turnout in American history. But what had the voters decided in 1860? That question beggared contemporaries and nagged scholars thereafter.</p>
<p>

The most critical question about the election was not who won, but whether those who had lost would accept the result. And this, more than examinations of the election itself, has been the focus of new work on the meaning of 1860. </p>
<p>

Many studies going back to Allen Nevins and continuing to recent publications have noted how threats of disunion coming from southern “fire-eaters"" in the late 1850s into the 1860 election cycle disrupted ordinary political processes and then fractured the Democratic Party, leading to the Republican electoral victory. By some accounts, especially those focusing on southern honor that result almost demanded that southerners honor their threats that any Republican gain would mean secession, lest they lose face at home and credibility in history. Whether out of a crisis of fear after John Brown’s raid and “northern"" triumph at the polls and/or anger and frustration at their diminishing political prospects in Washington, white southerners gave the day to the secessionists in the other elections of 1860—namely, those choosing delegates to the secession conventions in the deep South. In doing so, they in effect decided that they owed no loyalty to an electoral process that had sustained the republic since the first contested elections of Washington’s and Jefferson’s day. They set about “electing"" a new government in forming a Confederate States of America and urging other states to join them. All this is almost consensus among historians, though they sometimes differ over the details and daily dynamics of the secession process.</p>
<p>

Scholars essaying the election also note two vital facts that undermined defeated southerners’ willingness to accept Lincoln’s “authority"" as president-elect or even the legitimacy of his election. One fact was that Lincoln’s election owed entirely to northern votes. Boding ill for acceptance of any Republican victory in the national election was the refusal of deep southern states even to have Republican electors on a ballot. Not surprisingly, Lincoln did not win a single slave state or even a majority in any congressional district in one. A second and related problem was that Lincoln “won"" with less than 40 percent of the popular vote, and with not so much as one vote in many southern districts. As a minority president who gained the Electoral College victory on a regional vote, Lincoln hardly had a political claim to southern acceptance of his victory. He did have a constitutional one, which secessionists refused to respect. But it would be fears of a supposedly antislavery president and party more than the circumstances of Lincoln’s election that caused secessionists to win their own elections to take their states out of the Union before Lincoln could be inaugurated and do any damage to their interests. Again, on that subject, scholars generally agree. </p>
<p>

Less agreement comes when considering Lincoln’s actions as president-elect to secure his election. The initiative came from seceding southern states that did not even wait on Lincoln’s inauguration to reject the results of the election. As president-elect, Lincoln sought to arrest the process of secession by giving reassurances to the South that his administration posed no direct threat to slavery and southern interests. On December 22, 1860, he wrote as much in a private letter to his erstwhile friend and former Whig colleague Alexander Stephens of Georgia that “Do the people of the South really entertain the fears that a Republican administration would, directly or indirectly, interfere with their slaves, or with them, about their slaves? If they do, I wish to assure you, as once a friend, and still, I hope not an enemy, that there is no cause for such fears. The South would be in no more danger in this respect, than it was in the days of Washington."" The letter was somewhat disingenuous for Lincoln surely knew that Republicans in power would try to confine slavery and otherwise limit its growth and power, as was their principal reason-for-being and the expectation of those northerners who had voted for them in 1860. But it was also an honest effort to convince supposedly non-radical southerners to let the political process play out normally and thereby to buy time for unionism to reassert itself. Doing so would give the nation a chance to accept the result of the election rather than coming apart over it. Whether Lincoln bet too much on supposed southern unionists rallying to reverse the secession tide is an issue much debated among scholars. Just so in considering the extent to which Lincoln actually believed his words and actions—really non-actions—would work. </p>
<p>

As efforts to bring the seceded states back into the Union failed during the “secession winter"" and as a crisis loomed at Fort Sumter, Lincoln was sworn in as president and Republicans took their seats in a Congress that, with members of the seceded states now gone, gave them a party majority. How they managed such a transition to power is the subject of some debate among historians, though surprisingly little recent work has examined that process and its implications for translating an electoral “victory"" into Republican policy. Seemingly, though, the Republicans had “won"" the election.</p.
<p>

But, to judge by recent work on Lincoln taking office, Lincoln knew he had to make a case for the necessity of recognizing and respecting the result of the election in a way that did not emphasize Republican triumph. In his March 4, 1861, inaugural address he sought again to allay southern fears about Republican intentions by insisting that they would respect the Constitution and make no aggressive moves against the South, while also declaring the illegality and impracticality of secession and promising that the Union would defend its fundamental interest in self-preservation.  More important, he explained why it was necessary for southerners to accept the result of the election when he observed that “Plainly, the central idea of secession, is the essence of anarchy."" Once begun, it can have no end, and the great experiment in self-government that God anointed and history required would collapse. The election of 1860 thus was about the validity, credibility, and sustainability of the electoral process itself.</p>
<p>

Circumstances and events ended any prospect of secessionists honoring the election result. The seceded states had no interest in returning to a Union that they believed fundamentally had rejected their interests in protecting slavery, and the necessity of legitimating their own new government soon drove them to seize federal property and then to attack Fort Sumter. And the war came.</p>
<p>

For contemporaries and many historians, the ordeal by fire that came in 1861 defined the meaning of the election(s) of 1860. Many historians have focused on the causes and consequences of southern fears about an “impending crisis"" over slavery and explained the election(s) in terms of southern preoccupations more than northern concerns. Also, many studies have taken the long view of the election, examining, for example, the rise and fall of the second American party system, the emergence of a distinctly (and increasingly abrasive) sectional politics in the 1850s, and the simultaneous groundswell of anti-partyism among fire-eating southerners and antislavery northerners that made political compromise anathema. Such studies showed the structural failures in an American party system designed to keep the divisive slavery issue out of public discourse and electoral considerations and a culture of politics that thrived on pugnacious electioneering, conspiracy theories, and personality over principle.</p>
<p>

Although scholars have disagreed on any “inevitability"" about the crack-up as occurred in 1860-1861 or about the extent to which non-party or anti-party radicals disrupted the political system to the point where it was incapable of righting itself amid a decade of sectional rancor, those scholars generally have framed discussion of the election(s) of 1860 in dialectics, with the initiatives principally coming from southern demands for slavery’s expansion and protection and the reactions from northerners increasingly adamant to assert their own “free soil"" and other interests by the late 1840s (David Goldfield in<i> America Aflame </i>almost alone places the onus on a northern evangelical moralism starting and impelling distrust and disunion). Doing so has made understanding southern fears seemingly more important than northern ones. And it has left the focus on the election(s) of 1860 largely a matter of explaining how the war came rather than how contemporaries understood and acted on their interests in those elections. It also has discounted the importance of intraparty differences and internal struggles within the states, especially northern ones, in explaining the successes of particular Republicans and Democrats at the polls and southern secession afterward. </p>
<p>

To be sure, scholars such as Eric Foner, William Gienapp, Tyler Anbinder, and others re-oriented the focus on politics toward considerations of northern political identities and interests. They did so by showing that northerners pushed their own initiatives in trying to contain a “slave power"" and defined themselves in terms of the “free soil"" principles that created and held together a Republican party in the 1850s and even informed northern Democratic politics at the same time. In their telling, the North-South dialectic derived its energy from northern as much as southern imperatives and impulses. And the stakes were so high that “the people"" turned out to vote for their interest in record numbers. Such interest carried with it ever greater expectations that the men who sought their votes would act on them, with manly courage and without hesitation or equivocation. They expected elections to bring results. This was as true for northerners as for southerners. </p>
<p>

What is needed now is a fuller exploration of those northern interests and imperatives. Recent work by Adam Goodheart, Harold Holzer, Douglas Egerton, and especially Russell McClintock has emphasized the energy and anger of northerners, who organized as Wide-Awakes and other political clubs to press for Republican victory and then to demand that Republicans make no concessions to southerners refusing to respect that victory. Scholars remind us that the election of 1860 was in fact many elections—the presidential one conducted in the South between a split Democratic party, with Stephen A. Douglas and John C. Breckinridge pitted against one another, the one in the border states where the Union party sought to keep a peace by beating Republicans and Democrats of all stripes, and the one in the northern states between the Douglas Democrats and the Republicans. We know much about those particular contests, but what is not so well understood is how the elections worked out, on the ground, in the northern states and how the expectations coming from the many state and local elections defined and directed what people demanded of winner and loser alike. It was not only southerners who viewed the election as a test of union and honor. </p>
<p>

Thinking about the election(s) of 1860 in more local terms will help make sense of its national significance and will enlarge the scope of inquiry to give northern ideas and interests equal consideration in explaining how and why the consequences of the election(s) of 1860 proved so difficult to contain within traditional political categories. It also will take the focus of the election(s) of 1860 from preoccupations with political elites to examinations of the people on the ground. Doing so will provide the kind of people’s history for the politics of the day that will help make sense of what people wanted and expected the election to realize, whether on the winning or losing side.</p>

5669			Civil War Treasures: <br>Love Is a Battlefield:  Courtship and Marriage in the Civil War		Laver, Tara			"<p>
Confederate nurse Kate Cumming observed that the Civil War was “certainly ours as well as that of the men.""  Though she undoubtedly meant to convey that women were not immune to the harshness and devastating effects of war, a less extreme arena in which women and men shared a common wartime experience was on the battlefield of love.   And as with many other social institutions, the Civil War affected traditional customs surrounding courtship and marriage.  In honor of Valentine’s Day, this “Treasures"" column focuses on those changes.</p>
<p>
In addition to contributing to mobilization and the ongoing war effort by forming aid societies, sewing and knitting clothing and articles for soldiers, raising money, nursing, and visiting the wounded, women wielded another mobilizing weapon-- affection.   Popular songs and poems, peer pressure, and their own sense of patriotism led many unmarried women to favor soldiers over those who did not fight.   As Louisianan Amelia Faulkner wrote a friend, ""girls ought to have nothing but soldiers for their beaux and if all girls thought as we do, there would be more companies leave this state."" Further, she offered to find her a beau from among the men where where she lived, ""all soldiers, too, for I your friend would offer you nothing else."" <sup>1</sup></p>
<p>

Nineteenth-century antebellum America put a premium on the traditional roles of wife and mother.  In the South, the expectation that white women would marry was even more acute; unmarried women were out of place in a societal hierarchy that supported slavery, and there were few acceptable options for southern women outside of the bonds of matrimony.    When the Civil War broke out, many couples married quickly before a fiancé left for battle. The impending departure of a suitor for the scene of war might also heighten affection.  For example, after Abigail Kent received an unexpected visit from her suitor she wrote, “Before he was dragged off into this war, I think I appeared sufficiently indifferent,"" but, she further confided , “now I show him my true feelings for  fear that each meeting will be our last.""<sup>2</sup> </p>
<p>

The influx of soldiers from across the South, as well as the North, brought young women into close contact with potential suitors about whom they knew little. But the threat of becoming an “old maid"" trumped tradition, leading many to marry after making only a short acquaintance, and without familial blessings.   The romance of Joanna Painter Fox and George Waddill provides an illustrative example of how the rules of courtship and interaction between the sexes became more lax.  Fox, a Natchez native who served as a Confederate nurse, met George Waddill, a druggist from Baton Rouge, at the hospital in Lauderdale, Mississippi, where they both worked.  The couple had known each other at most a year before they wed, and Fox’s mother had not met the prospective groom. She broke the news to her mother:</p>

<blockquote>Mother, I have news to tell you which I hope you won’t blame me for.  I was married last month on 26th to the one I have spoke to you so often about but then I did not think of marrying until this was was over btu we both changed our mnds and married while Billy was with us.  The ceremony was read by W.C. Harris, an old friend form home and now a stationed Preacher at this place or near here.  Ma the only thing that worries me is that you did not see us married.<sup>3</sup></blockquote></p>
<p>

Such haste could have disastrous consequences, as the story Frank Adams related to his sister illustrates.  He wrote of a Confederate officer who, after his death, was found to have married several women in Louisiana as the army moved around the state.  He adds, “I have heard of at least a dozen of the same kind.""<sup>4</sup>  These polygamist soldiers took advantage of the nomadic life the war fostered.</p>
<p>

If the war brought greater acceptance of marriage after brief acquaintances, emancipation and Federal officials’ efforts to regulate the marriage of freedmen  also provided an opportunity for slave couples to formalize existing relationships.  For former slaves, participation in legal marriage was also an early assertion of freedom.  Like many freed slaves, Nancy and Ceasar Coleman, who worked on Edward J. Gay’s Plaquemine, La., plantation, sought to legalize their relationship by officially marrying through the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands. The certificate shown here is one of 55 such certificates in the collection, all dated June 7 or June 11, 1864.</p>
<p>
The examples given here are just a sampling of the resources available in Special Collections on the subject of courtship and marriage during the Civil War.  One, the rediscovered Civil War letters in the Gras-Lauzin Papers, which are cited here, have recently been made available online through the Louisana Digital Library.   Comprised of 71 letters written to Henrietta Lauzin of West Baton Rouge, principally from her friend Amelia Faulkner and Confederate soldiers Francis F. Palms and Frank Babin, they provide a very focused resource for relationships between men and women in wartime.  </p>

5590			CIVIL WAR SESQUICENTENNIAL: <br> The Lost Cause		Foster, Gaines			"<p>
Fascination with the Lost Cause seems to know no end—at least among historians, who keep publishing books on the topic.   Since at least the 1940s, the topic has attracted many scholars, who, like Robert Penn Warren, seem to have concluded that “at the moment of death the Confederacy entered upon its immortality.""   Studies of the Lost Cause have proliferated not only because historians seem to agree with Warren but because of trends within their profession.   In the 1960s, many southern historians assumed that the study of myths and symbols offered the best way to understand the “Mind of the South,"" and the Lost Cause fit naturally into such an approach.   In the last few decades, among historians, myth has given way to memory.   Indeed, the study of memory, how people interpret events and how that interpretation then shapes behavior in the present, has become a near obsession among historians and many other scholars in the humanities.  The combination of persistent interest in an old topic and new terminology no doubt has spurred even greater scholarly attention to the Lost Cause—what they now call the South’s memory of the Civil War, how people understood it and how that understanding shaped southern society and identify.</p>
<p>
Most of the scholarship on the Lost Cause has focused on the period from the end of the Civil War to roughly the beginning of World War I.   During these years, when Confederate veterans’ reunions drew crowds to rival modern day Superbowls and most of the Confederate statues, which remain so iconic for at least some southerners and many journalists, went up, the Lost Cause unquestionably served an important cultural function within the South.   Scholars have reached a fair amount of agreement about the role the Lost Cause played in those years, although the scholarship on the Lost Cause, like the memory itself, remains contested.</p>
<p>
The white South, most agree, dedicated enormous effort to celebrating the leaders and common soldiers of the Confederacy, emphasizing that they had preserved their and the South’s honor.   Led by their magnificent generals, particularly Lee and Jackson, the Confederates had fought heroically and well.  If not for the overwhelming numbers and resources of the North, the Confederacy might well have won.   The Lost Cause thereby served to ease white southerners’ fears for lost honor even as it offered, with its emphasis on deference to beloved leaders, a model of a hierarchical society in the midst of rapid social change and the Populists’ political revolt.  </p>
<p>
When the shapers of white southern memory turned to the cause of the conflict, they claimed Confederates had acted honorably, maintaining that secession was constitutional and a legitimate assertion of states’ rights.  They certainly denied that secession or the war had anything to do with slavery, though they quickly added that there was certainly nothing wrong with slavery.   The refusal to confront the evil of slavery or acknowledge any role for it in the conflict contributed to making the cause more honorable.  By claiming that the South did not fight to preserve slavery, white southerners also tried to deny the Confederacy’s defeat any role in justifying racial change.   Indeed, the Lost Cause served an opposite function:  it helped preserve white supremacy.  Most scholars who have studied the white South’s memory of the Civil War or the Old South conclude that both portrayed a past society in which whites were in charge and blacks faithful and subservient.  Here, as in so many ways, the vision of the past served as a model for the present and future.</p>
<p>
African Americans, South and North, again most scholars agree, crafted a very different memory of the war, a contested or counter memory, to use terms popular among scholars who write about memory.   The African American memory puts slavery at the center of the conflict and therefore contends that Union victory brought not only emancipation but a justification for an expansion of African American rights and the creation of a just and equal society.   Like the Lost Cause, the African-American memory of the Civil War celebrated the role of soldiers, in this case black Union soldiers, who played a crucial role in Union victory, thereby demonstrating their manhood and their qualification for citizenship.  </p>
<p>
Contested memories also developed in the interpretations of the image of women in the Lost Cause.   Many, particularly male, perpetuators of the Lost Cause celebrated white women’s loyalty during the war and their devoted support of the defeated Confederates after Appomattox.    The celebration of the Lost Cause thereby promoted a vision of society in which women remained supportive of and subordinate to men.   Many female proponents of the Lost Cause, particularly among southern women’s rights advocates, but other women as well, offered a contrasting interpretation of the women’s role in the war.   They emphasized how, when the men went off to fight, women took over the management of their homes and plantations and aided the war effort in various ways.  Their memory thus offered a very different image of the Confederate woman, one that encouraged women’s activism and equality rather than perpetuated more traditional female roles.</p>
<p>
If historians agree on the fundamental nature of the Lost Cause and on the existence of contested or counter memories of it as well, they still disagree on various points—that, after all, is what historians do.   One point still in dispute concerns the relative importance of veterans and women in shaping Civil War memory.   A few historians stress that women played a central role in the early stages of the creation of Confederate memory, when Ladies’ Memorial Associations and the process of mourning shaped it, and later in the years after 1910 or so, when the veterans had passed from the scene and the Sons of Confederate Veterans were not yet strong.   More historians, arguing that women are the keepers of memory, stress the crucial role women played  in the creation and persistence of the Lost Cause, pointing to the work first of the memorial associations and later that of the United Daughters of the Confederacy.</p>
<p>
Another issue in dispute is the extent of sectional reconciliation following the war.   Most early studies of the Lost Cause and those of the white northern memory of the Civil War as well argue that over time, certainly by the Spanish American War, most veterans of Blue and Gray had tacitly agreed to downplay if not ignore the issues of the war, such as slavery and the legitimacy of secession, and instead focus on the heroism and sacrifice of combat along with the difficulties and joys of camp life.  Southern and white northern veterans held these memories in common and could recognize each other’s honorable behavior—by ignoring that which had once divided them.  Such a memory thereby served as the basis for a reunion and reconciliation.   More recently historians have challenged that view; they stress that the issues of the war remained very much alive, particularly among northern soldiers who still condemned southern secession and, unlike the white South, still saw slavery at the center of the war.   These historians conclude that, though there may have been reunion, reconciliation was far from achieved.</p>
<p>
The debate over reunion and reconciliation reflects in part a deeper issue, perhaps the most important question about the Lost Cause, one on which historians have reached no agreement.   How important was the Lost Cause in shaping white southerners’ behavior?  And, how long did its influence persist?   Some historians have portrayed the Lost Cause as critically important in healing the scars of defeat and shaping the structure and nature of the society of the New South.  They admit that some white southerners never accepted defeat but conclude that most did and embraced not only reconciliation but a strong American nationalism as well.  Other historians disagree.  They portray the Lost Cause as a “civil religion"" that perpetuated a special sense of southernness, including a sense of moral superiority that continued to shape the South’s role in the nation.   Still others adopt the term nationalism and speak of a persistent Confederate or southern nationalism that shaped southern behavior well into the twentieth century.   They and other scholars note the role of Confederate symbols in the white South’s battle against the civil rights movement and federal efforts at desegregation and posit the continuing influence and power of the Lost Cause in the 1960s. </p>
<p>  
For many scholars and journalists, the idea of a persistent and powerful role for the Lost Cause extends beyond the 1960s; they claim to find in the contemporary South a widespread and deep commitment to the Lost Cause or see various examples of the white South still fighting the Civil War.  The continuing battle over the Confederate flag and other Confederate symbols would seem to support such views, although the flag fights may be even more immediately shaped by matters of race than the Lost Cause celebrations of the late nineteenth century.</p>
<p>  
The Sesquicentennial, thus far at least, seems to provide conflicting evidence about the continuing power of the Lost Cause and the centrality of the Civil War to American historical memory.   Congress, despite lobbying by various groups, has not created a commission to oversee a national commemoration of the Civil War, as it did for the centennial.  The National Park Service has pointedly sought to commemorate and not celebrate the war and has done a very good job of trying to promote a complex view of its history.  Many museums and historical societies, as well, have sponsored programs or exhibits.  Anniversary celebrations, such as those marking the firing on Fort Sumter or the battle of Gettysburg have occurred, but seem hardly as popular as one might expect.   Save for Bill O’Reilly’s Killing Lincoln—which gave birth to a “Killing"" and not a Civil War franchise—books about the Civil War have not stormed to the top of the best seller lists.</p>
<p>   
Two polls taken in conjunction with the Sesquicentennial yielded different results and do show some persistence of Civil War memory, but at least one of them also points toward a fundamental change.    A Pew Research poll found that 56 percent of Americans still think the Civil War is relevant to American political life today.  That same poll found that 48 percent of Americans, north and south, thought the war was about states’ rights and only 38 per cent said it was about slavery.  A CNN poll, released about the same time, found that 54 percent of Americans thought slavery was the main reason for the war and 42 percent said it was not.  (The difference in the two polls on the cause of the war may result from the differing ways each posed the question.  That with the higher figure for slavery as the cause did not offer “states’ rights"" as an alternative; the other did.)   Blacks remain much more likely to say that slavery was the main cause, while white southerners were less likely to say so than white northerners.   Still, these polls found that almost 49 percent of southerners said the war was mainly about slavery and that only 52 percent of them said it was appropriate for politicians to praise Confederate leaders,—percentages that would have been very different, I’m willing to wager, if a poll had been taken in 1913. </p>
<p>
Historians need to do more work on the Lost Cause, both on what happened to it between World War I and the end of the civil rights movement and on the influence of Civil War memory in the contemporary South.  Unquestionably, some whites still seem driven to preserve the memory of the Confederacy and employ it in behalf of current politics; the Sons of Confederate Veterans, for instance, have a loyal, though small, and very vocal base.  And some small minority of southerners, along with many outside the region, remains fascinated by the story of the war.   Nevertheless, slightly older polls suggest little widespread interest in the war and less public knowledge about it.   I suspect that careful analysis will show that the Lost Cause has a weaker hold on the contemporary southern imagination and less influence in shaping southern behavior than many people assume.  I am sure that some studies will disagree and that additional books will not eliminate the contested nature of the study of Civil War memory, much less convince many in the public to change their view of the Lost Cause’s  impact on the South and the nation.  That, historians of memory have taught us, is the nature of historical memory.</p>

4638			CIVIL WAR TREASURES: <br>Pondering Presidential Politics…in Private		Jewett, Leah Wood			"<p>
In the months before Lincoln’s election to the presidency in November 1860, planters and businessmen, including those surrounding James Pirrie Bowman, pondered the growing political crisis cautiously among friends and close professional associates. Though short on detail, Bowman’s correspondence gives modern readers insight into thoughts and concerns regarding the most public of politics, shared in private.</p>
<p> 
Born at Oakley Plantation in West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana in 1832, James Pirrie Bowman graduated from Yale University Medical School in 1851. He married Sarah Turnbull, daughter of the wealthy Daniel Turnbull of Rosedown Plantation, in 1857.  Bowman served as 1st Lieutenant of the 3rd Louisiana Cavalry, CSA from 1861-1865. After the war he returned to Louisiana to manage affairs at Rosedown, and Frogmoor, and Bayou Gross Tete plantations in Pointe Coupee Parish. Bowman died in 1927.</p>

<p>
My Dear Sir</p>
<p>
I am in receipt of your kind favor of the 8th inst, your punctuality in writing is a good evidence of that energy, which should characterize every man of business, and the more particularly, one like your-self, blessed with youth, health, and vigor. If, by such example, you design offering me a lesson, tis no more than the just dues of one, who has in days now past and gone taught you so many.</p>
<p>
You afford me a rather gloomy account of things in general, the more particularly in relation to your prospects on Gross Tete. The farmer, here too, and as far as known to me, is complaining of drought. In some sections tolerable crops of wheat have been realized – oats are good in all parts, and that without explanation. But corn and tobacco were suffering all kinds of exhaustion from thirst? I shall however make allowance for you knowing , as I do, your proneness to look only on the dark side of every picture. You have time plenty yet for rain, and a change more propitious to the production of sugarcane.  Never murmur at the doings of God, for the same never fail to prove the most wise, healthful and advantageous to the true interest  of his poor shortvisioned creature man.</p>
<p>
I am sorry to hear of the severe afflictions that have been visited on your little daughter, Martha, but on the contrary, there is reason for gratification and rejoicing… that she has been mercifully spared to you and her mother, and further still, that it is well with her as it was, at the time of your writing.</p>
<p>
I am more than pleased to find you taking some more than ordinary interest in politics. I think indeed tis time the Sovereigns were rising en masse, and in such capacity, asserting their rights. We now have in the field five candidates, or rather aspirants to the presidency, and not one of whom can the people find as wholly unexceptionable and true. I can not and I am frank to own, that if I had the casting of 20 votes, I could not determine for which of the five, I could safely vote. An especially sad dilemma, this, and I have a presentiment tho that there is enough of well-paired conservatism in our glorious country and happy [illegible] to preserve the Union , we are destined a position among the nations of the earth, which [illegible] hither to has attained. The old Dominion too has fallen into the common gulfs. She now stands for below what she has been, and as it were, into worse than disgrace and corruption. All here seem to have lost the true essence of Democracy. Brother is arranged against brother, nothing but division among the ranks is to be seen. Tis truly a “tangled hank Lord"" as the man said, with his ideas confused at prayer, yes – a very mixed up business indeed, say I. At this crisis all I have to say is, that my sword is drawn, ready to be used against all fanaticism, whether seen in Religion or free nigger sympathy. A vast deal of which, is manifest here, in my daily walks. At Lynchburg, the Bell <sup>1</sup> rings loud and clear. At Richmond Breckenridge <sup>2</sup> is in repute, while at Petersburg one days journey south of the Capital, Douglas <sup>3</sup> reigns supreme.</p>
<p>
We now are in the midst of summer, and that the hottest weather I ever felt, the consequence is that of very little repose for me, who are in need of all to be had. I wish I was back in La, and had never come on to this, a dreary land, to me, I am however, living as usual a temperate life, Haven’t taken a drink of <u>ardent liquid</u> since my sojourn in old faginny <sup>4</sup>, and can’t say that I ever feel a desire to do so. Please write me as often as convenient, for the writing to, and receiving letters from my friends, is my meat & drink. My kindest remembrance to your wife and all my friends as you may meet them.</p>

<p>
Rummaging in my wifes writing desk today for an envelope I came across your favor of the 27th Sept <sup>5</sup> unopened and of course unread – my regret is equal to yours at this occurrence and I trust no bad consequences will result from the mislaying of your letter – I had thought it strange that I heard no further from you in regard to your bets with Buch– I have written to Capt Pilcher in accordance with yr wishes expressed in the letter, but going a little farther than my instructions in saying to Capt Pilcher that Mr Buch must not seek a loop hole on acct of your desiring to put up a note that he must telegraph me immediately in that case and steps would be promptly taken to place sufficient funds in Nashville. I fear the elections in Delaware, Florida and Mississippi will cause Buch to crayfish if he is not of the right stripe. We keep the excitement up in this parish but it is uphill work with me since the elections of the 9th –</p>
<p> 
Pennsylvania gone leaves me without hope to beat Lincoln – and Zeb holding an office at the hands of the Democratic party – I am restrained in uttering my opinions for fear of injuring a party that has honored me so much. As for this Union in my opinion is “The silver cord is loosed and the Golden bowl is broken,"" and yet I must only whisper this…</p>

Willie sent me your letter in reference to bets made with Buch of Nashville.</p>
<p>
I congratulate you on your good fortune, believing there is no doubt but that you will win the two largest bets. The third I fear you will lose, since there is a prospect that the Douglas men will generally vote the Bell ticket.</p>

I have been at home for some two weeks and cannot help you further than to refer you to Capt M. S. Pilcher <sup>7</sup> or to my father in law S. R. Cockerell, either of whom will be happy to do you a service.</p>

Your favor of the 15th to hand – I called on Mr. L. F. Buch and made known the wishes of Mr. Bowman – he did not seem disposed to give the affair that attention, that many persons would think it deserved – merely remarking that it had been so long since the circumstance took place, that he was not disposed to have anything further to do with it – so I suppose he considers the matter at an end – you and I would call it <u>backing square out</u>.</p>

I hope your crops, these high priced times will turn out better than you anticipate d- your friends are all well- Mrs. P & Lizzie join me in kindest regards to your Mother and Lady Effie – I should like to have your views with regard to Willies <sup>8</sup> trade with Tom Sparks <sup>9</sup>– I think it a fearful undertaking – we intend putting the Brass collar on Bell & Everett <sup>10</sup> the 6th Nov. <sup>11</sup> & after the 4th March 1861 <sup>12</sup> hang every Yanceyite <sup>13</sup> in the Republic, unless they apologize.</p>

5517			CIVIL WAR TREASURES:<br>Beautiful Necessity:  Wallpaper and Confederate Imprints		Lacher-Feldman, Jessica			"<p>
Materials published during the Civil War in the Confederate states are known as Confederate imprints.  Exhaustive bibliographies and guides to these materials have been written over the years, the most widely known being <i>Confederate Imprints: A Bibliography of Southern Publications from Secession to Surrender </i>by T. Michael Parrish and Robert M. Willingham, published in 1987, and Marjorie Crandall’s <i>Confederate Imprints, 1861-1865.</i>  By reviewing these comprehensive bibliographies, we gain important insights into literary tastes of the time and the intellectual, creative, and practical output of a very specific time and place. The bibliographies also give us an increased understanding of what was being printed and used in terms of written material during the Civil War in the South.   While many of the materials published relate to the war itself, and to the operation of the Confederate government including acts and orders as well as other political documents, a need for printed matter beyond military and political publications certainly did exist.  Literature, music, newspapers, and school books all had their place in the corpus of Confederate-era publishing.</p>
<p>
What bibliographies do not tell us can really only be discovered through spending time with the material and some of the surprises it yields.  One remarkable byproduct of the scarcity of goods during this period are the few rare items we find that are printed on scraps of wallpaper.  The wallpaper, some as fresh as it was over 150 years ago, gives us a taste of hidden beauty and is a welcome surprise.</p>
<p>
LSU Libraries Special Collections holds a few wonderful examples of materials printed on wallpaper during the Confederacy.  One item, an historical novel by Luise Mühlbach entitled <i>Henry VIII and his Court,</i> was published by the Mobile, Alabama printer Sigmund H. Goetzel.  While Goetzel only published twenty-eight items in his years of operation between 1854 and 1865, several of the books that he did have remnants of wallpaper included.  The printing was done on the blank surface on the verso of the wallpaper.  The two-volume Mühlbach novel has two different wallpaper examples, both included on the inside of the book.</p>
<p>
We know from Mobile city directories and advertisements that Goetzel sold wallpaper as well as stationery and other paper goods in his shop.  Though we would like to think that the choice of using wallpaper was an aesthetic decision, it was more a matter of necessity. Paper and other goods had become increasingly scarce and wealthy Southerners were doing their best to survive so rather than choosing new wallpapers for their homes, the material was used for printing. Goetzel himself is a bit of a mystery.  A native of Austria, his life after the Civil War remains unknown. Some scholars claim that he moved to New Orleans, while others state that there is evidence that he emigrated to Brazil along with more than 10,000 Confederate Americans – the future “Confederados”.</p>
<p> 
Another interesting wallpaper example is a page from the July 2, 1863 issue of the Vicksburg, Mississippi <i>Daily Citizen,</i> part of the Eggleston-Roach Papers ( Mss. 832).  A surrogate copy of this newspaper fragment was recently included in our exhibit entitled <i>The Summer of 1863: Gettysburg, Vicksburg & Port Hudson.</i>  Again because of the lack of paper, the last issue of the Daily Citizen published before the surrender was printed on wallpaper.  It carries news of a woman, Mrs. Cisco, being killed during the bombardment and notes that her husband is serving with Moody’s Artillery in Virginia. </p>
<p>
These printed items cannot help but delight and surprise us, not only as historical artifacts and documents, but as culture artifacts and decorative objects.  Their rarity and beauty make them fascinating and important treasures indeed.</p>

4246			A NEW BIRTH OF FREEDOM: STUDYING THE LIFE OF LINCOLN<br>Abraham Lincoln at 200: A Bicentennial Survey		Williams, Frank J.			"<p>
No president has such a hold on our minds as Abraham Lincoln.  He lived at the dawn of photography, and his pine cone face made a haunting picture.  He was the best writer in all American politics, and his words are even more powerful than his images.  His greatest trial, the Civil War, was the nation’s greatest trial, and the race problem that caused it is still with us today.  His death by murder gave his life a poignant and violent climax, and allows us to play the always-fascinating game of “what if?""</p>
<p>
Abraham Lincoln did great things, greater than anything done by Theodore Roosevelt or Franklin Roosevelt.  He freed the slaves and saved the Union, and because he saved the Union he was able to free the slaves.  Beyond this, however, our extraordinary interest in him, and esteem for him, has to do with what he said and how he said it.  And much of this had to do with the Union – what it was and why it was worth saving.</p>
<p>
He saved it by fighting and winning the war, of course.  But his initial step in this was the decision to go to war – not a popular decision, and certainly not an easy one.  His predecessor, the incompetent James Buchanan, believed that the states had no right to secede from the Union, but that there was nothing he could do about it if they did.  Thus, by the time Lincoln took office, seven Southern states had seceded, and nothing had been done about it.  Led by South Carolina, they claimed to be doing only what the original colonies had done in 1776.  To oppose them might bring on the war, and Buchanan had no stomach for this.</p>
<p>
Lincoln knew that the time had come when the only way to save the Union was to go to war.  But could he say so and retain the support of the people who had voted for him?  For abolitionists, slavery was a sin, and the slaveholders sinners.  But their leading spokesman, William Lloyd Garrison, was no friend of the Union.  He said the Constitution was “a covenant with death and an agreement with hell.""  During the Fort Sumter crisis, Garrison said “all Union saving efforts are simply idiotic."" </p>
<p>
It is not by chance that one of Lincoln’s best speeches was delivered on a battlefield on the occasion of dedicating a cemetery for those who fought, died, and were buried there. We remember: Lincoln said that the brave men, living and dead, who struggled on this ground, this battlefield, had “consecrated"" it better than he or anyone else could.  Their cause was great and noble. We also remember Lincoln saying that their work was “unfinished,"" and that we, the living, should “highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain – that this nation under god, shall have a new birth of freedom,"" and that government of, by and for the people “shall not perish from the earth."" </p>
<p>
We remember everything he said.  And we remember it because he took great pains to say things beautifully. </p>
<p>
We also remember his second inaugural address, especially the concluding paragraph – the poignant beauty of it: </p>
<p>
<blockquote>With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation’s wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan – to do all which may achieve and cherish a just, and a lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations.</blockquote></p>
<p>
Six weeks later he was murdered.  We say that a man can be known by the company he keeps.  A nation can be known and judged by its heroes whom it honors above all others.  We pay ourselves the greatest compliment when we say that Abraham Lincoln is that man for us.  
So, we celebrate the bicentennial of his birth with fanfare and reverence.  After 200 years, he still looks good.</p>
<p>
In 1922, H. L. Mencken was told by a publisher “there are four kinds of books that never, under any circumstances, lose money in the United States – first, detective stories; secondly, novels in which the heroine is forcibly debauched by the hero; thirdly, volumes on spiritualism, occultism and other such claptrap; and fourthly, books on Lincoln.""</p>
<p>
Times change.  So do profits and losses at publishing houses – but not, apparently, when you are talking about books about Abraham Lincoln.  An epochal American event – his 200th birthday – is being marked by an inundation of new Lincoln books the likes of which few of us have ever seen.  Here are some of the 100 books published in the last two years – at the rate of one a week.</p>
<p>
<i>Angels and Ages: A Short Book About Darwin, Lincoln and Modern Life</i> by Adam Gopnik (Knopf).  What happened February 12, 1809, that changed the world wasn’t merely the birth, in a log cabin on Nolin Creek in Kentucky, of Abraham Lincoln.  In one of those incredible happenstances that either validate astrology or the miracles of coincidence, on the same day half a world away on an English country estate was born Charles Darwin, whose theory of evolution would transform scientific thought just as Lincoln’s presidency would transform all ideas about democracy.  Adam Gopnik has brilliantly taken it upon himself to “connect the dots"" in the larger picture of the famously bearded giants given to the world on February 12, 1809. </p>
<p>
<i>The Lincoln Anthology: Great Writers on His Life and Legacy from 1860 to Now </i>edited by Harold Holzer (Library of America).  This is one of the best books in the Lincoln flood and one of the best ever from the invaluable Library of America.  In its near-1,000 pages is a treasure trove of words about Abraham Lincoln – not just from American sources from Emerson to E.L. Doctorow but from foreigners like Karl Marx, Winston Churchill, Henrik Ibsen, Victor Hugo, Bram Stoker, Leo Tolstoy and H. G. Wells, too.</p>
<p>
An ailing Tolstoy, quoted by Count S. Staklberg, said of Lincoln: “of all the great national heroes and statesmen of history, Lincoln is the only real giant.  Alexander, Frederick the Great, Caesar, Napoleon, Gladstone and even Washington stand in greatness of character, in depth of feeling and in certain moral power far behind Lincoln.""</p>
<p>
In April 1865, soon after Abraham Lincoln’s assassination, Ralph Waldo Emerson eulogized the recently slain President as “thoroughly American – a quite native, aboriginal man, as an acorn from an oak, no aping of foreigners, no frivolous accomplishments.""  Seventeen years later, Walt Whitman lauded Lincoln as the American among Americans, “his times, his death – great as any, any age – belong altogether to our own.""</p>
<p>
Most of the writers agree with Holzer that Lincoln, while complex and self-contradictory, “has remained nothing less than the ideal American hero: the self-made Everyman.""  He considers Lincoln’s “legacy of extraordinary resonance and universality.""</p>

<p>
A leading Lincoln scholar, Holzer arranges the excerpts chronologically, from William Cullen Bryant’s <i>Introduction of Abraham Lincoln at Cooper Union </i>(1860), to E. L. Doctorow’s novel <i>The March</i> (2005).  The authors include the famous and the obscure – newspapermen, humorists, biographers, essayists, novelists, memoirists, poets, playwrights, historians, clergymen and statesmen. </p>
<p>
In a brief epilogue, Holzer features Barack Obama, whose identification with Lincoln brings the story up to February 2007.  Announcing his presidential candidacy in Illinois, Obama invoked Lincoln’s memory, reminding his audience that “the life of a tall, gangly, self-made Springfield lawyer tells us that a different future is possible."" </p>
<p>
<i>The Portable Abraham Lincoln</i>, edited by Andrew Delbanco (Penguin), is an essential American book, to be enjoyed along with <i>The Lincoln Anthology’s</i> offering of other voices on the subject of Lincoln.  Said Edmund Wilson of Lincoln, the writer: “his own style was cunning in its cadences, exact in its choice of words, and yet also instinctive and natural; and it was inseparable from his personality in all its manifestations.""  All the obvious choices are here, but see also Lincoln’s 1864 draft of a letter to ardent unionist Isaac M. Schermerhorn who invited Lincoln to a “Union Mass Meeting"" in Buffalo.  Agree to armistice, Lincoln writes, and “the insurgents would be in peaceful possession of all that has been struggled for.""  Therefore, no armistice.</p>
<p>
“So much mythology, and so much iconography, and so many books!"" remarks Fred Kaplan, of the City University of New York’s Queens College, whose own contribution, <i>Lincoln: The Biography of a Writer</i>, (HarperCollins), is the first close study of how crucial Lincoln’s vast reading and writing were to his political ascent.  </p>
<p>
Still warm off the presses are books about Lincoln’s struggles with race, with his marriage, and with his melancholia; about his law practice; and about his creation of the role of commander in chief.  Even the influence of the Scottish poet Robert Burns on the young Lincoln and the surprising parallels in their lives get an airing.  (<i>Abraham Lincoln and Robert Burns: Connected Lives and Legends</i> by Ferenc Szasz Southern Illinois University Press.)  All that, and one major new biography plus three mini-biographies.</p>
<p>
Much of the new work goes down well-trodden trails.  Take Lincoln’s epochal 1858 debates about slavery with Senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois.  In a new edition of the encounters, <i>The Lincoln-Douglas Debates</i> (University of Illinois Press), Rodney O. Davis and Douglas L. Wilson, directors of the Lincoln Studies Center at Knox College, in Galesburg, Illinois, do more than any predecessors to reconcile conflicting accounts from rival newspapers.  Allen Guelzo’s <i>Lincoln and Douglas: The Debates That Defined America</i> (Simon and Schuster) describes the times and critical issues of the day and the debates. </p>
<p>
Douglas kept his seat but Lincoln gained national prominence, leading to an invitation to speak in New York to the eastern Republican establishment.  The effect of his speech at the Cooper Union in New York moved him to the forefront of candidates for the Republican nomination for the presidency. </p>
<p>
Other fine-detailed discoveries are yielding immediate returns.  James Oakes in <i>The Radical and the Republican: Frederick Douglass, Abraham Lincoln, and the Triumph of Antislavery Politics</i> (W.W. Norton) shows that two little-noted speeches by Frederick Douglass reveal that he was more sympathetic than previously thought toward Lincoln’s cautious inching toward support for some black suffrage.  Douglass would remember in 1876, when asked to reflect on Lincoln’s legacy: “Though Mr. Lincoln shared the prejudices of his white fellow-countrymen against the Negro, it is hardly necessary to say that in his heart of hearts he loathed and hated slavery."" </p>
<p>
Landmark biographers of Lincoln are many: Carl Sandburg (1926, 1939), James G. Randall (1945-55), Benjamin P. Thomas (1952), Stephen B. Oates (1977), and David Herbert Donald (1995), to name just five.  In any case, biographers can hardly shirk inspecting Lincoln’s mind when so much of his revolutionary contribution to American life stemmed from his moral sensibilities.  For its nuanced view of such key aspects of Lincoln’s leadership, Ronald C. White Jr.’s new <i>A. Lincoln: A Biography</i> (Random House) has been praised expansively.  White’s work is lengthy at 797 pages, but its deft writing will appeal to academic and general readers alike.  (It appeared on the March 1 and 8, 2009 <i>New York Times</i> bestseller list.) </p>
<p>
George E. McGovern, former U.S. Senator and Ph.D. historian knows something about presidential leadership.  In <i>Abraham Lincoln</i> (Times), a compact portrait, he assesses Lincoln’s greatness in terms of his ability to use his humble origins, empathy, keen sense of justice, and faith in American democracy to become a master lawyer, party leader and commander in chief.  James M. McPherson’s <i>Abraham Lincoln</i> (Oxford), also concise, gives a rich and perceptive biography of a Lincoln influenced by union and freedom. </p>
<p>
Lincoln’s long career in law has become more visible thanks to the first part of an enormous project, <i>The Papers of Abraham Lincoln</i>, undertaken by the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency.  The University of Illinois Press published the papers from Lincoln’s legal practice on DVD in 2000, <i>The Law Practice of Abraham Lincoln: Complete Documentary Edition</i> edited by Martha L. Benner and Cullom Davis, and the state agency later put them into a searchable online database.  In 2008, the University of Virginia Press published a four-volume boxed set of selected Lincoln court cases edited by Daniel W. Stowell and others.  </p>
<p>
The Illinois Historic Preservation Agency, in pursuing its documentation project, has dispatched a team of researchers to pour over every likely repository in the county.  In about 2013, the agency will issue papers covering Lincoln’s birth to his inauguration, and by about 2020 it will release his presidential papers – not just everything he wrote, but also everything of any importance that was written to him.  The project is already casting light on details of Lincoln’s legacy, such as his presidential governing of the District of Columbia.  Still, the record and scholarship on the 16th President are already so vast, can we expect such delving to bring in major revisions of the Lincoln story? </p>
<p>
Along with much documentary work has come new stock-taking of controversies of recent decades.  What kind of religious person was Lincoln?  (More than Washington and Jefferson, who were essentially deists.)  Was he a racist?  (A pragmatist who presided over a war he did not want but which “created the conditions that allowed him to write the emancipation proclamation,"" says Kaplan.)  Was he gay?  (Unlikely, despite much speculation during the 1990s.)  Was his wife, Mary Todd Lincoln, as horrid as their marriage was horrible?  (Increasingly, clearly, yes, no and maybe.) </p>
<p>
Narrowly tailored studies abound in the new literature.  Harold Holzer, co-chairman of the U.S. Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission, is winning praise for a fresh take on Lincoln’s activities between his election and inauguration.  Holzer makes a compelling case that the President-elect was no ditherer, but rather shrewd and principled as he waged war to prevent Southern secession and end slavery in <i>Lincoln President Elect: Abraham Lincoln and the Great Secession Winter 1860-1861</i> (Simon & Schuster).</p>
<p>
Of new interest is <i>Lincoln’s Men: The President and His Private Secretaries</i>, by Daniel Mark Epstein (HarperCollins).  Of the three secretaries to serve during Lincoln’s presidency, the best-known is John Hay, who later became a successful diplomat and businessman.  In crisp and occasionally wry prose, Epstein shows how Lincoln was seen by those closer to him than anyone outside his immediate family. </p>
<p>
Lincoln’s attitude toward African-Americans is still parsed and contested.  Many believe the epithet of “Great Emancipator"" is well-earned, but some consider him essentially racist.  In a thoughtful introduction to <i>Lincoln on Race and Slavery</i> (Princeton), Henry Louis Gates, Jr. details the steady evolution of Lincoln’s thinking, from his early opposition to slavery on economic rather than humanitarian grounds to arguing, in the last speech of his life, that at least some black men should have the right to vote. </p>
<p>
At first glance, <i>Abraham Lincoln: Great American Historians on our Sixteenth President</i> (Public Affairs) seems little more than the cobbled-together interviews from C-SPAN.  But it boasts wonderful little treasures, including the laments of iconoclasts like Lerone Bennett Jr. and Thomas DiLorenzo about getting stiff-armed by the pro-Lincoln establishment.  Taken together, such commentary becomes a virtual biography of Abraham Lincoln. </p>
<p>
The legacy of Abraham Lincoln is measured in both deeds and words.  The 16th President was a regular sound-bite machine, uttering such memorable words as “with malice toward none and charity for all,"" and “that government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth."" </p>
<p>
In the new collection <i>In Lincoln’s Hand</i>, edited by Joshua Wolf Shenk and Harold Holzer (Bantam), a panel of writers, artists – even all our past presidents – were each assigned one of Lincoln’s original manuscripts and asked to write a commentary.  The manuscripts show how Lincoln used common language to reach a broader audience; the comments show how such words have influenced men and women of letters and power alike. </p>
<p>
Recently published is <i>The Lincolns, Portrait of a Marriage</i> (Ballantine Books), by Daniel Mark Epstein.  Epstein provides a fresh look at the Lincolns’s marriage, portraying it as more loving than have other writers. </p>
<p>
The story of Mary Todd Lincoln after the assassination is a tragic one.  There has been no letup of works on her eccentricities and her later commitment to an institution by her son Robert.  A recent account is Jason Emerson’s <i>The Madness of Mary Lincoln</i> (Southern Illinois University Press).   </p>
<p>
While in New Salem, Lincoln began to study law on his own.  He passed the Illinois bar examination in 1836 and left to work as a lawyer in Springfield.  Over the next 24 years, primarily through his work on the eighth Illinois judicial circuit, he became one of the most respected attorneys in central Illinois.  Much of Lincoln’s approach to his later actions as President of the United States was grounded in his hands-on experience with the law.  <i>Lincoln the Lawyer</i> by Brian Dirck (University of Illinois Press) gives a realistic view of what it was like to be a lawyer in Illinois at this time.  And Mark Steiner, in <i>An Honest Calling: The Law Practice of Abraham Lincoln</i>, (Northern Illinois University Press), tells us that Lincoln the lawyer was “busy, busy,"" and supported alternative dispute resolution before that term was invented. </p>
<p>
Lincoln’s dealings with the Supreme Court were important, since he needed the Court’s approval to uphold many of the actions he took to hold the nation together during the Civil War.  Brian McGinty analyzed his relations with the Court in detail in <i>Lincoln and the Court</i> (Harvard University Press). </p>
<p>
Has any wartime leader ever spent so much time thinking about the sacrifices of the dead and their meaning?  Two new books describing Lincoln’s role as commander in chief are James McPherson’s <i>Tried By War: Abraham Lincoln as Commander in Chief</i> (Oxford) and Craig L. Symonds’s <i>Lincoln and His Admirals</i> (Oxford) – both of whom share this year’s Lincoln Prize. </p>
<p>
The best description of the administrative acumen of the President is found in Doris Kearns Goodwin’s <i>Team of Rivals</i> (Simon & Schuster).  This is a superb biography of Lincoln and his major cabinet members.  Most members of the Lincoln administration have earned biographies of their own as well. </p>
<p>
The most important, controversial, and far-reaching document issued by President Lincoln was the Emancipation Proclamation.  Burrus Carnahan’s <i>Act of Justice: Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation and the Law of War</i> (University Press of Kentucky) and Brian Dirck’s edited collection <i>Lincoln Emancipated</i> (Northern Illinois University) gave fair, up-to-date reviews of Lincoln’s attitudes toward race.  An offshoot of Lincoln’s moral approach to slavery has been an upsurge in interest in Lincoln’s overall approach to religion, resulting in several recent books, including Michael Burkhimer’s <i>Lincoln’s Christianity</i> (Westholme). </p>
<p>
Shortly after the surrender of General Robert E. Lee ended the Civil War, President Lincoln was tragically assassinated.  New books have appeared and will continue to appear covering the events and implications of the murder.  An excellent overall view of the deed may be found in Anthony S. Pitch’s <i> “They Have Killed Papa Dead!"" The Road to Ford’s Theatre, Abraham Lincoln’s Murder, and the Rage of Vengeance</i> for Steerforth Press.  Most books on the assassination deal with John Wilkes Booth and his co-conspirators, their pursuit and capture as in James L. Swanson’s terrific read for young people, <i>Chasing Lincoln’s Killer</i> (Scholastic).  In another documentation project, the University of Illinois Press, in 2009, published the evidence gathered for the Lincoln assassination trials, much of which the court never viewed.  <i>The Lincoln Assassination: The Evidence</i>, edited by William C. Edwards and Edward Steers. </p> 
<p>
Several scholars have recently compiled books on Lincoln’s writings and unique way of expressing his thoughts.  Examples include books by Douglas L. Wilson, <i>Lincoln’s Sword: The Presidency and the Power of Words</i> (Knopf), and Ronald C. White, Jr.’s <i>The Eloquent President: A Portrait of Lincoln through His Words</i> (Random House). </p>
<p>
Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address and his second inaugural address have also received particular attention.  Gabor Borrit’s <i>The Gettysburg Gospel: The Lincoln Speech That Nobody Knows</i> (Simon & Schuster) is a definitive appraisal of the speech and its impact.  Ron White does the same for Lincoln’s second inaugural address in <i>Lincoln’s Greatest Speech</i> (Simon & Schuster). </p>
<p>
Librarians should also be aware of the recent availability of Lincoln’s speeches and letters in electronic format.  The Library of Congress has long had the largest collection of Lincoln’s writings, and has published fragments from them over the years.  Recently, the Library of Congress National Digital Library Program and the Manuscript Division announced the released of their Abraham Lincoln Papers in digital format at <i>Abraham Lincoln: A Resource Guide</i> (www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/presidents/lincoln/external.html). </p>
<p>
More has been written about Abraham Lincoln than any other American historical figure – over 16,000 books and pamphlets, but no one is deterred from adding to the flood of information about our 16th and greatest President.  One reason is that his personal story – the rise from poverty to power – is quintessentially American, and he as much as anyone embodied the national myth of the self-made man.  Another is that the political story – his opposition to the Mexican War, his famous debates with Stephen A. Douglas, his election to the presidency and his leadership during the Civil War – revolves around an issue ever close to the surface of national life: race.  Add to these the recent election of a president who consciously evokes Lincoln’s image and example, and the timing seems auspicious. </p>
<p>
In 1922 Robert R. Moton, Booker T. Washington’s successor at Tuskegee Institute, drafted a speech on behalf of blacks for the dedication of Washington’s Lincoln Memorial, warning that the memorial would remain “but a hollow mockery, a symbol of hypocrisy, unless we together can make real the principles for which Lincoln died.  Though the Memorial Commission ultimately forced Moton to excise his sharp words, his speech nevertheless ended with a cry for “equal justice and equal opportunity for all.""  The election of President Obama and his words at the Capitol arguably bring this quest to fruition. </p>
<p>
In a Lincoln Bicentennial Celebration held at the Capitol on February 12, President Barack Obama paid his respects to a man he said “made America’s story possible.""  Obama, who has spoken frequently about how Lincoln inspires him, has praised the 16th President as a transcendent figure who came to “represent so much of who we are as a people and so much of what we aspire to be."" </p>
<p>
Obama, who, on January 20, was sworn as America’s 44th President on the same Bible used at his 1861 inauguration by his idol, often invokes Lincoln and has said he takes heart in confronting the current daunting challenges from the example set by his hero.  President Obama said: “What Lincoln never forgot, not even in the midst of civil war, was that despite all that divides us – north and south, black and white – we were, at the heart, one nation and one people, sharing a bond as Americans that could bend but would not break . . . I feel great gratitude to this singular figure who in so many ways made my own story possible, and in so many ways made America’s story possible."" </p>
<p>
In the closing statement, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said: “Let us take our lead from Lincoln.  Abraham Lincoln knew that the preservation of the union was a fight for the ideals of the Declaration of Independence.  As he said ‘At stake was not just the future of our nation, but the future of people throughout the world’."" </p>
<p>
“Before this year-long celebration ends, we will see major conferences on Lincoln from Springfield to South Florida, to Oxford and Belfast, and from Howard University to Harvard,"" said Senator Dick Durbin, the dean of lawmakers of the Illinois delegation.  Devotees like Durbin love pointing out that in all of recorded history, only Jesus Christ has been the subject of more books. </p>
<p>
Not that there wasn’t any controversy surrounding Lincoln.  “He became a figure that transcended human experience, but was a very controversial figure, criticized for his positions on slavery,"" said historian Marc Miccozzi, a former director of the National Museum of Health and Medicine, where some Lincoln artifacts are on display. </p>
<p>
But part of Lincoln’s appeal comes from the fact that he embodies the American myth that anyone, however humble their beginnings, can ultimately attain the highest office in the land.  What historian Gabor Boritt has called, “the right to rise.""  Born and raised in poverty in Kentucky wilderness, he became a Mississippi River boat ferryman, country lawyer, and later Illinois legislator.  Yes, the man about whom so many scholars have spilled ink, penned only a thin two-page autobiography when asked to write about himself.  “There is not much of it, for the reason, I suppose, that there is not much of me,"" said Lincoln, a picture of unsurpassed modesty. </p>
<p>
Pulitzer Prize-winner Doris Kearns Goodwin, Harold Holzer, and Matthew Pinsker were the historians who conducted a live, online “teach-in"" about Abraham Lincoln on February 12.  The program has been archived at www.history.com/lincoln/ and at www.abrahamlincoln200.org. </p>
<p>
Americans can’t get enough of Lincoln – especially now, having elected an African American President in the midst of an economic crisis.  They can’t stop arguing about what made Lincoln great, what he would have done if he had not been assassinated six weeks into his second term, what he would do if he were alive today.  Each year, millions of visitors mount the steps of The Lincoln Memorial, gaze at the statue of this American Zeus and read his immortal words, carved into the walls. </p>
<p>
Yet, on his 200th birthday, the monolithic, mythic Lincoln – the barefoot boy who studied by candlelight and became “honest Abe,"" “the rail splitter"" – is fragmented into an array of competing and contrasting Lincolns.  Some are verifiable, others theoretical, few wholly compatible with the Lincoln of sainted memory. </p>
<p>
To Catherine Clinton, author of a new biography of Lincoln’s wife, Mary, (<i>Mrs. Lincoln</i>, HarperCollins), this evolution is inevitable, given the interest in his life.  “How can we not learn new things about Lincoln?"" she asks.  “We’re all going to find new Lincolns.""</p>
<p>
Although for years Lincoln and George Washington ran neck and neck when historians ranked the greatest presidents, lately Lincoln seems to be pulling ahead; he was No. 1 in a London <i>Times</i> survey in 2008.  A <i>USA Today</i>/Gallup Poll taken February 7 and 8 ranked only Ronald Reagan and John Kennedy ahead of Lincoln among presidents Americans consider the greatest. </p>
<p>
On Presidents Day 2009, C-SPAN released the results of its second Historians Survey of Presidential Leadership, for which a cross-selection of 65 presidential historians ranked the 43 former occupants of the White House on ten attributes of leadership.  As in C-SPAN’s first such survey, released in 2000, Abraham Lincoln received top ranking from the historians.  George Washington placed second, while spots three through five were held by Franklin D. Roosevelt, Theodore Roosevelt, and Harry Truman.</p>
<p>
“We’re back where we started:  He is a great man,"" says Lewis E. Lehrman, a former Republican candidate for governor of New York and author of a new book on Lincoln’s anti-slavery speech of 1854 (<i>Lincoln at Peoria</i>, Stackpole Books). </p>
<p>
This new Lincoln seems to be more nuanced and complex than the one to whom The Lincoln Memorial was dedicated in 1922 and whom Americans have encountered in school, on television, and at the movies.</p>
<p>
Lincoln, he of the scraggly beard, skinny build, wrinkled brow and rhetorical radiance, has surely also inspired more artists than any other American president.  He has been immortalized in every medium, from copper to cardboard.  He shows up in song lyrics (“With the thoughts I’d be thinkin’, I could be another Lincoln, if I only had a brain,"" warbles the film “The Wizard of Oz"").  He’s the subject of powerful novels and incisive biographies.  In the 1994 <i>Lincoln in American Memory</i> (Oxford), Merrill D. Peterson traced the way Lincoln’s image – that craggy profile with its tousled hair and heavy brow – has graced everything from car dealerships to mattress ads.  And much has found its way into the culture in the fifteen years since. </p>
<p>
Abraham Lincoln is almost as hot as Barack Obama.  With an exhibition at the Smithsonian celebrating the 200th year of his birth, the American president was the subject of three new television documentaries. </p>
<p>
The story of John Wilkes Booth’s assassination of Lincoln and his subsequent attempted escape was told on February 9, in vivid detail in a new episode of <i>American Experience: The Assassination of Abraham Lincoln</i>.  Narrated by Oscar-winning actor Chris Cooper, the 90-minute documentary traces how Confederate sympathizer Booth was so angered by Lincoln’s reelection in 1864 that he first plotted to have the President kidnapped at Ford’s Theatre.  When that plot fizzled, he came up with the plan that he thought would make him a hero to Confederates who felt demoralized when Lincoln ended slavery. </p>
<p>
The documentary movingly reports on the Lincoln deathwatch in a house across the street from Ford’s Theatre and his 12-day journey home from Washington, to Illinois, where he was buried.  It was the reverse of the train trip he took when he was first elected.  Even as Andrew Johnson was sworn in as Lincoln’s successor, many blacks feared that the Emancipation Proclamation would be revoked and that their freedom would end.  </p>
<p>
In <i>Looking for Lincoln</i>, on PBS, February 11, Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr. addressed many of the controversies surrounding Abraham Lincoln – race, religion, politics, and depression – interpreting evidence from those who knew him and scholars who study him today. </p>
<p>
The History Channel took a different approach to the Lincoln legacy in <i>Stealing Lincoln’s Body</i> on February 16.  In 1876, 11 years after Lincoln’s assassination, a band of Chicago counterfeiters plotted to steal Lincoln’s body and hold it for ransom.  Their plan was to demand $200,000 and the release of the gang’s master engraver, who was in prison in Illinois. </p>
<p>
The Secret Service infiltrated the gang with an informer.  It also set in motion a cringe-inducing chain of events in which a group of self-appointed guardians took it upon themselves to protect Lincoln’s remains by any means necessary.  This strange story of Lincoln at unrest reveals how important this man was to so many, and our reluctance, too, to let such a beloved and visionary leader go. </p>
<p>
On the eve of his greatest address, Lincoln was the guest of David Wills, a wealthy 32-year-old lawyer who bore the burden of coordinating the town’s recovery from the three-day Battle of Gettysburg and spearheaded the Soldiers’ National Cemetery.  The house where Wills lived from 1859 until his death in 1894 is now the latest addition to Gettysburg National Military Park in partnership with Main Street Gettysbu"		Spring 2009	2009-05-01	Classics								"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=200 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/Williamspic.jpg"">"						
4898			CIVIL WAR TREASURES: <br>With the Navy in the Western Gulf: The John R. Hamilton Papers		Taylor, Michael			"<p>
On April 19, 1861, one week into the Civil War, President Lincoln announced his plan to blockade all southern ports from Virginia to Texas. The blockade’s purpose was twofold. Southern products, particularly cotton and sugar, would be kept in and, by the same token, foreign manufactured goods would be kept out. A ruined economy, Lincoln and his advisers believed, would bring the South to its knees and the war to a speedy end.</p>  
<p>
Illicit trade, of course, continued. A collection of papers recently acquired by the LSU Libraries’ Special Collections sheds new light on this trade. Dating from 1863 to 1865 and consisting chiefly of drafts of letters and official reports, the John R. Hamilton Papers document U.S. Navy operations in the Mississippi Sound, Lake Pontchartrain, and other waterways along the Gulf Coast near New Orleans, an area rife with smugglers, blockade runners, and Confederate guerrillas. The papers also contain information on escaped slaves (“contrabands""), refugees, and miscellaneous affairs of the West Gulf Blockading Squadron. Several reports give details on Union operations at Ship Island, Mississippi, the staging ground for the Federal advance on New Orleans in the spring of 1862. These reports include information on the USS <i>Vincennes</i>, an 18-gun sloop-of-war stationed at Ship Island to prevent its recapture by Confederates. (The <i>Vincennes</i>, the first American warship to circumnavigate the globe, is perhaps best known in history as the flagship of the Wilkes Expedition to Antarctica in 1838-42.)</p>
<p>
A typical incident that the Hamilton papers record occurred in January 1864.  Hamilton, a Pennsylvania native and commander of the USS <i>Commodore</i> and later the USS <i>Fort Gaines</i>, was escorting the steamer <i>Kate Dale</i> up the Tchefuncte River, a tributary of Lake Pontchartrain, to pick up a load of lumber and transport it across the lake to Union-occupied New Orleans. This part of Louisiana, known as the Northshore, was still Confederate territory and would remain so until the war’s end. To ensure the <i>Kate Dale</i> could safely pick up its cargo, Hamilton sent ahead a party of sharpshooters from the 12th Maine, who reported seeing twelve to fifteen guerrillas in the area. Hamilton’s men then spent several days guarding a sawmill; while doing so, they picked up a number of refugees, including women and children, from Mobile, as well as seven contrabands. A detailed list of former slaves serving under Hamilton is available in the collection.</p>  
<p>
U.S. Navy vessels performed similar escorts on the Amite, Blind, Tickfaw, Tangipahoa, and Pascagoula Rivers, occasionally surprising small bands of Confederates. On one mission, for example, a crew lobbed “a shell from our 20-pound rifle at a squad of rebel cavalry who immediately fled into the woods and out of sight."" Sometimes it must have seemed as if they were playing a game of cat and mouse with the enemy, the Confederates staying one step ahead, leaving still-warm campfires, burned houses, and a trail of terror in their wake. Especially vulnerable were planters and others who had taken the oath of loyalty to the Union, perhaps to be able to trade legally with New Orleans. Such men were seen as turncoats. “I was informed,"" Hamilton noted in one report, “that [the rebels] had shot a man named Watkins, who had lately taken the oath to the federal government, and taken one man prisoner.""</p> 
<p>
The Hamilton collection also documents efforts to destroy factories and other sources of Confederate military supplies, as in the case of a tannery at Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. Owned by a Frenchman named Pierre Sirvant, it was burned by Hamilton of the USS <i>Commodore</i> and Francis H. Grove of the USS <i>Corypheus</i> in October 1863.</p> 
<p>
Not all of the actions reported in the Hamilton papers were against Confederates. One report, for example, gives details of the capture of a deserter from the U.S. 2nd Louisiana Regiment Infantry, John McCaul, who with three others had been committing robberies in St. Tammany Parish.</p>
<p>
Other items of interest include printed letters intended to be read on deck of all vessels in the West Gulf Blockading Squadron. A letter from Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles offers his congratulations on the capture of Mobile, while two letters from Rear Admiral David G. Farragut reveal the severity of Navy discipline during the Civil War. One of the Farragut letters relates to the court martial of Dennis J. Maguire of the USS <i>Richmond</i>, sentenced to one year’s hard labor for leaving his post before being regularly relieved. The other is on the trial of William H. Miller, engineer of the ironclad <i>Manhattan</i>, for insubordination and use of disrespectful language.</p>
<p>
 “Most of the Civil War collections we have or that are offered to us relate to soldiers or the operations of the U.S. or Confederate armies, so I was excited to be able to acquire this group because it details naval operations, which are less well-documented in our holdings,"" said Interim Head of Special Collections Tara Z. Laver.  “These on-the-ground (or on-the-water, as the case may be) reports of blockade and guerilla activity illustrate the uncertain and dangerous conditions that existed in the space between occupied New Orleans and the still-Confederate Northshore.""</p>"		Summer 2011	2011-08-01	Classics								"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=200 height=178 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/TaylorColumn.jpg"">"						
4968			"CIVIL WAR TREASURES: <br>“What a Price to Pay, for What?"": Four Civil War Letters of Sarah Ker Butler"		Taylor, Michael			"<p>
The letter that Sarah Ker Butler (1823-1868) wrote to her sister-in-law Margaret Butler on March 5, 1861, opened as any letter might at that time of year in the South, with a long description of her garden. Yet this was no ordinary spring, and as the letter unfolds, we learn that the sweet smell of camellias had already begun to mix with the stench of secession and fear of civil war.</p>
<p>
Mrs. Butler, at the time she wrote this letter, was living on Le Carpe Plantation, her husband Richard Butler’s estate near the small town of Houma in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana. She originally hailed from Natchez and was a member of a prominent family of Mississippi planters and educators. Her grandfather, David Ker, an Irish immigrant, was “presiding professor"" (chancellor) of the University of North Carolina when it opened in 1795. He also founded Mississippi’s first public school for girls at Natchez in 1801. Sarah’s father, Dr. John Ker, a graduate of the medical college of the University of Pennsylvania and owner of Linden Plantation near Natchez, was the chief benefactor of Mississippi’s short-lived Oakland College. Her siblings William Henry and Mary later became distinguished educators, as did her grandniece, Sarah Towles Reed, a labor activist for the New Orleans public school system.</p>
<p>
Sadly, education would prove to be one of the fatalities of the Civil War. In her letter of March 5, Sarah writes that she has had news from Natchez, but has not heard whether her brother “Willie"" has “caught the military mania.""1 Willie was a junior at Harvard, where he was a member of the rowing team and Fly Club, and “was a favorite… in all phases of College life.""2 By the summer of 1861, he had dropped out of Harvard and returned south to join a Confederate cavalry regiment. (Although Ker went on to become one of Mississippi’s leading educators, his lack of a degree prevented him from obtaining a teaching position at a university, and he was estranged from his college friends until near the end of his life.3) “It is very natural and in one sense right,"" Sarah wrote, referring to southerners’ passion to defend their way of life, “and yet I cannot reconcile it to myself to see brother arming against brother, and it amazes me to hear people say it is in a cause exactly similar to that which produced the Revolution.""</p>
<p>
Sarah echoed these thoughts less than six weeks later, on April 16, 1861, in another letter to Margaret Butler, written after learning of the bombardment of Fort Sumter. The news left her feeling anxious and morally conflicted. She had recently read a sermon by Thomas Atkinson, Episcopal Bishop of North Carolina. A moderate on the issue of slavery, Atkinson had recently preached that the United States, and especially the North, had grown too prosperous and consequently corrupt. “Great prosperity has been the ruin of many countries, and of many men in every country.""4 The South was therefore justified in cutting itself away from what many clergymen saw as a diseased body. The plantation elite, of course, has prospered as much as anyone, and Sarah Butler confided to her sister-in-law that she found it hard to have much enthusiasm for “our side"" based on Atkinson’s arguments. The country, she had written in her March 5 letter, certainly “had had prosperity so long that we needed a check""; as for the current state of affairs, however, “I think we should demand and defend our rights, but it seems awful to see brethren arraged [sic] against one another.""</p> 
<p>
Her April 16 letter also provides a first-hand account of the stir the news of Fort Sumter caused in Houma, where the Butlers attended church. On entering the town, she and her husband saw soldiers, “knapsacks on backs.... There were 70 odd volunteers to leave the crossing that evening on a special train."" She wrote that her “little village was in the greatest excitement"" and that she had never had “as great a shock of news."" The Butlers waited after church for the mail to come in so they could get the latest update on the events unfolding in Charleston. “This brought the news of the capture of Fort Sumter, and I don’t think I ever felt more thankful than to hear (the most wonderful part of all) that no lives were lost on either side. I think Major Anderson (with trained gunners) must have tried not to hurt anyone.""</p> 
<p>
Sarah’s thoughts returned briefly to her garden in a letter of June 7, 1861. “What are we to do about getting plants now?"" she mused. “Tho’ I wish that was the worst of it all."" She had recently received a letter from Natchez, listing people who were going off to the war. A Mr. Martin (probably William T. Martin) had raised a cavalry troop, which Sarah’s own brother Willie would soon join. Martin had had saddles shipped from St. Louis packed in barrels and surrounded with tobacco “so that they should not be stopped."" Butler also reported that a lack of funds had prevented one group of men from forming a cavalry company, so they formed an infantry company instead. “The aggressiveness of the north has done more to reconcile me to things than anything else,"" she admitted, but feared that the national divide would soon extend to her beloved Episcopal church. “[W]hat a price to pay, for what?""</p> 
<p>
“It is the rarest thing for me to have the ‘Blues,’ but I must plead guilty lately,"" Sarah wrote in March 1863. She had fled her home in Louisiana following the fall of New Orleans and was now living in Natchez. The future seemed bleak. Dr. Stephen Duncan, one of Natchez’s wealthiest planters, still clung to the idea of reunion, Sara reported; as for the war, he believed “it will end after a while, but not as we think… we will be starved into submission."" The siege of Vicksburg was still two months away, but Federal troops were busily trying to secure the Mississippi River above Baton Rouge and take control of the mouth of the Red River. Sarah mentions the ironclad USS <i>Indianola</i>, which had managed to slip past Vicksburg and blockade the Red River, only to be captured on February 24, 1863, by the CSS <i>Webb</i> and the recently captured USS <i>Queen of the West</i>. Despite such heartening news, the general feeling was one of apprehension. “We are feeling extremely anxious about Port Hudson of course, especially since 2 vessels have passed the works, and I fear we shall not have the good fortune to sink them, much less to capture and use them, as we did the Queen of the West."" She then reports that Federals at Grosse Tete, Louisiana, had sent back handcuffed contrabands (escaped slaves) who had come to them. “I think it likely they are tired of the Elephant,"" she commented. Sarah’s father, Dr. John Ker, had been a vice-president of the American Colonization Society, so exasperation over the issue of slavery was no stranger to the family.</p>

5435			CIVIL WAR TREASURES: <br>Battle of the Books: Fates of the Printed Page in the Civil War		Taylor, Michael			"<p>
The most horrific aspect of the Civil War was, of course, the 600,000 deaths that resulted from it. Many other terrible things, however, befell the nation during those years, not least of which was the destruction of books and libraries.</p> 
<p>
Several copies of what is now one of the most valuable books in the world—the spectacular elephant folio edition of John James Audubon’s <i>Birds of America</i>—were destroyed during the war. The copy that belonged to the Hugger family of Limerick House near Charleston, South Carolina, fell victim to Union troops under General E. E. Potter. After the men had finished ransacking the house, they sat down to dinner, but rather than eating it off of Mrs. Hugger’s china, they wrapped it in pages torn from Audubon’s masterpiece. Another copy of the work was owned by Eli Geddings, a Charleston physician. Fearing the city would be destroyed, he sent his library to Columbia, the state capital, where, despite his precaution, it went up in flames along with the rest of the city in February 1865 during General Sherman’s occupation. A third copy is believed to have perished under unknown circumstances somewhere in Charleston before the war ended <sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>
It is doubtful whether Sherman ever learned of these sad events. If he had, he would have been appalled. The general was, after all, an intelligent, literate man who, up until just a few months before the war’s outbreak, had been the superintendent of the Louisiana State Seminary of Learning and Military Academy, the forerunner of Louisiana State University. In 1859, shortly before the school opened, Sherman moved from his native Ohio to the little town of Pineville deep in the central Louisiana woods and began acquiring books for the use of his nineteen students and five professors. When summer came, he escaped the stifling heat by going to New York, where he purchased approximately 400 additional volumes from bookseller David Van Nostrand. The books range from Friedrich Schiller’s reflections on the Thirty Years’ War to William Hickling Prescott’s histories of Latin America; from Alexander von Humboldt’s <i>Cosmos</i> to the poetry of John Milton. He even took care of mundane things like dictionaries and encyclopedias and left directions about how the volumes should be bound <sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>
Although Sherman promptly tendered his resignation from the seminary when Louisiana tendered its own resignation from the Union in January 1861, he never gave up on the school. During the Red River Campaign, he gave orders to General Nathaniel Banks that the campus be spared. Nonetheless, its buildings had little if anything left in them by the end of the war, having been used by troops on both sides of the conflict. Sherman did what he could to help recover as many books as could be found, and duplicates were transferred from the State Library.</p> 
<p>
Just as the collection was being put back together, however, tragedy struck. On October 15, 1869, a fire destroyed the Seminary, including the 7,000-volume library. Sherman came to the rescue again, sending books from his own library and whatever else he could scrape together in Washington. “I have a bag of books, sent me from the Congress, which I have not even opened, and I have ordered it sent to you,"" he wrote in May 1873 to David F. Boyd, his successor as superintendent. “If of little value, they will help to fill your shelves"" <sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p>
Not all was doom and gloom when it came to books during the Civil War. Although the war put a stop to the flow of textbooks from the North, Southerners did what they could to fill the need. In Louisiana, despite severe paper shortages, Governor Henry W. Allen ordered the printing of the <i>Louisiana English Grammar</i> on paper that may have been smuggled in from Mexico. His secretary, Edmund Halsey, edited the work. In Mount Lebanon, Professor William W. Womack used Noah Webster’s <i>Elementary Spelling Book</i> as the model for his <i>Confederate Speller</i>. It was intended to be the first in a series of books “by which it is proposed to supplant an unwholesome supply from alien and inimical sources"" <sup>4</sup>.</p>

5802			CIVIL WAR SESQUICENTENNIAL: <br>The Political Crisis of the 1850s and the Irrepressible Historians		Childers, Christopher			"<p>
The political crisis of the Union—the means by which unity and comity disintegrated and the American people descended into war with themselves—has fascinated and perplexed students of the Civil War era since the battlefields became silent. The seminal question “What caused the Civil War?"" naturally leads students of the Civil War era to the political crises of the 1850s. And, in turn, historians have sought over the 150 years since the war to find ways to explain how the war came. In many respects, the historiographical battle over the politics of slavery and the coming of the war has hinged on a major theme. Just as Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas sparred over the moral implications of slavery and the sectional crisis, so too have historians fought over how morality fits into the broader narrative of antebellum politics and the coming of the Civil War.</p>
<p>  

Scholars have long debated whether the Civil War constituted an “irrepressible conflict"" or a “repressible conflict"" between North and South.  Though North and South increasingly diverged in the 19th century, largely as a result of the decline of slavery in the North and its perpetuation and expansion in the South, describing the Civil War as an irrepressible conflict suggests the inevitability of conflict.  Many historians have shown that the Civil War did not become inevitable at some point earlier than 1861; indeed, options for sectional rapprochement existed almost up to that very point.  Nevertheless, scholars have found unmistakable evidence of significant differences that complicate the story of the antebellum political crisis.</p>
<p>
Northerners and Southerners lived within different societies by virtue of slavery.  Slavery evolved into more than a system of labor in the South; indeed, by the antebellum era, it had become a major component of the social, cultural, and political life of the region and its inhabitants.  The same set of circumstances simply did not exist in the North, as slavery disappeared in the region over the course of the early republic and early antebellum eras.  Yet at the same time, the two sections shared much in common: a shared national government, a basic shared set of cultural values and norms (excluding slavery), and modes of commerce and communication, among others.  The sameness of experience seemed to hold the sections together even as slavery served as a divisive issue in the nation. </p>
<p>
Understanding how students of the Civil War era have grappled with these ideas and sought to explain them in a coherent narrative explain how we understand the coming of the war today. The irrepressible conflict argument originated before the war with the famous pronouncements of men like William Seward and Abraham Lincoln and reemerged with the work of historian James Ford Rhodes in his seven-volume work <i>The History of the United States from the Compromise of 1850</i> (1893-1906). To Rhodes and his students, slavery alone caused the breakdown of American politics in the 1850s and led to the Civil War. Rhodes emphasized the moral aspects of the slavery question as well as the institution’s social and cultural impact on the divergence of North and South by the 1850s. To Rhodes and a generation of scholars trained in his work, the inevitability of the Civil War seemed remarkably apparent.</p>
<p>
By the late 1920s, however, a new generation of scholars began to challenge the self-evident inevitability of the war and the primacy of slavery as its cause. Inspired in part by Charles and Mary Beard’s economic determinism, which emphasized slavery as an economic institution and a source of labor, and by a general post-World War I disillusionment with war, politics, and ideology, a group of historians—who would become known as the revisionists—challenged the theme of an irrepressible conflict. For a generation, the revisionist historians argued that the Civil War was a repressible conflict. A paucity of pragmatic leadership had led to a crisis of governance; compromise failed as abolitionists and proslavery fanatics (and the revisionists appropriated most of their blame to the former) divided the political system and the nation over the issue of slavery. The revisionists tended to dismiss the moral strictures of the abolitionists as fanaticism, while lauding those willing to compromise on the slavery question as pragmatists. </p>
<p>
The revisionists, most notably represented by James G. Randall and Avery Craven, responded to the moral condemnation of slavery by arguing instead that a blundering generation of leaders had failed to achieve sectional harmony, thereby leading the nation into a civil war that could have been avoided if northerners had acted more diplomatically. The revisionists seemed incredulous that the politicians of the 1850s were so shortsighted as to brook disunion over what, for the revisionists themselves, seemed like issues ripe for compromise. They sought to explain the superheated rhetoric of the 1850s in psychological terms by blaming the disintegration of politics and compromise on a small group of fanatics who frenzied politicians and citizens in Washington and across the nation. </p>
<p>
By the 1950s and 1960s, the revisionist school had collapsed amidst the resurgence of the civil rights movement and America’s grappling with race as a paramount political issue. A new generation of historians sought to reaffirm the primacy of slavery and its moral implications for American society and politics by refuting the revisionists’ claims that slavery really had not caused the war in the first place. In some respects, students of the Civil War era returned to a moral interpretation akin to Rhodes. That said, throughout the 1960s and 1970s, scholars looked for new ways to explain the erosion of the American political system and the coming of the Civil War. Some saw the fall of the Whig Party, the disintegration of the Democrats, and the creation of the Republican Party as a watershed moment of instability at a time in which Americans desperately needed stability. But whereas some historians identified slavery as the cause of the collapse, others looked to “ethnocultural"" factors such as immigration, nativism, and other cultural differences in an increasingly growing and diverse nation. </p>
<p>
Today, historians frequently borrow from these schools to explain the political crisis of the 1850s. The contours of modern interpretations of the coming of the Civil War fall within a general narrative from which historians branch out into new fields of inquiry. The North and South had bitter and profound differences by the 1850s that increasingly tested the stability and permanence of the political system. The South remained wedded to its peculiar institution, while northerners increasingly saw slavery as a moral and social evil. Both sections sought to use the political arena as a means to protect—and perpetuate—their respective agendas. Northerners increasingly saw slavery as a threat to northern free labor, especially in the emerging West, and sought to circumscribe the limits of slavery’s expansion through a variety of means, most notably through the use of popular sovereignty. The popular sovereignty doctrine promised to let the people of the territories themselves decide whether to permit or prohibit slavery, thereby removing the issue from congressional purview via a democratic solution. Alas, popular sovereignty as expressed in the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 nearly destroyed the Democratic Party and gave rise to a new political organization dedicated to free soil, free labor, and free men: the Republican Party.</p>
<p>
The formation of the Republican Party, coupled with a relentless demographic shift that saw much larger population growth in the North rather than the South led to a political crisis for southerners. The South had long held more than its share of power in the federal government by virtue of the three-fifths compromise, which essentially made the Senate a bulwark of southern protection.  By mid-century, however, the South had become less powerful as more free states entered the Union.  The conflict over slavery in the territories, and indeed the conflict over union, largely rested on the future of sectional power in the halls of government. A small but vocal group of southern nationalists, as early as the late 1840s and early 1850s, began calculating the value of the Union to southern interests. </p>
<p>
Beyond the differences that slavery had engendered, however, a majority of northerners and southerners remained resolute in preserving the Union and believed that the political system could achieve results. After all, for several generations the great compromisers of Congress had smoothed over sectional crises one by one. Both sides blustered mightily, but in the end they brokered a compromise. In 1820, 1833, and 1850, for example, both sections overcame threats of disunion and compromised on the point of slavery. The Compromise of 1850, however, foreshadowed the increasing difficulty of compromising in a nation becoming more rigidly for and against slavery. The historian David M. Potter argued compellingly that the 1850 accord represented an “armistice"" rather than a compromise, since neither side had to agree to provisions that they found unacceptable in order to seal the compromise. Instead, the compromise deferred to a later date the need to answer definitively some basic questions concerning the Union. For many, that date came four years later with the incredibly contentious (and narrow) passage of Illinois senator Stephen A. Douglas’s Kansas-Nebraska Act in Congress. President Franklin Pierce had made support of the bill an article of faith for Democrats. The intransigence of Pierce and Douglas, coupled with the demands of southerners to repeal the Missouri Compromise line as part of the bill, led to a major split within the party itself, as disaffected “Independent Democrats"" sought refuge in the nascent Republican Party. Parties and politics shifted dramatically amidst this political earthquake.</p>
<p>
The fragility of compromise and the increasingly shrill rhetoric from ultra proslavery and antislavery forces, however, must not obscure the fact that sufficient resolve existed among northerners and southerners to preserve the Union.  Compromise did not hide the differences between North and South, but the commonality of national experience and union prevailed. For a time, the nation even weathered Bleeding Kansas, Bleeding Sumner, and <i>Dred Scott v. Sandford</i>. By 1860, however, things had changed in ways ominous for the cause of union. The debacle of Kansas and John Brown’s raid on Harpers Ferry had inflamed and scared southerners, while northerners resolutely rejected slavery and the “Slave Power.""  Abraham Lincoln won election to the presidency without a single southern electoral vote.  The election of 1860 marked a shattering blow to the South and its political power. Many southerners feared that Lincoln’s election jeopardized the South’s influence within the Union, and consequently, they possessed no means to protect what they perceived as their rights.  </p>
<p>
By the secession winter of 1860-1861, many southerners stood ready to leave the Union, but many others wanted to wait and see what came of the Lincoln presidency.  The presence of a significant group of conditional unionists in southern states amid increasingly louder calls for secession showed that war had not become inevitable or that conflict was irrepressible. Many northerners and southerners genuinely hoped once again for sectional rapprochement and believed that political solutions remained possible. The war came in 1861 as compromise failed and a standoff over possession of federal property came to conflict on April 12, 1861. The election of Lincoln had led seven southern state secession conventions to declare the bonds of Union dissolved. But even here, the stark divisions of sectional politics remained. Four southern states waited until Lincoln’s call for troops after the shelling of Fort Sumter. Clearly, the politics of union—and indeed disunion—remained intricate and complicated even past the point at which the first shots of the Civil War were fired.</p>

5360			"CIVIL WAR TREASURES: <br>“I Hope You Will Learn to be a True Patriot"": A Southern Planter’s Letters to His Son at Harvard"		Taylor, Michael			"<p>
When John Walworth dropped off his seventeen-year-old son Douglas at Harvard College shortly before the beginning of fall term 1850, the students and faculty there had just endured one of the most scandalous events in the school’s history. John White Webster, a professor of chemistry and geology, had recently been convicted of the gruesome murder of fellow professor George Parkman, a member of one of Boston’s wealthiest families. To try to cover up the crime, Webster had dismembered the body and thrown parts of it into the furnace and toilet in his private laboratory. Parkman’s torso, too big to burn, was found locked in a chest, half of a charred leg shoved up inside of it. A horrified judge and jury wasted no time in sentencing Webster to death. </p>
<p>

John Walworth was on his way home to Natchez, Mississippi, when he heard news that Dr. Webster had gone to the gallows<sup>1</sup>. As terrible as the professor’s actions were, however, they must have seemed like only the most extreme example of how the nation was becoming more and more uncivil—North pitted against South, white against black. Although that year saw the Compromise of 1850, the national rift continued to widen, and little more than a decade would pass before the whole country became embroiled in a four-year killing spree arguably no less heinous than the Webster-Parkman murder case. Even after the slaughter came to an end, another madman, John Wilkes Booth, would choose to settle his grievances with a pistol rather than civilized debate. Perhaps sensing this alarming trend toward violence, Walworth emphasized in one of his first letters to his son after leaving him at Harvard—a letter now part of the LSU Libraries Special Collections—that he should “study ease of manners and a kind and conciliatory deportment as well as your books"" <sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>

Admittedly, it was a challenging time for southerners like the Walworths to be civil to their Northern neighbors. Abolitionists, after all, were jeopardizing their very livelihood. A New Yorker by birth, John Walworth had joined the ranks of prosperous Mississippi planters, owning, by the 1850s, about 200 slaves and two plantations totaling more than 3,000 acres, plus some 1,400 acres of “wild land"" in Arkansas <sup>3</sup>. Although he disliked abolitionists, he felt strongly that he owed his prosperity to the Union and scoffed at the idea of secession, which, to his dismay, his son Douglas was in favor of. Harvard, in fact, was part of his plan to teach Douglas something about patriotism. If the boy got nothing more out of his time there than a lesson in good citizenship and getting along with other people, his father believed, he would be the better for it.</p>
<p>

“Disunion ought not to be thought of,"" Douglas was advised in another letter. The South had gained much in the Compromise of 1850, which included the passing of the Fugitive Slave Act. Daniel Webster, “the first man of all New England,"" was “still doing all in his power to allay sectional differences, and when we have all the great and good on our side, we may look with contempt and listen in silence to such petty politicians as raise these little neighborhood meetings. Therefore never allow yourself to get warm or in the least excited on this subject. I would not talk on it, but refer such (as wish to make themselves conspicuous by broaching it) to the Constitution of the United States and say, that is all we ask, and if they violate it, they are covenant breakers; and with such you wish to have nothing to do"" <sup>4</sup>.</p>
<p>

Covenant breakers on the other side of the aisle, however, were just as bad, in Walworth’s opinion, and the legislature back at home in Mississippi was rife with them. Led by the state’s fire-eating governor and fellow New York transplant John Quitman, the “ultras,"" Walworth believed, shared the blame with “rabid fanatical abolitionists"" for the worsening sectional crisis. “This clique is equally contemptible in numbers and not much better generally in character"" <sup>5</sup>. Walworth was also suspicious of filibustering schemes—attempts to take over Latin American countries and create a Southern, slaveholding empire—and he discouraged his son from getting involved in them. When, in 1851, Narciso López’s failed invasion of Cuba ended in the execution, by the Spanish, of his Southern cohorts, Walworth showed little sympathy, calling the men “deluded"" and the whole affair a “wild quixotic expedition"" <sup>6</sup>.</p>
<p>

“I hope you will learn to be a true patriot, to ‘know no South, no North, but my country and my whole country,’"" Walworth wrote to his son on yet another occasion, quoting the Great Compromiser, Henry Clay <sup>7</sup>. He believed Northerners ought to follow the same advice. While part of his reason for sending Douglas to New England for an education was to form “acquaintances and friendships at school which will be lasting"" and to learn to respect different points of view, few Northerners, he found, were returning the gesture. “[T]he Northern youth knows nothing of the South and her institutions, nor of her wants"" <sup>8</sup>.</p>
<p>

In the end, of course, Walworth’s best hopes for further compromise came to nothing. Douglas’s education, too, did not turn out as expected. Despite having shown promise as a student, the young man was more interested in girls, clothes, the theater, and trips to New York and Philadelphia. A combination of ill health and homesickness compelled him to drop out of Harvard after his first year. He transferred to Princeton, but felt even less at home there and soon returned to Natchez. By the time he signed his name to the roll of a Confederate infantry regiment, his father’s good advice to him as a teenager must have seemed a thing of the past. “When the people of the North and South know each other and their duties to each other better,"" his father had written a decade before, “we shall have more quiet times and better feelings"" <sup>9</sup>. We are left to wonder whether Douglas, during his years at war, ever reflected on the wisdom of those words, now that he was encountering his former schoolmates once again, not in the classroom, but on the battlefield.</p>

5205			CIVIL WAR TREASURES: <br>The Needle and Thimble Brigade: Women in Civil War Baton Rouge		Taylor, Michael			"<p>“One thing is my heart’s desire now, and that is, to be a man,"" an anonymous writer, who signed herself only as “Anxiety,"" confided to the editor of the Baton Rouge <i>Gazette and Comet</i> in February 1862. “[A]nd would I were one, I would have left ‘footprints’ in the blood of the Yankees long ago.""

In this issue’s “treasures"" column, we look at a number of items from the LSU Libraries’ Special Collections that shed light on women’s involvement in the struggle between North and South as it played out in Louisiana’s capital city.</p>
<p>
A few months after the war began, the editor of the Baton Rouge <i>Weekly Advocate</i> reported that a group of women, whom he dubbed “The Needle and Thimble Brigade,"" had begun meeting across the street from the paper’s offices to make clothes for Confederate soldiers. “From morning till late evening,"" he observed, “do our noble matrons and maidens ply the needle."" <sup>2</sup> </p>
<p>
When the Union Navy sailed up the Mississippi in the spring of 1862 intent on snatching Baton Rouge from the Confederate fold, a woman was unknowingly responsible for a minor but deadly fracas that heightened concerns about women’s safety. On May 28, three weeks after Federal forces took control of the capital, five of Commodore David F. Farragut’s men set off for the riverbank in a small unarmed boat in search of a woman to do their laundry. A band of guerrillas had somehow made it into the town and fired on the sailors as they neared the shore. Two U.S. gunboats returned fire, destroying several waterfront shanties and accidentally killing three women. In his diary, the Baton Rouge planter John C. Elder recorded that he had seen women running for safety as the attack got underway. He gave his buggy to two of them, one coddling a newborn baby in her arms, to help them escape. <sup>3</sup></p>
<p>
Many feared that worse was to come. Leon Bonnecaze, the Vice-Consul of France in Baton Rouge, wrote to Farragut immediately after the incident urging him not to hold the townspeople responsible for the actions of guerrillas and risk innocent lives “by skirmishing with your forces within the corporate limits."" The commodore replied that he could make no guarantees, but that “if time and opportunity is given, you shall have due notice for the removal of the women and children."" <sup>4</sup> </p>
<p>
And yet when the battle of Baton Rouge commenced at daybreak on August 5, 1862, civilians were once again taken by surprise. Eliza McHatton-Ripley, the mistress of nearby Arlington Plantation, witnessed hundreds of women pouring out of the town, having been roused from their beds by gunfire, some “hatless, bonnetless, some with slippers and no stockings, some with wrappers hastily thrown over nightgowns."" She spotted a “distracted mother [carrying] an older child with wounded and bleeding feet,"" and “occasionally could be descried a battered umbrella held over some delicate woman to temper the rays of what was fast becoming a blazing August sun."" Eliza had helped organize the “Campaign Sewing Society"" a year earlier when hostilities began. “Its very title shows how transient we regarded the emergency; how little we deemed the campaign would develop into a four years’ war!""<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>
John Morgan, a native of Clinton, Louisiana, who was wounded and captured at the battle of Baton Rouge, left us a letter in which he tells about the role women played as nurses in the weeks following the Confederate defeat. “The ladies who are left here are very devoted to the wounded soldiers,"" Morgan wrote to his sister. “There is some half dozen or dozen young ladies who have been here almost all of the time, day and night, ever since we were wounded. I never saw persons take more interest in anyone than they have taken in the wounded soldiers here."" As has so often occurred, he took an interest in them in return. “I have fallen in love with Baton Rouge, or someone here, I do not know which, but am inclined to think that I will try and find out which when the war is over. I have made the acquaintance of some of the loveliest young ladies here that I have ever seen in my life."" <sup>6</sup></p>
<p>
It was a lady, in fact, who helped Morgan deliver his letter to his sister in what was still enemy territory. For the woman to do such a thing would have required a pass, and a pass required an affirmation of loyalty. Women routinely acquired passes from Federal authorities. One pass, shown here, was granted to Leocadie Lauzin of Baton Rouge. It allowed her to purchase pork, lard, coffee, flour, calico, and shoes in the city and carry them over the picket lines; in exchange, she was required to take an oath of allegiance and swear that she would give no “aid, comfort or information"" to enemies of the United States and would use the goods “for the exclusive use of myself and my family or plantation.""<sup>7</sup> </p>

5283			"CIVIL WAR TREASURES: <br>“Plenty of Vexations in a Surgeon’s Life"": A Civil War Doctor’s Battle for Respect"		Taylor, Michael			"<p>“The avocation of a physician is one which of all others, imperatively demands the exercise of independence of thought,"" Dr. John Eastman Sanborn advised his students at the University of Iowa medical college in 1855. “True, you will find it easier in a shortsighted and mechanical point of view, to have others think for you than to think yourselves; to believe, than to know. But… your mission on this round globe is one of vital principles, not a dull search for mere enjoyment""<sup>1</sup>. In our “treasures"" column this month, we examine the life of this pioneer doctor, who, during the Civil War, strove to live up to those words. Though he saw little action, his experiences, candidly related in letters to his wife that are now part of the LSU Libraries’ Special Collections, reveal that members of the army medical corps often had more to worry about than battle wounds. For some, conflict with officers and other medical men over how much authority an army doctor should have and how much respect was due to a chief surgeon could be at least as great a source of anxiety and frustration.</p>
<p>
Sanborn, a Harvard graduate, joined the tide of settlers moving west to the new state of Iowa in the early 1850s. Ill health compelled him to resign his post at the state medical college in Keokuk, but by 1857, he was practicing medicine in the small prairie town of Epworth. On October 3, 1862, he was mustered in as staff surgeon of the 27th Iowa Volunteer Infantry at Camp Franklin in nearby Dubuque. Almost immediately, Sanborn was astonished at how lightly officers took the health of their men. The 27th Iowa’s first destination was Fort Snelling, Minnesota, where they were to help Major General John Pope put an end to the Sioux Uprising before it spilled onto the Iowa frontier. The fighting ended just as Sanborn arrived, allaying the doctor’s fears of what a winter at Fort Snelling (“said to be the very bleakest and coldest place in all the north"") would do to his men’s health<sup>2</sup>. They were not, however, out of the woods. In the first week of November, the regiment received orders to depart for Mississippi to join Sherman and Grant in their pursuit of General Sterling Price. Sanborn was annoyed at how they departed from St. Paul. The men were marched from the fort to the steamboat landing a full day before the boats’ departure and left to sleep under the stars, without rations, on the cold rocky shore. “Plenty of vexations in a surgeon’s life,"" Sanborn complained<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p>
The situation was little better after they embarked. The rations were still poor, the boat crews charged a high price for food, and Sanborn struggled to provide comfort to his sick men. “[T]he best of my efforts avail not to give them what I would call for myself ordinary conveniences… A private, on these rascally boats, gets about the treatment of a dog. They sleep on the deck, or barges, or among the machinery and on the freight… get the use of the washroom only by sufferance, and are abused generally."" Sanborn had “separate and individual jaws"" with boat officers, to no avail<sup>4</sup>.</p>
 <p>
The doctor also “jawed"" with his own staff. Although he and assistant surgeon Albert Boomer were on good terms, his other assistant surgeon, David C. Hastings, and hospital steward Hiram H. Hunt were thorns in his side. He described them both dismissively as Thomsonian eclectics—believers in herbal remedies and the ability of the common man to cure himself. Hastings had “used a good deal of unkind and ungenerous influence"" against Sanborn and Boomer; meanwhile, Hunt, “hoping to profit in promotion by securing my or Boomer leaving, is slyly using civilian influences against us"" <sup>5</sup>. Hunt had operated his own medical practice for nearly ten years before the war, resented having to serve in a subordinate position, and was frustrated by the fact that the 27th “always got the fag end of everything"" <sup>6</sup>. After one squabble, Sanborn considered resigning, but he eventually triumphed in his views. Although he omitted details of the case when telling his wife about it, “My medical friends and superior medical officers support me, and sustain my course. Dr. Hunt is soon to go, and I have ready to put in his place a man of character and integrity, who will carry out my wishes and obey my instructions, and not busy himself to backbite and undermine me"" <sup>7</sup>. In June 1863, Hunt secured a transfer to the 21st Iowa Volunteers as its assistant surgeon<sup>8</sup>.</p>
<p>
The 27th’s officers, too, could be a source of irritation. “[T]he surgeon cannot gratify all their whining or requests,"" Sanborn asserted<sup>9</sup>.  He was overjoyed when, in May 1863, his corps commander, Brigadier General Nathan Kimball, issued his General Orders No. 21, stating that hospital tents be used for hospital purposes only, ambulances be kept in good repair, and commanding officers obey the orders of the division’s medical director and their regimental surgeons regarding sanitary measures<sup>10</sup>.  Kimball had been a prominent doctor in Indiana before the war, and Sanborn was glad to have found such a powerful advocate for surgeons’ authority. “The colonel and every officer along down will learn that my medical orders must and shall be obeyed,"" he informed his wife back in Iowa. “Half of my trouble has been from a reluctance on the part of the colonel to carry out my wishes and obey my instructions. He evidently felt that HE is the high cockalorum, and when he wishes anything, no dog must bark, that I, the doctors, and the hospital and medical department were of little importance. I shall hold the reins now, myself, more vigorously than ever and shall insist on respect being paid to my position"" <sup>11</sup>.</p>
<p>
Sanborn’s crusade was not merely for one personal respect. He sincerely saw a need for action, for by the time the 27th Iowa marched into Arkansas in August 1863, it had lost more than a quarter of its men to disease and disability. This was a common experience throughout the army, but it frustrated Dr. Sanborn, who could not understand the failure to take simple precautions. For example, on Christmas Eve, 1862, while marching in Tennessee, his regiment went without tents or shelter of any kind and suffered greatly from exposure. On one excursion the following spring, Sanborn took along a rubber raincoat, cap, and pants, anticipating lack of shelter. “Think of your husband, me, lying down and sleeping in the rain, in a southern forest or an open field, sleeping on the muddy ground, or raising myself off the ground by lying on a pile of rails or a heap of brush,"" he wrote to his wife<sup>12</sup>. In fact, he attributed the spinal condition, possibly spinal meningitis, that afflicted many of his men to having lain on the cold, wet ground<sup>13</sup>.</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, Sanborn’s letters to his wife have not all survived, but we can infer from the later ones that he continued to clash with officers. Writing from the U.S. General Hospital at Keokuk in February 1865, he grumbled: “The amount of it is, that I suppose [if] a man [is] to be a popular surgeon in this regiment, [he] must drink with the officers, play cards with them, treat them to good government whiskey, and swear enough to show that he is not above such things… With our present officers, there cannot be any harmony between us. I may tolerate it awhile longer, but shall probably end it sooner or later by resigning"" <sup>14</sup>.  Luckily the war was over before his patience wore out. Sanborn eventually returned to Massachusetts, where he became a prominent physician and public health advocate. He died in 1903.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Similar in format and length, both titles are well-written contributions to the new Concise Lincoln Library series of Southern Illinois University Press edited by Richard W. Etulain, Sara Vaughn Gabbard, and Sylvia Frank Rodrigue.<sup>1</sup> </p>
<p>While, at first glance, they cover separate issues, there is a common theme that runs through both--the relationships between Abraham Lincoln and his family and associates.</p>
<p>In Kenneth Winkle’s account of the Lincolns’ marriage, the author compares them to middle-class couples of Victorian America (125-126).  Abraham and Mary Lincoln’s entire lives are covered in under 150 pages.  An incongruity characterizes their relationship.  Mary was a strong asset to her spouse’s political career, but her personal issues became a negative for him.  The author demonstrates how Mary’s grief from the assassination of her husband was equal to that of her contemporary, Queen Victoria, when she lost her beloved Albert (115).  Despite the conflicts, the author insists that Abraham and Mary were true to their wedding vows reflected in the engraving on Mary’s wedding band—“Love is eternal.”</p>
<p>With the rare exception of individuals like Eleanor Roosevelt and Jacqueline Kennedy, First Ladies have, for the most part, remained invisible to the public and to historians, relegated to the private inner sphere of domesticity within the family circle.  Mary Lincoln, a bright, well-educated and ambitious young woman, was born and reared in the first half of the nineteenth century when women were expected to be pious, pure, submissive, and confined to the home.  Beginning in early childhood, Mary failed to conform completely to these social norms.  In addition to a propensity for elaborate clothing, she thoroughly enjoyed exercising her wit, especially in the forbidden realm of politics.  Her marriage marked a determination to become an active part in Abraham Lincoln’s political career.  As a result, harsh criticism followed throughout her life, persisting even into contemporary times.  Tragedy followed as well, leaving her vulnerable to the seduction of the spiritualist movement and to the maneuverings of her elder son, Robert, who eventually committed her to an insane asylum.  History’s portrait of Mary Lincoln, unlike that of her husband Abraham, is rarely flattering.  Yet she was an intelligent and resourceful woman supporting a courageous husband.  They were unquestionably devoted, as Kenneth Winkle ably demonstrates.</p>
<p><i>Abraham Lincoln and Horace Greeley </i>depicts a fluctuating and stormy relationship of allies and foes between these two strong men, as if Lincoln’s relationship with Mary were not challenging enough.  Both Lincoln and Greeley supported Henry Clay’s American system and their “right to rise” as self-made men (Gabor Boritt, <i>Lincoln and the Economics of the American Dream i</i>).  Both were reformers who abhorred slavery.  Despite the similarities, both were sometime adversaries.  The intricate relationship played out in the pages of Greeley’s <i>New York Tribune</i>.  Borchard explains the growth of these two leaders while discussing the end of the Whig Party, formation of the new Republican Party, and the advocating of “manifest destiny” to the Pacific.  Of course, the Civil War plays a major role in the lives of both men.  Borchard’s book is insightful, offering an excellent introduction to a political relationship between Lincoln and Greeley.  It is well-researched, engaging, and should capture readers interested in the Middle Period of our history.</p>
<p>The author’s use of pointed barbs from the <i>Tribune</i>, as well as the papers of both Lincoln and Greeley, gives us useful source material, too.  Both men met during their single congressional terms and became friends.  They voted the same on bills ninety-five times.  Greeley would later recall that</p>
<blockquote>I first met Mr. Lincoln late in 1848 at Washington, as a Representative in the Thirtieth Congress, the only one to which he was ever elected.  His was, as apportioned under the census of 1840, a Whig district and he was elected from it in 1846 by the largest majority it ever gave anyone.  He was then not quite forty years old; a genial, cheerful, rather comely man, noticeably tall, and the only Whig from Illinois, not remarkable otherwise, to the best of my recollection.  He was generally liked on our side of the House; he made two or three moderate and sensible speeches which attracted little attention; he voted generally to forbid the introduction of slavery into the still untainted Territories; but he did not vote for Daniel Gott’s resolve looking to the immediate abolition of slavery in the Federal District, being deterred by the somewhat fiery preamble thereto.” (37 & Horace Greeley, <i>Recollections of a Busy Life</i> (288) . </blockquote>
<p>Both were dedicated to freedom with a lifelong record of opposing slavery (13).  </p>
<p>Yet there was also conflict between them.  For example, when in 1858 Greeley became a leader of some eastern Republicans who endorsed Senator Stephen A. Douglas for reelection in Illinois.  While his efforts were to split the Democratic Party, his actions angered Douglas’s likely Republican opponent in Illinois-Abraham Lincoln.  The way this and other intermittent conflicts were resolved such as emancipation, presidential power ,and the winning of the war, are told with great verve by the author.</p>
<p>What is evident from these two volumes is how Lincoln used his potent political skills both at home and in his public career.  They are dramatic stories about a pivotal moment in United States history.  Both authors share a gift for capturing a sense of narrative and a talent for enabling readers to see and feel history in the making.  In these pages, Lincoln appears almost larger-than-life.  Yet despite enormous ambition, he demonstrates, most of the time, considerable humility.</p>
<p>Taken together, these brief volumes on Lincoln’s life create a detailed picture of an immensely complicated and, sometimes, conflicted individual.  They also reveal a prism by which to view his time in American life and politics during which the country experienced tumultuous and divisive cultural change.</p>

5359	978-0-252-03707-8	$35.00	A LOOK AT LINCOLN: <br>Putting Mary Lincoln On Trial<br> <i>Mary Lincoln's Insanty Case: A Documentary History</i>		Emerson, Jason			"<p></p>
<p>
Was Mary Lincoln a psycho spend-thrift who made Abraham Lincoln’s life a living hell or was she a strong-willed, bereaved woman from the death of three of her four sons and the assassination of her beloved husband?  Over the past 138 years, Mary Lincoln’s “insanity” has been studied closely and written about extensively.  Her case has been examined from feminist, legal, and medical angles.  It has been scrutinized from speculations on Robert Lincoln’s motives in 1875 for having his mother legally committed as insane to the Bellevue Place Sanitarium in Batavia, IL.  Another view emerged with Jason Emerson’s recently published <i>The Madness of Mary Lincoln </i>(Southern Illinois University Press) while this volume scrupulously provides source material to enable readers to form their own opinions.</p>
<p>

From the time she was committed against her will in May 1875 until her freedom four months later on August 24, Mary lived in a single room prisonlike structure.  When she was released, the <i>Chicago Times </i>declared “Her physicians pronounce her as sane” (126).  She had been given an hour’s advance notice before her trial on May 19, 1875.  The testimony of hotel staff, shop clerks, and four doctors who had never examined her, was admitted into evidence.  A jury declared her insane and her son Robert was made her guardian, responsible for her estate—including her substantial financial assets.</p>
<p>

Or was Robert driven by darker motives?  What caused Robert to have his mother humiliated and committed?  He claimed genuine concern for her well-being, alarmed at her bizarre behavior and statements.  She had told him that someone was trying to poison her and that a spirit was removing bones from her face, while he asserted that his mother “has been irresponsible for the past ten years”  (x).  Mary claimed he was interested in her wealth and possessions as she was heir to a third of her husband’s estate while Robert’s own financial needs far exceeded his earning power.  Moreover, biographer Jean Baker believes Robert feared that his mother’s strange behavior might ruin his political career.</p>
<p>

Mary’s rescue from the Bellevue asylum was accomplished by the legal team of James and Myra Bradwell.  It’s a drama within the family drama between mother and son.  Myra’s clandestine visits to Mary at Bellevue provoked more press coverage and a second trial in which Mary was declared “restored to reason,” and fully capable of managing her own assets (183).  Mary left the United States after her release from the asylum and moved to Europe for four years.</p>
<p>

Jason Emerson is a Lincoln family specialist with excellent detective skills.  Other historians have been equally fascinated with the Lincoln family history (e.g., see <i>The Insanity File: The Case of Mary Todd Lincoln </i>edited by Mark E. Neely, Jr. and R. Gerald McMurtry about the 1875 jury trial declaring Mary Lincoln insane as well as the role of her eldest son Robert, and the author’s excellent <i>Giant in the Shadows: The Life of Robert T. Lincoln</i>, Southern Illinois University Press).</p>
<p>

After her husband’s assassination, convention dictated that Mary Lincoln should live quietly, but social norms seldom ruled her life.  Her reputation was undermined from her obsession to buy many of the same items and not use them.  After Robert filed a petition to have her declared insane and committed, he then became the star witness at her hearing.  Mary was declared insane and ordered to the sanitarium.</p>
<p>

This documentary evidence contains startling details of Mary’s story before, during and after her trial leading to her eventual release from the sanitarium, as well as the damaging effects of Robert’s breach with his mother.  Drawing on primary sources, Jason Emerson presents a detailed portrait of a woman who remained her own person.  The more than 100 letters, many newspaper articles—including editorials, and legal documents, become almost bewildering.  Emerson includes daily patient progress reports from the sanitarium where Mary Lincoln was confined.  He also provides reminiscences, interviews and diary entries from people who knew her or were involved in the case, including one of the jurors in the 1875 trial.  The author is correct when he says, “This collection is a documentary history of Mary Lincoln’s mental illness and insanity case, and is a compilation of every possible primary source on the subject…” (xiii).</p>
<p>

Mary Lincoln emerges as a special woman with problems.  For Jason Emerson’s own opinions and interpretations, readers should look to his <i>The Madness of Mary Lincoln</i> (Southern Illinois University Press).  This volume gives readers easy access to the documents supporting his opinions.  Many may be surprised to learn that Emerson’s interpretations differ from Mary’s most recent sympathetic biographers—Jean H. Baker (<i>Mary Todd Lincoln: A Biography</i>) and Catherine Clinton (<i>Mrs. Lincoln: A Life</i>)—who both believe that Mary was forced into an asylum “by evil doctors and a heartless son” (xv).<p>
<p>
While some of these documents have appeared before, e.g., in Emerson’s <i>The Madness of Mary Lincoln</i>, and Mark E. Neely, Jr. and R. Gerald McMurtry’s <i>The Insanity File: The Case of Mary Todd Lincoln</i>, this collection is more extensive and allows readers the opportunity to make more informed judgments.</p>
<p>

Today, Mary Todd Lincoln remains more of an enigma than a reality, even as new evidence emerged in the form of a trove of letters long thought to have been destroyed (see <i>The Dark Days of Abraham Lincoln’s Widow as Revealed by Her Own Letters</i>, Southern Illinois University Press, also by Jason Emerson).  Nevertheless, her strength and intelligence cannot be discounted.</p>
<p>

Mary left the United States after her release from the asylum.  Based in Pau, France, she lived and traveled in Europe for four years.</p>
<p>

Always ranking near the bottom of the first-lady polls, even below Frances Harding, it seems Mary Lincoln deserves better.  She had great passion and a good mind, troubled as they may have been at times.  As for Robert, it may be sad justice that he also was institutionalized for depression in 1922.  Dysfunctional families and the relationships between mothers and sons have always been a part of human history and they continue to be to this day.  Leo Tolstoi said it best, “. . .every unhappy family is unhappy in its own fashion.” (Anna Karenina, Part I, ch. 1).</p>

<p>I try to write as clearly as I can, to make my points as sharply as possible, but inevitably even the best writers—those far more adept with words than I—experience the frustration of having failed to make ourselves as clear as we ought.  Having failed to make myself understood to a reader as astute as Chandra Manning, I can’t help but feel a bit humbled.  Consider her review of my recent book, <i>The Scorpion’s Sting</i>.  Manning rightly reads that little book in light of the bigger one that preceded it, <i>Freedom National</i>, which I published a year earlier.  On several occasions in her brief review, Manning reads me as saying things that are quite different from the things I intended to say.  Because there’s a lot at stake in these misunderstanding, I’m compelled to take up more space in my reply than I have any right to claim. </p>
<p>Briefly, I argue that Republican policymakers came into the Civil War with two distinct approaches to attacking slavery—a “cordon of freedom"" surrounding the South that would force the slave states to abolish slavery on their own, and military emancipation.  I tried to say, in both books, that both policies “worked""—several hundred thousand slaves were emancipated and five of the fifteen slave states abolished slavery—but that these impressive achievements were not enough to complete the destruction of slavery.  They were necessary but not sufficient.  That is, they undermined slavery enough to make a Thirteenth Amendment possible, but that only by re-writing the Constitution was slavery finally and fully destroyed. </p>
<p>Manning reads me as saying something quite different:  The “cordon of freedom"" failed.  It took military emancipation to “crush the beast."" </p>  
<p>In <i>Scorpion’s Sting</i>  I set out to emphasize that the radical abolitionist policy was the “cordon,"" not military emancipation.  Military emancipation, I argue, was a familiar and accepted policy among American statesmen from the Revolution to the Civil War.  This is a very different interpretation from the one put forward recently by my friend, John Witt, in his book <i>Lincoln’s Code</i>.  At the risk of obscuring the subtlety of Witt’s argument, it can be summarized this way.  Before 1863 all American statesmen considered military emancipation a violation of the “civilized"" usages of nations as defined by Enlightenment theorists of limited war.  <i>Lincoln’s Code</i>  thus hinges on a tragic paradox.  To justify the Emancipation Proclamation the Lincoln administration had to repudiate the Enlightenment rules of limited warfare whereas the confederates, in denouncing emancipation, upheld those Enlightenment principles. </p> 
<p>Citing Witt against me, Manning claims that American’s “typically <i>opposed</i>"" military emancipation when, from all the evidence I’ve seen, they all but universally accepted it.  Chapter four of <i>Scorpion’s Sting</i>  presents a very different history of the American understanding of military emancipation in wartime.  The Treaty of Paris, the Jay Treaty, and the Treaty of Ghent <i>all</i>  acknowledged the right of the British to emancipate slaves in wartime.  The Americans themselves offered freedom to slaves in return for military service during the War of Independence, and they again freed hundreds of slaves during the Second Seminole War</p>.  
<p>What provoked controversy beginning in the 1780s was the slaveholders’ demand that the British return to their masters all those slaves still on the ground in the United States at the moment the war ended.  The British claimed that those slaves had already been freed and could not be re-enslaved.  The slaveholders wanted those people returned to their masters or, in lieu of re-enslavement, compensation.  The British refused as a matter of principle to re-enslave anyone actually freed during the war and leading American statesmen—John Jay and Alexander Hamilton for example—denounced the demand for re-enslavement as “immoral,"" “odious,"" “infamous"" and “perfidious.""  These denunciations of re-enslavement, grounded explicitly on the Enlightenment theorists of limited war, were repeated by a number of congressmen during the Jay Treaty debates. </p>  
<p>Witt cites John Quincy Adams’s attacks on military emancipation as representative of the views of American statesmen, but I argue Adams’s remarks—whether he made them once, twice, or half a dozen times hardly matters—were extreme.  Yet not even Adams went so far as to claim that the slaves freed by the British and “carried away"" <i>before the war ended</i>  had been illegitimately emancipated.  I therefore offer an interpretation that is fundamentally at odds with Witt’s.  Where he sees the Lincoln administration reversing and the Confederacy upholding a longstanding “American"" opposition to military emancipation, I posit a longstanding American acceptance of military emancipation alongside an equally longstanding conflict over <i>re-enslavement</i>, pitting antislavery northerners against proslavery southerners. </p>
<p>Here again I apparently failed to make my own position clear.  Without realizing the depth of the disagreement Manning adopts Witt’s position as correct and on that basis characterizes my interpretation of Adams as “awkward.""  But it’s only “awkward"" if you accept Witt’s view that Adams was representative of an allegedly “universal"" American understanding of military emancipation as violation of the civilized usages of war.  I don’t think such a consensus existed, and I can’t find any American statesmen making claims as extreme as those made by Adams.  To the extent that they were <i>not</i>  extreme, it was because without quite saying so Adams did in fact accept the legitimacy of military emancipation. </p>
<p>One of the things I tried very hard to do, in both books, was to show that military emancipation was not designed to abolish slavery and rarely did.  Before the American Revolution it was not uncommon for the British authorities or American colonists to arm slaves without freeing them, but after 1776 there as something close to a consensus that arming slaves meant freeing them.  I didn’t highlight the distinction between arming and freeing slaves because, after 1776, there was no such distinction that I know of in the United States.  But I did try to make it very clear that freeing slaves <i>never</i>  meant abolishing slavery—not even in the Civil War—not even after Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation made military emancipation “universal.""  Lincoln was always skeptical of military emancipation and as late as February, 1865, argued that a constitutional amendment was necessary because his own proclamation freed only those had “come within our lines.""  Republicans in congress had been saying the same thing for a year or more. </p>
<p>Manning, by comparison, has the impression that I do not make the very distinctions I tried very hard to make.  My chapter on military emancipation, she writes, “conflates three things—arming slaves, freeing slaves, and ending slavery—that were simply too distinct to be lumped together.""  Oakes is correct, Manning notes, that armies throughout history freed slaves, “but prior wartime liberations had often been temporary and reversible, and they had not ended the institution of slavery.""  Here my frustration with my own limitations as a writer is palpable:  Manning chides for not saying the very thing I tried very to say—that military emancipation was neither designed to abolish slavery and rarely did. </p>  
<p>Ironically, it is Manning who seems to believe that military emancipation did succeed in abolishing slavery during the Civil War.  Here we may have a real disagreement rather than a misunderstanding.  That military emancipation “would permanently end the institution was and is a much bigger surprise than chapter four of <i>The Scorpion’s Sting</i>  quite credits.""  The reason I don’t credit that interpretation is because I don’t agree with it.  Which is fine.  Historians disagree all the time. </p>  
<p>My concern is that, once again, my own interpretation is not coming through as clearly as I had hoped.  The “surprise"" for me, in researching and writing about the destruction of slavery, is that military emancipation was <i>not</i>  enough to destroy slavery.  By early 1864, the Republican Party took this shortcoming for granted and for that reason adopted a constitutional amendment as the only sure way to destroy slavery completely.  As I point out in <i>Freedom National</i>, Lincoln was convinced that if he was not re-elected in 1864—which would likely mean that Republicans would lose rather than gain the seats they needed in Congress—the Union would have won the war but slavery would not have been abolished.  We can’t possibly know for sure, but I’m inclined to think Lincoln was right to worry. </p>
<p>Chandra Manning appears to have more faith than I do in the efficacy of military emancipation than I do.  She posits an “undeniable truth that it took armies, not policies, to crush the beast.""  But by her own account, armies almost never crush the beast.  Usually they unleash it.  Throughout history far more people have been enslaved by war than liberated by it.  Armies free slaves when armies are told to free slaves, told by policymakers.  War made that policy possible, but it did not make abolition inevitable.  To get slavery abolished, it took another <i>policy</i>. </p>
<p>One final point.  Manning points out that what was happening on the ground in the South was a lot messier than the policies dictated from Washington would suggest.  She appears to believe that I would dispute this, when in fact I wholeheartedly endorse it.  What I do insist upon is that we cannot possibly know that the relationship between policy and practice was until we know what the policy was, and until now historians have all but universally denied that there were any meaningful antislavery policies implemented by the Republicans before the Emancipation Proclamation.  As a result, what was going on down on the ground is consistently misinterpreted. </p>  
<p>Consider the <i>policy</i>, demanded by antislavery radicals for decades, that the fugitive slave clause of the Constitution be enforced only by local civil and judicial officials—that the federal government should <i>not</i>  be the enforcement agent.  Republicans in Congress went on record endorsing this policy early in July of 1861, and the very beginning of the war.  Very quickly—not consistently but quickly--we see Union soldiers and officers on the ground turning slaveholders away from their camps, telling the slave-catchers that if they want to recapture their fugitives they should go to local sheriffs and judges for help, that they Union Army would not do it.  Unaware that this was a <i>policy</i>  advocated for decades by antislavery radicals and affirmed by the House of Representatives early in the war, social historians dismiss the behavior of such troops.  Mistakenly assuming that there was <i>no</i>  federal policy, social historians declare that the Union soldiers were “sloughing off"" the problem on local officials.  No doubt the reality is messier than the policy, but we cannot begin to disentangle the mess from the policy until we know what the policy was. </p>
<p>An even more profound example of the problem appears in the policy, adopted by Lincoln throughout the war, of pressuring the states to abolish slavery on their own.  State by state abolition had been the focus of abolitionism since the 1780s, but by the time Arkansas abolished slavery in early 1864, it was the first state to do so in sixty years.  We know that Lincoln was frenetically urging  state officials to abolish slavery, but only a fool would argue that Arkansas abolished slavery simply because Lincoln wrote a couple of letters to General Steele.  Put differently, we know what the policy was, but we don’t how it was related to what was going on in Arkansas.  There, on the ground, the Confederate army had been defeated and expelled from the state.  Slaves were running for their freedom to Union lines.  Black soldiers were being recruited into the Union army in significant numbers, especially in the states that Lincoln was pressuring to abolish slavery.  The slaveholders had obviously been weakened enough, as a political force, to make antislavery politics viable and successful by 1864. </p>  
<p>On the one hand, we need this sort of account of what was happening on the ground—particularly, I suspect, with the recruitment of slaves into the Union army—to account for the abolition of slavery in Arkansas.  On the other hand, what was going on in Arkansas was the hardly the random byproduct of war.   Were slaves being emancipated inadvertently?  Were black soldiers enlisting by accident?  Was it serendipity that slavery was being ripped up on the ground in Arkansas?  Was it mere coincidence that after sixty long years five slave states suddenly abolished slavery?  Is federal policy really that irrelevant? </p>
<p>And here’s the point.  Manning believes that the “cordon of freedom"" designed to get states to abolish slavery was a hopeless failure.  I believe it was necessary but not sufficient to get slavery abolished.  Manning believes that military emancipation got slavery abolished.  I believe that, like state abolition, it was necessary but not sufficient.  Military emancipation certainly made state abolition more likely.  But in the end, it took a constitutional amendment destroy slavery completely and permanently—<i>and amendments have to be ratified by states</i>. Surely it matters that by the time Congress sent the Thirteenth Amendment to the states for ratification five of the fifteen slave states had abolished slavery and three more free states had been admitted to the Union.  The policy of state by state abolition, the brainchild of the abolitionist movement, made the amendment—inconceivable in 1860--feasible by 1865. </p>  
<p>Getting slavery abolished was a messy, complicated process.  I have struggled, and am still struggling, to clarify it.  That I have failed to make myself clear to a reader as knowledgeable and intelligent as Chandra Manning—whose own scholarship I deeply admire—tells me that I still have a lot of work to do. </p>
<p><b>Chandra Manning:</b></p>
<p>I am fond of saying (because I believe it) that one of the virtues of studying history is that it ought to keep us humble. When I say that, I generally mean that study of the past invites us to realize that however important we might think ourselves, we are rarely the first to face, and even more rarely, the most skilled at solving, most problems and situations. Yet sometimes it keeps us humble in even more direct ways. As a case in point, I always read a book multiple times before I write a review of it, and when I do write a review, I try very hard for the review to situate a book within the historiographical conversations that I think it challenges us to think differently about, rather than take a side or even really to state my own position; the book and how it challenges us to think, and not the reviewer, are what are important about a review, in my opinion. Yet in this case, I did indeed miss a key point of the fourth chapter, and what is more, I seem to have conveyed a position that is quite different from the one that I actually hold. And the irony of it all is that what most worries both James Oakes and I myself is that the other is missing or minimizing the exact same central point: that the destruction of slavery was far more difficult a task than anyone was ready for, and that neither policy nor military emancipation alone was enough to complete the job. </p> 
<p>The one point on which we sometimes talk past each other, and for which I especially appreciate this opportunity for clarification, is on military emancipation.  I agree completely with Oakes’ position that neither the Lieber Code nor military emancipation somehow departed from Enlightenment ideas. I have my own doubts about whether there was ever a “nice"" way of war from which to depart, as I suspect did Francis Lieber, who nearly bled to death on a battlefield of the Napoleonic War, but that is a somewhat different discussion. Yet I misread (for which <i>mea culpa</i>) Oakes as arguing that the adoption of military emancipation was so old hat that there was nothing to it in the Civil War. My concern was that in portraying its adoption as automatic, we miss some important things. </p> 
<p>One thing I think we miss is that many observers at the time saw it as a departure, and therefore that there was division rather than consensus about it. I do not think that members of the northern voting public (whose opinions mattered to the prosecution of the war) knew the post-1812 Treaty debates nearly as well as Oakes does, but I do think that they knew the “Star Spangled Banner,"" whose third verse celebrates how “no refuge could save the hireling and slave"" who tried to escape bondage. I also think they knew –because in the summer of 1862 northern newspapers reprinted—John Quincy Adams’ public statements likening military emancipation to poisoning and assassination, statements that differed so completely from the personal views that Adams expressed in his diary at the same time that it’s hard for me to see them as aberrations from rather than dutiful articulations of the position of the Monroe Cabinet on which he served. Similarly, Oakes’ treatment of the Jay Treaty and the Seminole War are without peer. I have no doubt he knows more about those things than me or the rest of the profession. I also suspect that he knows a lot more about them than most of the northern public did.  If northern newspapers are any guide, especially in the summer of 1862, the northern public was very divided about the adoption of military emancipation, not at all of a single mind that it was an obvious road to take. </p> 
<p>In sum, I think that adoption of military emancipation was more of a fight, and the outcome of the fight surprises me a little more than it surprises Oakes, but not because I doubt Republicans’ sincerity about eradicating slavery. I had hoped actually to make clear in the review that the first three chapters of <i>The Scorpion’s Sting</i>  establish that very sincerity beyond reasonable doubt. (I meant it when I said, “assign this book."") Still, while throwing the force (literally) of the U.S. government against rather than on the side of slavery did not mark a turnaround for Republicans, it <i>did</i>  mark a change in direction for a U.S. government that had spent the nineteenth-century becoming more rather than less activist on behalf of slaveholders. Portraying the process as automatic risks minimizing the degree of change it represented, in my view.  </p>
<p>I also think the outcome was surprising partly because of a concern that we don’t think too much about today, but which was very serious at the time, and that we almost always underestimate when we talk about the Civil War. That concern was the genuine, legitimate concern about the right relationship between military and civil authority. Nearly always, that concern was at the heart of what some historians have seen as (to borrow James Oakes’ phrasing) “sloughing off"" the problem of slavery onto local officials. I think that right relationship was a very serious matter to nineteenth century Americans, quite different from a cop-out, and we miss how serious if we see the move to military emancipation as automatic. </p>
<p>In addition, I think Civil War military emancipation differed in some key ways from military emancipation as it had transpired in other times and places. In my review, I missed that Oakes, too, distinguishes between earlier incidences of military emancipation and post-Emancipation Proclamation military emancipation in the Civil War. The differences are worth emphasizing, especially the most important one: in other times and places, emancipation proved fragile and reversible –in fact, the institution of slavery often emerged stronger rather than weaker—whereas after the Civil War, the institution itself was abolished. So I would caution against eliding Civil War emancipation in with all other instances of military emancipation because I do not think they are all exactly alike. </p>
<p>But I would also clarify that military emancipation in the Civil War, on its own and independent of policy, did not destroy slavery; I don’t think the “cordon of freedom"" policy was a total failure, nor do I think that military emancipation was a cheery success (to be clear: it was usually mayhem), and I fully recognize that it took military emancipation in conjunction with federal policies that culminated in the Thirteenth Amendment to legally eradicate the institution of slavery in the United States. By no means did I mean to dispute Oakes’ work on any of these points. When I say it took armies to crush the beast, what I mean is that in 1860 the institution of slavery was so firmly entrenched that there was no way of uprooting it that did not involve brute force.  I have no doubt that policy mattered and that a Union victory with slavery intact was entirely possible had different policies been enacted. But I also think that if the story becomes one solely of policy change, then slavery looks more anemic than it actually was, and we risk whitewashing the violence right out of the story. </p>
<p>And make no mistake: it was a violent story. The reason, I think, was that slavery turned out to be a much larger, more flexible, more adaptable, more resilient institution far more deeply ingrained within the very spinal cord of the nation than contemporaries (at least northern ones) fully grasped, or than we really entirely grasp if we see its eradication as a foregone conclusion. In fact, you might say that James Oakes and I are actually in “violent agreement"" on most points. I am grateful to Oakes and to the <i>Civil War Book Review</i> for the opportunity to clarify those points, partly so we understand each other better, but also because I think the questions raised about policy, violence, civil and military authority, and non-inevitability are really important ones for the field to think about with clarity and precision. </p>"	Manning, Chandra and Oakes, James	Fall 2014	2014-11-01	Classics			W.W.

2277			REDISCOVERING CIVIL WAR CLASSICS:<p>Marx's American Manifesto		Madden, David			"<p><br>""Here, Mr. President, is another letter from that little girl in London,"" Lincoln's assistant may have said. ""Is she still exhorting me not to be discouraged?"" The little girl's father, a 40-year-old Prussian Jew, raised as a Christian, living in abject poverty in London's Soho, dreaming of immigrating to America to live in Texas, was so vitally fascinated by the progress of the American Civil War that he enthralled his whole family, especially little Jenny. His name was Karl Marx. <p>He who reported on a civil war in America was at the same time conjuring up a scheme that would have an even greater tragic impact upon the history of the world. That Karl Marx observed and published articles on the Civil War for the Vienna newspaper <i>Die Presse</i> while also publishing articles at the instigation of Charles A. Dana in Horace Greeley's <i>New York Daily Tribune</i> comes as a great surprise to the millions of Americans who take an interest in the war, including some historians. I don't recall an historian ever alluding to Marx's Civil War commentary. Given the fact that Marx had already published his <i>Communist Manifesto</i> in 1848 and was at that moment in the British Museum researching Das Kapital, which would be published just two years after the war, during Reconstruction, one might reasonably expect that some historian would have examined his Civil War writing in the context of those and other works by Marx.<p>Well, what has not been done, has not been done. But what may be done? The first, easiest step,  is to read Marx's commentary, then either read his other works (have you but world enough and time) or a good summary of his basic ideas. Because Marx doesn't tell us directly what we would expect him to tell us, we must imagine. <p>The next step demands even greater effort: imagine intellectually, first, how his early writings might have influenced his comments on the issues whirling around and spinning off the Civil War, and how the war itself might have influenced his thinking as revealed in the earth-shaking <i>Das Kapital</i>; second, imagine how the ideas in all his works (written mostly in collaboration with Frederick Engels) might be appliedù-a Marxian interpretation≤to the study of the Civil War. What fresh insights might that unique perspective startle into view? Only those of us who take up this challenge will ever know. (Unless we publish our research and meditations.)<p>From 1932 to 1984, several books have gathered Marx's and Engels's newspaper articles on America. International Publishers brought out a 1937 edition entitled <i>The Civil War in the United States</i> and, more recently, its <i>Collected Works</i> contains some relevant selections (see Volume 19 [ISBN 0717805190, $24.95 hardcover] and Volume 41 [ISBN 0717805417, $24.95 hardcover]). The work that I most strongly recommend to a university press for reprinting is <b>Karl Marx On America and the Civil War</b>, which was edited, translated, and introduced by that great Jefferson scholar Saul K. Padover and published by McGraw-Hill in 1972. It includes a chronology of Marx as a journalist and writer, a chronology of the Civil War and Reconstruction, a biographical index, and an interesting choice of illustrations.<p>Marx's ""Views of America"" stretch from 1846 through 1871, augmented by personal letters from 1846 through 1881. ""The Civil War"" section offers Marx's articles from October 1861 to December 1862; those are augmented by many letters, mostly to Engels, from 1860 to 1869. With Austrians as one audience and Americans as another, Marx sees the Civil War in the context of the contemporaneous ""Mexican imbroglio"" of France and England, of the crisis in the cotton market in England and India, of a running attack on England's sympathy for slaveholders of the South, and of a chronological account of the Trent Affair. <p>His target audience is, as always, the workers of the world, the alienated underclass, whose hour would come in America when slaves freed by Lincoln would unite with the white peasants of the South and the wage slaves of the North to bring about the ""dictatorship of the proletariat."" In ""Address of the International Working Men's Association to President Johnson"" (1865), Marx writes that Lincoln was ""one of the rare men who succeed in becoming great, without ceasing to be good. Such, indeed, was the modesty of this great and good man, that the world only discovered him a hero after he had fallen a martyr."" Then he extends his admiration to Johnson: ""You will never forget that, to initiate the new era of the emancipation of labor, the American people devolved the responsibilities of leadership upon two men of labor≤the one Abraham Lincoln, the other Andrew Johnson."" <p>Simultaneously, Marx wrote often enough on China (from 1850 to 1860) to justify a separate, volume, published in 1951 (<i>Marx on China</i>, Lawrence & Wishart, 121 pp.). In view of the fact that China became, after a later civil war, one of the most powerful Communist forces on earth, it is ironic that the Christianity-inspired Taiping Civil War (1850-1865) began before the American one and continued afterwards. Six million soldiers and civilians died in that war, far less, we sadly know, than died under the heel of the Communist colossus worldwide. I propose then, as a giant further step, that we compare both those civil wars in light of Marx's revolutionary vision. Thus may we weave webs of causes and consequences where we may feel the bite of some unexpected insight.<p><i>Donald and Velvia Crumbley Professor of Creative Writing at Louisiana State University, David Madden has made notes for a primer on civil war worldwide, throughout history, but that project must wait until he has finished</i> London Bridge Is Falling Down, <i>having resigned as founding director of the United States Civil War Center in 1999 to write that novel.

5866			 LOOK AT LINCOLN: <br>Lincoln's Use of the Press		Williams, Frank J.			"<p><i>Lincoln and the Power of the Press </i>is a massive undertaking by a prolific and insightful scholar who has written over 47 books—most relating to Mr. Lincoln.</p>
<p>While some may cavil with its length and extensive background on reading the history of newspapers, their owners and publishers, most readers will come away understanding how Lincoln was able to co-op the press before and during his presidency—unheard of today by political leaders, especially since the Vietnam War and Watergate.</p>
<p>The press in Lincoln’s day was anything but impartial as independence and journalistic fairness disappeared with the rise of political parties.  Holzer writes, “The antique values of independence and journalistic impartiality, if they ever really existed, vanished with the rise of political parties and the development of…printing presses fast enough to produce some five thousand printed pages every hour.""  Readers are treated to the mind-boggling effort by Lincoln to influence newspapers as he, “never overlooked a newspaper man who had it in his power to say a good or bad thing of him.""</p>  
<p>Interrelated are the most powerful publishers of the day: Horace Greeley of the <i>New York Tribune</i>, Henry Raymond of the <i>New York Times </i>and James Gordon Bennett of the <i>New York Herald</i>.  While Holzer is judicious in portraying these famous men, he is unsparing in his depiction of their prejudices.  Lincoln’s stature grew from his debates with U.S. Senator Stephen A. Douglas in 1858 that moved him toward the Republican nomination and election in 1860.  As such, the press became more and more interested in him and he with them.</p>
<p>Essentially three themes run through this volume: 1) Lincoln as a journalist; 2) Lincoln as his own public relations agent; and 3) restrictions on the press and censorship during the Civil War condoned or initiated by the President.  This is a comprehensive agenda that offers something for nearly all readers: scholars, students, independents, liberals, conservatives and libertarians.  Though some may object to the author’s approach, Holzer’s analysis is more than grist for analyzing America’s best and most effective president.  This is a must read and essential addition to any library.</p>

3503			Blockading the American Confederacy, 1861-1865:<br>A Geo-Strategic Analysis		Hardy, Jr., James D. and Hochberg, Leonard J.			"<p>A paper to be included in a volume devoted to the comparison to the comparative history of blockages, edited by Professor Jean-David Avenal.</p><p><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p><p>Blockade, as a formal and systematic weapon in modern naval warfare, distinct from battle and maneuver, developed during the Napoleonic wars and was further refined by the Royal Navy in its decades-long campaign after 1815 to suppress the African slave trade (1).  In spite of this extensive history, it was not until the Treaty of Paris ending the Crimean War that a Declaration Respecting Maritime Law, dated April 16, 1856, formally established the general principles of international law that would define blockade and abolish privateering, blockade's traditional response.  Blockades were described in four short articles: </p><p>1.Privateering is, and remains, abolished; </p><p>2.The neutral flag covers enemy's goods, with the exception of contraband goods; </p><p>3.Neutral goods, with the exception of contraband war, are not liable to capture under enemy's flag; </p><p>4.Blockades, in order to be binding, must be effective, that is to say, maintained by a force sufficient really to prevent access to the coast of the enemy (2). </p><p>The Declaration of 1856 envisioned naval activity in terms of three simple categories, men-of-war, merchant vessels, and the now illegal privateers, or commerce raiders.  There categories had been formed by centuries of experience with sailing ships made of wood, armed with cannon effective in terms of yards.  The blockade itself was sailing squadrons patrolling seaports.  Contraband of war was thought of as guns and ammunition, while other stock in trade was regarded as ordinary commerce and exempt from seizure.  Neutrals were recognized governments that had not declared war.  The Declaration made everything perfectly clear in law and fact. </p><p>Steam power and metallurgical technology were altering all this, but the Declaration declared principles on the basis of continuity, of what was known, rather than change, or what was merely imagined.  The diplomats and admirals in Paris also assumed that Britannia would continue to rule the waves and that naval war in Europe was unlikely, making the principles of the Declaration applicable into the indefinite future.  But the principles of 1856 were soon to be tested on all the world's oceans by an unexpected conflict, the American Civil War, an were to be upheld by diplomacy and international law in the Geneva Tribunal of Arbitration (1872) after they had been found simplistic and obsolete by the experience of war. </p><p><b>Origins of the Civil War Blockade</b></p><p>Although the United States of America was not a signatory to the Declaration Respecting Maritime Law, negotiations in the spring of 1861 between Washington and London (and Paris) concerning the maritime implications of secession and Civil War proceeded upon the principles contained therein.  The initial issues, from March to May, 1861, involved the British recognition of rebellion and belligerency in the Confederacy, along with the refusal of the British and the French to give formal diplomatic recognition of the Confederacy.  The question of recognition led immediately to discussion of issues of blockade and privateering.  Have no navy, the Confederate President, Jefferson Davis, turned to commerce raiding as a way of confronting the Union at sea.  In April, 1861, Davis issued letters of marquee and reprisal, placing his regime in direct opposition to the Declaration of 1856.  President Lincoln proclaimed the southern privateers to be pirates, which, in the absence of formal diplomatic recognition of the Confederacy by major foreign governments, was not entirely inaccurate description of their status.  On April 20, 1861, a week after the Confederate shelling of Fort Sumter, President Lincoln extended war at sea by announcing a blockade on Southern ports (4).  This placed the American government within the spirit of the Declaration, though questions remained as to whether the Union blockade in the summer and fall of 1861 fell within the definition of a real impediment to trade (5), or was merely a paper blockade.  Nevertheless, the Union intent was clear.  The United States would adhere to the Declaration of 1856 and would demand that other powers did as well. </p><p><b>Nature of the Blockade</b></p><p>Once established during the summer of 1861, the Union blockade of the Confederacy became an instrument of geo-strategy that was far more sophisticated than the mere presence of naval squadrons envisioned by the signatories to the Declaration.  The American blockade, over the course of 1861 to 1862, came to consist of four distinct levels of interdiction of Southern commerce and naval warfare.  The first level was a systematic effort beginning in 1862, to conquer the Confederate littoral, including rivers and seaports.  Troops landed on the Carolina coast and occupied ports and towns, and a naval squadron ascended the Mississippi River, capturing New Orleans, Baton Rouge, and Natchez, thus closing the main pre-war artery of Southern Commerce (6).  The second level involved naval squadrons blockading the coastal sea lanes in the traditional manner.  Few and scattered in 1861, these squadrons commanded the still unconquered stretches of Southern coast by 1863 (7).  The few southern ports that remained open in the autumn of 1863, primarily Mobile, Alabama, Charleston, South Carolina, and Wilmington, North Carolina, were sufficiently patrolled that only the swiftest and most daring runners made it through the Union squadrons.  Even when successful, blockade running could not supply the import needs of a regional economy, nor get enough cotton abroad to support the Confederacy at home.  The first two levels of the Union blockade had cut the Confederacy off from the world in less than 20 months. </p><p>The third level and fourth levels of the Union blockade operated on a world stage as opposed to being concentrated on and close to the southern shore.  The third level consisted of warships roaming the oceans searching for Confederate commerce raiders, such as the Alabama.  This element of the blockade was designed to eliminate offensive Confederate naval warfare, which had the effect of driving marine insurance rates in increased war premiums to levels that threatened to choke off Union commerce (8).  Finally, a fourth level of blockade, consisting of diplomatic and intelligence services, was established in Great Britain and France to prevent Confederate ship-building abroad (9).  Although the weight of the Union effort in these two levels of blockade resided in intelligence and diplomacy rather than invasion, and in cruisers rather than fleets, the result was the same.  By the beginning of 1864, Confederate efforts to gain naval foothold in Europe or drive Union commerce from the high seas, were clearly failing, the result of Union victories in America and the cautions calculation of European governments.    </p><p>This multi-level blockade was something new in naval warfare, but by 1864, it had succeeded in destroying Confederate capacity to engage in foreign commerce or wage naval warfare (10).  It also demonstrated how complex a geo-strategic weapon, combining military, diplomatic, commercial and intelligence components, an effective naval blockade had become (and had to become) in an industrial age.  Blockades had transcended the ships at sea and encompassed civilian concerns of commerce, industry and finance, as well as wider military efforts of intelligence, diplomacy, and technology.  </p><p><b>The Union Blockade: Land and Sea</b></p><p>Although the Carolina coastal campaigns closed several smaller Southern ports, the most important strategic imitative undertaken by the Union involving the first two levels of blockade was the Mississippi River campaign in 1862 which closed the major artery of southern commerce.  New Orleans was the leading southern port in 1860, as the steamboat technology funneled the produce of the entire mid-continent down the river to the Crescent City (11).  Since there were numerous bayous and mouths of the river that connected the Mississippi to the sea, the requirement of the blockade meant that the Union must capture New Orleans and control both the river and the coast.  To that end, the Union launched a combined arms campaign, involving a fleet moving up the Mississippi to run the down-river forts of Jackson and St. Phillip and an army to occupy New Orleans and its environs after the fleet had closed the river to Confederate traffic. </p><p>  The river fortresses, Jackson and St. Phillip, had been designed in the generation before the Civil War, when land-based cannons outgunned shipboard ordnance, and steam engines were barely able to propel men of war upriver against the stiff Mississippi current.  At the time, in the 1830s, the forts had seemed adequate to the task of protecting New Orleans, but by 1862, naval technology, both in cannon and engines, had shifted the advantage from forts to ships.  The forts were the only defense New Orleans possessed.  Built up to its levies, which were lined with docks and warehouse, the city was entirely vulnerable to cannon fire.  If the blockading fleet ran the forts, surrender and occupation were the only option available to New Orleans. </p><p>So important was New Orleans to the commercial life of the Confederacy that its capture on April 25, 1862, decisively altered the first two levels of the blockade to the Union advantage.  Occupation of New Orleans added the river fleets to the Ocean blockade, transforming the blockade from a largely passive commercial interdiction into part of the military effort to occupy the Confederacy and end the war.  The war at sea became joined, on the rivers, with the war on land.  Moreover, the capture of New Orleans opened the lower Mississippi valley to Union commerce.  The plantations along the Mississippi had no choice but to continue to ship their cash crops, primarily cotton and sugar, to New Orleans, where that helped sustain the Union economy rather than sustaining the Confederacy (12).  With the conquest of New Orleans, geo-economics joined geo-strategy simultaneously producing a decisive Union victory through redirecting the commerce of the Mississippi to the benefit of the Union.  </p><p>The capture of New Orleans instantly added a strategic dimension to another combined arms campaign that had already moved south against the Confederate river fortifications in north-western Tennessee.  General U.S. Grant and Admiral Andrew Foote took Fort Henry on the lower Tennessee River on February 6, 1862, and Grant captured Fort Donaldson on the Cumberland about a week later.  These victories opened the upper Mississippi to a Union advance, and it became possible to envision Union control over the entire Mississippi valley.  Grant continued to move south, and captured Vicksburg, Mississippi, on July 4, 1863.  Two widely separated and early successes at either end of the river, one victory associated primarily with blockade and the other with invasion of the South, came together in an 18 month campaign that cut the South in half and made a Confederate victory impossible.  In the American Civil War, blockade moved in a single year from interdiction of commerce to an active instrument of conquest.  </p><p>The third and fourth levels of the Union blockade, clearing the seas of commerce raiders and preventing Confederate shipbuilding abroad, were geopolitical responses to an imaginative Confederate effort to leap over the physical blockade of their coasts.  Lacking the industrial infrastructure to build a navy at home, the Confederacy sought to build warships in England and France, thus attacking the Union commercial shipping on the high seas and creating a blockade of its own.  The Confederate assault was primarily upon the costs of commerce, particularly driving up marine insurance rates, but these tactics were not ineffective just because they were novel.  The Declaration of 1856 and Union naval strategy envisioned a physical blockade, while the Confederacy sought to counter this with a financial (and fiscal) blockade, hoping to increase the costs of trade sufficiently to drive American flag shipping into port (13).  Both sought the destruction of commerce; only the means differed (14). </p><p>The key Union efforts to establish the third and fourth levels of the maritime blockade began in 1862, and were greatly expanded after their failure to prevent the C.S.S. Alabama from getting to sea.  The Union legal and intelligence efforts in Europe were only beginning in May and June of 1862, and Confederate Captain James Bullock was able to slip the Alabama to sea on July 29 (15).  But the Union response to this contretemps was sufficiently vigorous and sustained to limit Confederate commerce raiders built in Europe from playing a critical role on the strategic level of the war (16).  It included intense diplomatic pressure on the British and French governments, an extensive intelligence effort to detect shipbuilding on the ground, and outfitting cruisers to chase down the southern commerce raiders.  On the third and fourth levels of the Union blockade, military and civilian activity merged into a single campaign in which memos and meetings had become as important as sailing and shooting. </p><p>As with the blockading squadrons and coastal conquest, the Union diplomatic and cruiser blockade prevailed on the strategic level.  Commerce raiding was the maritime equivalent of guerilla war on land.  The Confederate raiders had some striking success, but commerce raiding exhibited all the problems inherent in irregular conflict.  The raiders could not maintain consistent pressure on Union commerce, so the advantages gained proved evanescent while the Union blockade on all four levels became gradually more effective.  The raiders were hunted down and destroyed, marine insurance stabilized, Union commerce regained lost ground, and European governments steadily refused to recognize the Confederacy.  The Union blockade achieved its geo-strategic goal of cutting the Confederacy off from the world, and had done so by changing the nature and definition of a naval blockade from cutting a city or state off from the world to cutting the world off from a city or state.  </p><p><b>Consequences of the Blockade: Diplomacy and Law</b></p><p>Blockades normally end when the war does, but the differences between the United States and Great Britain over the proper role of neutrals were too great to disappear quietly after Appomattox.  The shooting in American might stop but the shouting across the Atlantic increased.  The United States Senate resolved on December 4 and 10, 1867 and again on May 27, 1868 to ask the State Department to put together the Alabama Claims against Great Britain, and that was done by April 7, 1869.  The Grant administration pursued these claims diplomatically, and on May 8, 1871, concluded in Washington a treaty with Great Britain to submit everything to a Tribunal of Arbitration to be convened at Geneva.  </p><p>The depredations of the insurgent cruisers, the Sumter, Nashville, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Shenandoah, Chickamauga, Tallahassee, and Retribution, reached a huge sum for the times, over nineteen millions in nineteenth century gold dollars, according to the <i>Claims Against Great Britain</i> submitted to the Geneva Tribunal of Arbitration (17).  Money reinforced moral outrage at assumed British connivance at what Americans saw as piratical depredations upon civilians as well as costs in treasure (precisely quantified) levied upon the United States.  The costs inflicted upon the United States and private merchants and banks by the Confederate efforts to leap over the shoreline blockade by finding support in Europe were too large to ignore and the irritation with the British was too deep to forgive. </p><p>The position of the American government was clear.  Convinced of British sympathy for the Confederacy, which was not true, the American government regarded the huge and unexpected losses as at least partially the fault of the British.  A Republican government, which was attuned to the interest of commerce and industry, was d
termined to push claims for compensation.  The British position was more ambiguous.  Though Britain defended its conduct and attitudes, the British, who would certainly be the maritime power to impose a naval blockade in the next conflict, also wanted the arbitration and diplomacy to conclude results favorable to the blockading power, which had been the United States.  The British therefore were prepared to make concessions, including allowing the dispute to come to binding arbitration, which would then turn mere claims into an agreement the British would have to honor. </p><p>Arbitration moved the debate from politics to law and economics, and in 1872, the Tribunal issued its findings and began publishing its report.  What matters is not the local findings, somewhat more favorable to the United States than might have been predicted, but the immense distance reality had wrought upon the simple formulations of the Declaration of 1856.  In Paris in 1856, a naval blockade was seen as a simple and mechanical application of naval squadron tactics.  In Geneva in 1872, a naval blockade was a complex multi-level geo-strategic activity, covering not just a coast but the whole world, involving not just ships but lawyers, insurance brokers and diplomats.  Blockades had become an entire theatre of war, evolving their own tactics and specialized weapons, along with spurring innovative techniques for breaking the blockade down.  What new forms these weapons, tactics and techniques would take could not be known in 1872, but it as clear that the experience of naval blockade during the American Civil War had rendered obsolete, even quaint, all the blockade experience that had gone before.  The geo-strategic shadow of the Civil War experience in naval blockade proved to be more durable than almost any other aspect of conflict. </p><p><b>Endnotes</b></p>1)Paul Kennedy, <i>Rise and Decline of British Naval Mastery</i>; Arthur Herman, <i>To Rule the Waves: How the British Navy Shaped the Modern World</i> (New York: HarperCollins, 2004). </p><p>2)<a href=http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/FULL/105?OpenDocument"">http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/FULL/105?OpenDocument. </a></p><p>3)The basic source for the Civil War blockade is the published papers of the Geneva Tribunal of Arbitration which adjudicated the Alabama claims within the context of the British position on neutrality and belligerency during the War.

Paper blockades were expressly prohibited by article 4 of the Declaration, but questions always remained as to how thin, exactly, a naval blockade had to be before it became just paper.  In May, 1861, the Union actually blockaded only a few southern ports, Norfolk in Virginia and Pensacola in Florida for example, but month by month the physical blockade increased.  By 1864, only three ports remained even partially opened: Mobile, Alabama; Charleston, South Carolina; and Wilmington, North Carolina. </p><p>6)For a geographic representation of this effort, see several recent atlases of the Civil War: George B.

Thank God for Jonathan Letterman<sup> 2</sup></p>
<p>
""There was not a day during World War II that I did not thank God for Jonathan Letterman.""
-Maj. Gen. Paul Hawley, Chief Surgeon, European Theater of Operations<sup>3 </sup></p>
<p>
In 1918, Maj. William Keen recalled his technique as a surgeon during the Civil War: “We operated in old blood-stained and often pus-stained coats, the veterans of a hundred fights.  We operated with clean hands in the social sense, but they were un-disinfected hands.  …  We used undisinfected instruments from undisinfected plush-lined cases, and still worse, used marine sponges which had been used in prior pus cases and had been only washed in tap water.""<sup> 4</sup></p>
<p>
Mary Phinney compared what she was observing as a nurse in Germany during the Franco-Prussian War (1870) with her experience during the Civil War: “I have been to other hospitals to-day, and I can hardly contain myself to see the treatment of the wounded.  It seems like actual murder.  We never treated amputations so badly: —head, hands without any care…  I can see now how good our surgeons were.""<sup> </sup>5</p>
<p>  
Too often, perceptions of Civil War medicine mirror the former observation.  Surgeons are frequently depicted as incompetent, drunk, never using anesthesia and amputating far too many limbs.  In the major motion picture “Dances with Wolves,"" a wounded Lt. Dunbar crawls away from the surgeon and saves his leg.  All of which begs the question: does the Civil War have any relevance on the modern-day practice of medicine?</p>
<p>
Reality was a more complex amalgamation of the above two observations.  During the war, 12,344<sup>6</sup> U.S. Army surgeons treated 75,904 cases of typhoid with 875 fatalities; 1,161,071 cases of acute diarrhea losing 6,217 patients; 235,585 gunshot wounds with 33,653 fatalities; and 983 cases of concussion with 232 deaths.<sup>7 </sup>  Of the 87,793 gunshot wounds to the upper extremities, surgeons amputated 16,147 limbs and 172 soldiers sustained amputations of two or more limbs.  Surgeons administered anesthesia in an estimated 80,000 procedures.<sup>8 </sup>  Experience improved outcomes: had the mortality rate of 25.6 percent in 1861 continued throughout the war, an additional 25,928 soldiers would have died of their injuries.<sup>9 </sup></p>
<p>
 Civil War surgeons did not have a concept of infection.  They knew that soldiers near swamps and stagnant water were likely to get a fever.  They knew that diseases spread from one person to another.  They knew that soldiers whose wounds oozed white milky pus, considered a part of the healing process, were more likely to survive than those with watery, foul-smelling pus.  They attributed disease to filth and bad odors, called miasmas, but recognized that the explanation was inadequate.</p>
<p>  
However, their dissatisfaction with prevailing theories did not necessarily lead to acceptance of the germ theory of disease.  Although now considered common sense, it is easy to forget how radical the idea that microorganisms cause disease was in the late 19th century.  The six-volume <i>Medical and Surgical History of the War of the Rebellion</i> (published 1870-1888), authored by surgeons who had served during the war, described diseases in terms of miasmas and made only two references to the germ theory of disease.  The two volumes describing disease in detail were published while other scientists, inspired by Robert Koch’s discovery in 1876 that bacterium caused anthrax, were busily linking germs to other diseases.  In one of the volumes, Joseph Woodward expressed his skepticism about the diphtheria bacterium (discovered in 1884), writing “…That the micrococci naturally present in the locality found favorable conditions for their development in the necrosed tissues, and that their multiplication is not a cause but a result of the diseased action.""<sup>10 </sup>  The center of gravity for late 19th century infectious disease research was in Germany, not the United States.</p>
<p>  
The first attempt to publically present military medicine was the founding of the Army Medical Museum on May 21, 1862.  Anatomical specimens from dead and wounded soldiers were cleaned, preserved, mounted, and displayed along with their case histories.  Although intended for the medical community, the museum was soon open to the public.  Museum staff painstakingly compiled <i>The Medical and Surgical History of the War of the Rebellion</i> from these specimens and case histories, weaving the individual data points into a complex narrative of “lessons learned.""</p>
<p>  
The Centennial Exposition of 1876 in Philadelphia provided an opportunity to layer an additional narrative onto the existing one.  An exhibit hall representing the Office of the Army Surgeon General was a replica of a pavilion hospital, including a ward, as well as exhibits featuring 241 anatomical specimens and 33 surgical patient photographs representing the individual cases.  Another room included models of hospital ships, trains, and buildings, describing a national network of hospitals that evolved during the war.<sup>11 </sup>  It was an early depiction of the emergence of health care as a system.</p>
<p>
In 1861, the Army medical organization was based on the assumption that a patient recovers faster when treated by a doctor he knows.  Regimental surgeons were assigned to garrison hospitals or deployed at the unit level.  His staff included an assistant surgeon and an enlisted Hospital Steward to help care for as many as 1,000 men.  Surgeons sent patients to general hospitals, usually appropriated warehouses or hotels, only when they were too sick to keep with the regiment.  The Regimental Band removed wounded soldiers off the battlefield to the Regimental Hospital.  Gradually, regiments consolidated the most seriously wounded into Depot Hospitals, which sometimes included surgeons and patients from opposing armies, to convalesce until well enough to be moved away from the battlefield.</p>
<p>  
This personalized approach to medicine, which mirrored civilian health care, was overwhelmed by more efficient weapons of warfare.  During battle, some Regimental Hospitals were inundated while others were idle.  Jonathan Letterman, Medical Director of the Army of the Potomac, persuaded Gen. George McClellan to create a dedicated, trained team of litter bearers, ambulance drivers, and medical logisticians.  He repurposed Regimental Hospitals as dressing stations, sending wounded requiring surgical attention to newly-created Division Field Hospitals.  Letterman had created a health care system.</p>
<p>This system proved its value at the Battle of Antietam, where almost 9,420 wounded soldiers were evacuated from the battlefield and under shelter by evening.  Other Army units soon established organizations to handle the wounded.  By December 1862, the War Department decreed that all patients be moved to a general hospital in their own state, if requested. The system expanded beyond the bounds envisioned by Letterman into the national hospital network depicted in 1876.</p>
<p>  
The network forced surgeons to share patient care with a burgeoning medical staff.  More than 24,000 men and women served as nurses, including 3,214 contract nurses, and volunteers, including Harriet Tubman, Walt Whitman, Louisa Alcott, and nuns from the Sisters of Charity.<sup>12 </sup>  The U.S. Sanitary Commission and the Christian Commission provided doctors, consultants, nurses, and social workers.  The concept of the health care team was emerging. </p>
<p>
These hospitals allowed surgeons to specialize as patients with similar conditions were concentrated.  Turner’s Lane Hospital treated nervous disorders, identifying and documenting conditions such as facial nerve paralysis and phantom limb syndrome.  Desmarres Hospital in Chicago specialized in diseases of the eye and ear.  The Confederate Army established an eye hospital near Athens, Georgia.<sup>13 </sup>  The concept of medical specialization was emerging.</p>
<p>
By the end of the Civil War, military medical care had evolved into the complex system depicted in 1876 at the exposition in Philadelphia, and became the model for how a military force should care for its casualties.  Echelons of care allowed patients to be concentrated to receive optimal treatment.  Accommodating new technology, these concepts formed the basis of the system Maj. Gen. Hawley commanded during World War II as well as to manage casualties of the current war in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>
These developments affected the practice of civilian medicine.  In 1868, Dr. Samuel Gross, President of the American Medical Association, advocated establishment of nursing schools.<sup>14 </sup>  Dr. Edward Dalton, surgeon with the Army of the Potomac, created municipal ambulance service in New York City, the origins of 911.<sup>15 </sup>  The organizational concepts developed during the war continue to influence the practice of medicine today.</p>

5039			CIVIL WAR TREASURES: <br>Civil War Newspapers at Chronicling America		Taylor, Michael			"<p>All Americans, in one way or another, felt the effects of the Civil War. Relatively few, however, experienced battles firsthand. For most, the war was something they read about in the newspaper. </p>

<p>Scholars interested in studying how the public’s knowledge and perception of the war changed as it unfolded now have a valuable electronic resource literally at their fingertips. Launched in 2004, the National Digital Newspaper Program, sponsored by the Library of Congress and the National Endowment for the Humanities, provides grants to cultural heritage institutions to digitize microfilm of historic American newspapers. The images are then made freely available on the project website,<i>Chronicling America</i> (http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov). As of 2012, more than 650 newspapers from 25 states and the District of Columbia have been digitized. These include approximately fifty from the Civil War era.  </p>

<p>Grant recipients were asked to select papers from every corner of their state. As a result, many small town or “country"" newspapers have been included in the project. One of the difficulties in using such sources, as many researchers know, has been the lack of indexes. Now, however, more than four million newspaper pages may be searched electronically by keyword, all in a matter of seconds. The<i> Chronicling America </i>project also includes brief histories of each newspaper.</p>

<p>Louisiana State University received its first NDNP grant in 2009. Its choice of Civil War-era newspapers includes titles from New Orleans, Baton Rouge, Alexandria, Plaquemines, Carrollton, and Shreveport, the last capital of the Confederacy. The papers are especially useful for studying Unionist sentiment (and its decline) in Louisiana on the eve of the Civil War. The Alexandria <i>Constitutional</i>, in fact, was originally a campaign paper for John Bell of Tennessee, the Constitutional Union Party candidate in 1860. In addition to military affairs, the papers also shed light on social and cultural life during the war. The <i>Shreveport News</i>, for example, contained announcements of concerts, plays, minstrel shows, and other public entertainments. Its “Ladies’ Corner,"" which carried recipes, household tips, and fashion advice, may be used to study domestic life on the home front.</p>

<p>In 2011, LSU received a second two-year grant that will support the digitization of 100,000 additional newspaper pages, including papers from the antebellum period. These will be a welcome addition to the many Civil War and Reconstruction-era newspapers already available in <i>Chronicling America</i>, helping to provide a full picture not only of the war, but also its causes. </p>"		Winter 2012	2012-02-01	Classics								"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=158 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/TaylorWinter2012.jpg"">"						
6051			Civil War Treasures: <br>North, South, Far East: The Civil War through Japanese Eyes		Taylor, Michael			"<p>Arriving in Nagano, Japan, in the summer of 1855 as part of a seven-nation goodwill tour sponsored by the U.S. State Department, acclaimed Southern novelist William Faulkner was astonished by the reception he received. Though he had been writing for thirty years, Faulkner’s work attracted little attention at home and even less abroad until 1949, when he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. Whether the newly minted laureate ever fully understood why the Japanese, who numbered among his biggest international fans, took an interest in his work is an open question, but similarities between Faulkner’s South and post-war Japan are not hard to find. Both had lost to the “Yankees,"" both suffered humiliating occupation at the hands of an invading army, both were intensely proud societies determined to rebuild on their own terms, for better or worse. “Japan’s loss in World War II has haunted the Japanese,"" writes literary scholar Takako Tanaka, “just as the defeat of the Civil War haunted white Southerners.""<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>Few realize that Japanese readers were already making connections between the Civil War and their own history long before they ever heard Faulkner’s name, as we learn from a book recently acquired by the LSU Libraries’ Special Collections—<i>Seiyo shinsho</i> (“New Book on the West""). </p> 

<p>Published in Tokyo in 1872, this multi-volume history of the United States contains approximately 80 woodcut illustrations and six color maps that offer fascinating and often comically inaccurate insight into how the Japanese saw Americans in the nineteenth century. At the time of the book’s publication, it had been fewer than twenty years since Commodore Matthew Calbraith Perry sailed a fleet of warships into Edo (now Tokyo) Bay and used “gunboat diplomacy"" to bully Japan into ending its strict isolationist policy. (In his 1851 novel <i>Moby Dick</i>, published the year before Perry’s departure, Herman Melville had referred to the famously self-secluded country as “that double-bolted land."") Once the latch was lifted, however, the Japanese were eager to learn about their new trading partners through books such as <i>Seiyo shinsho</i>, if only as part of a determined strategy to avoid the fate of China and other Asian countries that had fallen prey to European colonial powers. </p>

<p>One subject covered in the book—western military history—would have been of special interest in 1872. The American Civil War, in particular, or <i>nanboku senso</i> (“The North-South War"") as it is called in Japanese, was a fine example of how a western country had undergone a major social upheaval not entirely different from what had just happened in Japan. Whether the issue was slavery and states’ rights or how to deal with western intruders and the consequences of modernization, the 1850s and ‘60s saw opinions grow ever more divided and heated. In Japan, the country’s de facto ruler, the shogun, considered modernization the best defense against the west. Rural lords (daimyo) and Japan’s warrior class, the samurai, disagreed. Unhappy with the way shogunate officials were handling foreign policy and fearing collapse of the ancient social hierarchy, daimyo and samurai united behind the emperor, who up until then had had little political power. Tensions culminated in the Boshin War of 1868-69. Having defeated the shogun, the emperor then changed course, turning against the traditionalists and launching the country headlong into rapid modernization. The Meiji Restoration, as this period came to be known, saw not only technological and military advancements, but also the end of feudalism and special privileges for the elite. </p>

<p>What similarities existed between Japan’s own internal struggle and that of the Americans? Just as many in the United States argued that the nation could not continue “half slave, half free,"" so too did Japanese policymakers recognize the impracticality and ultimate impossibility of preserving a medieval society in an increasingly industrial world. Likewise, many felt that the triumph of the U.S. federal government in 1865 foreshadowed the consolidation of power under the Japanese emperor not long afterward. Southerners’ dread of abolitionists and free blacks, and especially their attempts to limit these groups’ freedom of speech by threats, deportation, and even murder, mirrored Japanese isolationists’ anxieties about and tactics for dealing with “foreign barbarians."" The mythos of national reform led by a single, enlightened figure—whether Abraham Lincoln or the Meiji Emperor—was yet another common thread. So, too, was betrayal, exemplified in Japan by the emperor’s desertion of the traditionalists and in the United States nearly a decade later by the federal government’s decision to stop enforcing civil rights for African Americans at the end of Reconstruction. </p>

<p>Other connections between Japan and the Civil War would not have been apparent to readers of <i>Seiyo shinsho</i>, but are no less interesting. There are even connections to Louisiana. The case of a Confederate warship is one of the more surprising. In 1869, zealous to build up a modern navy, the Japanese acquired the CSS <i>Stonewall</i> from the U.S. government. The 95-ton ironclad ram had been built in Bordeaux, France, five years earlier at the prompting of former Louisiana senator John Slidell, of Trent Affair fame, who was on a diplomatic mission to secure French recognition of the Confederacy. By an odd coincidence, Slidell was Commodore Perry’s brother-in-law. The Civil War ended before the <i>Stonewall</i> could be delivered to a Southern port. Renamed the <i>Kotetsu</i> (“Ironclad"") by its new Japanese owners, the ship’s first mission was to the northern island of Hokkaido to fight the last of the shogun’s supporters in the Boshin War.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>The USS <i>Mississippi</i> is another unexpected connection. Built under Perry’s personal supervision, this sleek paddlewheel frigate boasted the latest technology and served as the Commodore’s flagship on and off during his 1853 expedition to establish American relations with Japan. Like most of Perry’s fleet, it went on to see action in the Civil War. In November 1861, the <i>Mississippi</i> joined the Gulf blockading squadron off the coast of Louisiana and later participated in Admiral Farragut’s assault on the forts guarding New Orleans. The ship that had once survived a powerful typhoon off the coast of Japan said “sayonara"" on May 14, 1863, at the siege of Port Hudson. Stuck on a sand bar, her crew set her on fire to keep her from falling into Confederate hands. She eventually slid off the bar and drifted downriver for several hours before the flames reached her powder magazine. The wreck has never been salvaged. Few today realize that one of the famous <i>kurofune</i> (“black ships""), which sailed into Edo Bay as part of one of history’s most influential diplomatic missions, now lies at the bottom of her namesake, the Mississippi River, less than twenty miles north of Baton Rouge.<sup>3</sup></p>

3909			<p>CIVIL WAR TREASURES: </p>Eaton's Experiment<br>Chaplain worked to improve plight of freedmen		Jewett, Leah Wood			"<p>Collection: John Eaton Letter, Mss. 4106, Louisiana and Lower Mississippi Valley Collections, LSU Libraries, Baton Rouge, La.</p><p>Educator, graduate of the Andover seminary, and antislavery advocate John Eaton, Jr., of New Hampshire joined the 27th Ohio Regiment of Volunteers as chaplain in 1861. Eaton's work to improve the plight of former slaves, especially in light of opposition from those supporting the Union cause whose first priority were loyal white citizens, is remarkable.  A one-page letter written by Eaton to General William T. Sherman on January 30, 1864, recently cataloged as part of the Louisiana Lower Mississippi Valley Collections housed in LSU Libraries' Special Collections, illuminates the complicated history of the experimental plantation leasing system, as well as one man's individual efforts to secure a successful future for the recently enslaved.</p><p>In 1863 Eaton was appointed to serve as the Colonel of the 9th Regiment Louisiana Volunteers of African Descent (Eaton 107-108). </p><p><blockquote>It was General Grant's intention to have me make the organization under me a sort of Home Guard, - a colored military force, within the regular army, which should perform the duties required of troops in protecting the plantations, the wood-cutting operations, and the various enterprises undertaken beneath our superintendence (Eaton 107). </blockquote></p><p><blockquote>...In view of the proposed character of the regiment, we accepted as soldiers men who, though they were of a lower grade of physique than that which is acceptable in the regular army, were competent to fulfil [<i>sic</i>] all the duties of the camp wherever they might be stationed, and to resist attacks from the bands of guerillas that infested the country and threatened the plantations. The regiment [9th Regiment Louisiana Volunteers of African Descent] was filled very rapidly, and an order for a second regiment of like character was issued [which would be named the 7th Regiment Louisiana Volunteers of African Descent] (Eaton 108-109).</blockquote></p><p>The regiments were soon renamed the 63rd and 64th United States Colored infantry (Eaton 109). </p><p>At the time of Eaton's writing, Grant had risen to command of the Military Division of the Mississippi, and William T. Sherman was in command of the Department of Tennessee, under which Eaton operated.</p><p>The text of the letter follows:</p><p><blockquote>Office General Superintendent û Freedmen<br>Vicksburg, Miss.<br>January 30, 1864</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>Maj. Gen'l W. T. Sherman<br>Commanding Dept. Tenn.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>Gen'l,</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>The enclosed orders will inform you of the organization of the 9th and 7th Louisiana Regiments A. D.  their character and object. Present changes render the question of their location difficult to answer.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>I am informed by Hon. Mr. Mellen Supervising Spec. Agent Treasury Department as well as by Hon. Mr. J. E. Yeatman associated with him in the leasing of plantations and care of the labor of freedmen, that you propose to order Gen'l Ellet with his Marine Brigade, to patrol the Miss. specially within the limits in which plantations are leased perhaps the mouth of the Arkansas River and Vicksburg.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>The points around which center land cultivated by the freed people are Cannons Plantation near Natchez, protected by three companies of these regiments.  Jeff Davis' Bend, protected by your companies û both considered secure û next month (or North?) Millikens Bend, Goodrich Landing on the West-bank of the river. Skipwith's Landing, a naval station, and Greenville on the East-bank. and plantations near Helena, Ark.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>The object is to withdraw the thousands of people congregated in and around cities and camps, idle, sickening and dying; to the plantations at and near the above points, as far as possible to work for private parties, otherwise, under Gov't supervision.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>We have two companies now here for Millikens Bend, in removing the people from Island 10. and Memphis we have seven companies, which with your approbation, can be located; two at Goodrich's Landing, two at Skipwith's Landing. and three at Greenville. to guard stores and act as a rallying nucleus for the planters and all their laborers who may be armed as a sort of militia and called into action at the discretion of the officer in command. Soon no doubt each of these points will be rendered secure by the rise of the backwaters. If only small bands of robbers attack, the few companies at these points can doubtless protect themselves; if a larger force, will or will not, in your opinion, the Marine Brigade be sufficient by its concentration to repel any such larger attack, and render expedient the location of these companies severally as suggested above?</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>If this meets your approbation and receives your order, transports will be immediately needed in carrying out the plan to move the troops and the people and their supplies for which we shall be dependent on your order.</blcokquote></p><p><blockquote>The panic incident to the removal of troops from the river bank, great exposure and suffering of the people and the advancing of the season in which to employ their labor, render immediate action imperative.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>The great labor incident to your contemplated departure1  have rendered me exceedingly reluctant to harass you with these matters. But you are our authority and the command must come from you.</blockquote></p><p><blockquote>I am General<br>Very respectfully yr obdt servt-<br>John Eaton<br>Col. and Genl Supt Freedmen<br>Dept Tenn and State of Ark</blockquote></p><p>Eaton reflected later regarding the good work of the 63rd and 64th regiments:</p><p><blockquote>The bravery of the colored troops who fought in the larger engagements, such as those at Port Hudson or Milliken's Bend, thrilled the country at the time and in little danger of being forgotten by later generations, but the humbler duty of safeguarding the plantations from assaults which were often vindictive and particularly cruel, the task of protecting the women and children, the aged and inform, - these were services which devolved upon men debarred by physical incapacity from the more heroic campaigns endured by their brothers, but no whit less devoted to the Union, no whit less brave in their loyalty to the cause that had freed them, (Eaton 112).</blockquote><p><center>--------------------</center></p><p>To place Eaton's letter and overall contributions in context, it is important to consider both the historical nature of the antebellum settlement at Davis Bend, Mississippi, and the plantation leasing system in general.</p><p>Joseph Davis, eldest brother of Jefferson Davis, future President of the Confederacy, worked a plantation in a fertile curve of the Mississippi River from the late 1820s through the mid-1850s. Approximately 25 miles south of Vicksburg, the property was to be called Davis Bend and eventually included both Hurricane Plantation, owned by Joseph, and Brierfield, later owned by Jefferson (Hermann 9, 13).</p><p>As contradictory as this concept sounds to the modern researcher, it was Joseph's desire, reinforced upon a chance meeting with Utopian advocate Robert Owens, to create a model slave community based on cooperation, rather than coercion by force (Hermann 8). Unusual among his peers for his innovative approach to plantation management, Joseph took advantage of new technologies as they came available, purchasing one of the first steam-powered cotton gins in the area (Hermann 11). One of Mississippi's largest slaveholders (over 300 slaves labored on Hurricane Plantation in 1860), Joseph Davis established a court with slave jurors in order to encourage internal conflict resolution, though Davis served as the judge (Hermann 12). He supported slaves in their efforts to acquire skills and entrepreneurial endeavors (Hermann 14). </p><p>Benjamin Thornton Montgomery, considered Joseph's head slave, was an educated man in whom Joseph placed much responsibility and trust regarding the managing of Hurricane Plantation. Montgomery set up a store on the property, selling goods and services to both white and black consumers (Hermann 17-18). But although Montgomery earned the respect of many in the community, the fact remained that he was enslaved, as was his family. Purchasing their freedom and moving north was not an immediate option, as Montgomery no doubt keenly understood both his unique status at Hurricane and the protection provided to his family by Joseph (Hermann 22). </p><p>Joseph's experiment was derailed in 1862 when flooding and federal victories threatened the Davis compound. While he took some slaves and personal belongings with him as his family evacuated, many of the Davis slaves fled on their own, returning later to loot the property. Joseph's shock reflects his inability to fully comprehend the fact that only the slaveholder found the peculiar institution truly desirable and beneficial (Hermann 38). Because white overseers had also left the plantation, slave Benjamin Montgomery took over management of the plantation, providing for the slaves laboring there and ensuring that planting continued (Hermann 40-41). </p><p>When Joseph learned that some former slaves remained at work on the property, he sought assistance of Confederate troops to protect the former slaves from Union forces. As it turns out, Union troops had armed the people of Davis Bend in order to protect both property and livestock (Hermann 43). </p><p>Federal victories brought thousands of former slaves to the area, resulting in a humanitarian nightmare. In response General Ulysses S. Grant appointed Chaplain John Eaton, Jr. of the 27th Ohio to serve as Superintendent of Freedmen in 1862, calling for him to establish refugee camps in which former slaves would be fed and sheltered, and organized into groups for harvesting the cotton crop (Ross 215). </p><p>Eaton's embrace of a free-labor ideology combined several philosophical aspects, described by author Stephen Ross as a fusion of religion, morality and practical economics (Ross 215). Eaton sought to improve the plight of the freedmen. He believed charity in and of itself insufficient û his program was based on the idea of self-help, so that, in the long term, laborers could make a successful transition from slavery to freedom (Ross 216). </p><p>In February 1863 Confederate forces sunk the <i>Indianola</i>. As David Porter sought to recover the vessel, he made landing at Davis Bend. Impressed by the community at work, he enlisted Benjamin Montgomery's son, Isaiah, as his cabin boy, and worked to protect laborers in the area with naval patrols (Hermann 41-42). Montgomery eventually moved his family to Cincinnati to escape the chaos of war (Hermann 42). </p><p>Modeled after an existing contract labor system in Louisiana established under General Benjamin Butler and expanded by General Nathaniel P. Banks, in 1863 Adjutant General Lorenzo Thomas established a plantation leasing program for the Mississippi River Valley, an extension of his duties as a recruiter of black troops (Foner 55-57). </p><p>Building on the existing efforts of the community of laborers at Davis Bend upon instructions from Grant after the fall of Vicksburg, Eaton enacted a two-fold approach regarding the plantation lessee program in which the federal government seized lands abandoned by Confederate sympathizers, and subdivided it among lessees for cultivation (Ross 218). Eaton worked to establish what were called Home Farms, temporary homes for invalids and the unemployed, where any profit from labor on these tracts was to be placed in a general Freedmen's Fund for the benefit of the group as a whole. In addition, the plan allowed lessees (individuals and/or private companies) to establish individual contracts with laborers for cultivation, subject to approval by Eaton's department (Ross 217). </p><p>The lure of fast fortune proved irresistible to many an unscrupulous northern speculator, threatening Eaton's plan to assist the freedmen (Ross 217). In response, Eaton worked to lease to independent black farmers before opening leasing opportunities to whites (Ross 217-219).</p><p>Aware of the potential for slaves to be taken advantage of by corrupt Union officers, Eaton sought a like-minded individual devoted to the cause of freedmen to assist him. Samuel Thomas, who had served as a captain in the 27th Ohio, fit the bill. Eaton appointed him in August 1863 to organize and protect freedmen in Vicksburg (Hermann 45-46). Eaton continued service as the General Superintendent of Freedmen for the Department of Tennessee, including Arkansas, while on active duty as the colonel of the 9th Louisiana A.D. (Eaton 111).</p><p>Rampant fraud and corruption regarding distribution of confiscated Confederate property led Congress to assign the management of plantation lessee program to the Treasury Department. William P. Mellen, Supervising Agent of the Treasury, along with James E. Yeatman, President of the independent Western Sanitary Commission, worked to protect freedmen from abuse and established regulations regarding the plantation leasing program (Hermann 48).</p><p>Lessees complained that the instituted changes to Thomas's original program, including an increase in wages, benefitted black laborers to the detriment of loyal white men (Bigelow 358). In addition lessees faced frequent raids from Confederates, and laborers were often recruited for service in the Union army (Wiley 445-446). Eventually President Abraham Lincoln returned the plantation leasing system to the control of the military (Gerteis 60). This political tug of war surely harmed laborers the most. </p><p>The final blow to the system came near the end of the war, in the form of amnesty toward former plantation owners who signed the loyalty oath; property promised to freedmen was revoked and returned to former owners (Hermann 50). Continuing the trend in the post-war period, President Andrew Johnson pardoned many a native planter, including Joseph Davis. Concerned about federal revocation of the return, Davis sold the property as a whole to Benjamin Montgomery2, still living in Cincinnati at the time (Ross 227). While the leasing/free labor system did not continue as Eaton had envisioned, it did prove that freemen could work for their own benefit and be productive citizens, though this lesson was not integrated into either federal Reconstruction programs or attitudes toward freedmen) (Ross 228). </p><p><center>--------------------</center></p> <p>After the war, among other accomplishments, Eaton served as editor of the newspaper <i>Memphis Post</i>, participated in U.S. Grant's campaign for president, and became the first head of the U.S. Bureau of Education (Eaton xvii û xxxi).  </p><p>1 - Eaton may be referring to Sherman's Meridian Campaign that would take place in February 1864, considered by author Kevin Daugherty as a practice run for the March to the Sea. (Dougherty 1).</p><p>2 û Both Montgomery and his son, Isaiah, worked to maintain the free black agrarian community after the war. The name of the community was later changed to Mound Bayou, and functioned with various degrees of success until Isaiah's death in the 1920s.</p><p>Sources cited:</p><p>Bigelow, Martha M.

Randall in his article Captured and Abandoned Property During the Civil War (<i>The American Historical Review</i>: Vol. 19, No.1, October 1913) was a primary target of confiscation:</p><blockquote><p>àOver ninety-five per cent of the property handled by the treasury agents was cottonàBeing the greatest staple product of the South, it was regarded as their most valuable source of wealth, and was held to contribute so directly to the support of the Rebellion that it should not be regarded in the same light as ordinary private property. It was declared by the Supreme Court to be a proper subject for capture by the Union authorities during the Civil War, and not to be protected by the general rule of international law which condemns the seizure of private property on land (Randall 69). </p></blockquote><p>Aware of the fact that personal property, such as cotton, was likely to be seized by either army, planters went to great lengths to hide or destroy it (Randall 67).  </p><p>It was the discovery and subsequent confiscation of such cotton that prompted Captain Thomas F. Purnell, Regimental Quartermaster, 54th Indiana Infantry, to write this short report outlining his brief but memorable interaction with cotton planter and secessionist Samuel Templeton and his wife. Templeton, a 53 year-old Kentucky native, was among the largest slaveholders in the state, enslaving over 100 people in 1860 (Menn 183-184):</p><p>Purnell's report (edited):</p><p>Quartermaster's OfficeGoodrich's Landing, LA</p><p>November 22, 1863</p><p>Brig.

Wood who had charge of an expedition to Bayou Macon the last of September and returned to camp the 1st day of October who gave me the following statements: Sixty One (61) bales of Cotton2 found in Bayou Macon said to belong to a Mr. Templeton was raised on Joes Bayou and carried over to the west bank of Bayou-Macon where it was found. Nothing was stated of the character of Templeton and I knew nothing certain of him until he came in accompanied by his wife to gain information of or recover his cotton. I questioned him as to his loyalty when he informed me that his sympathies his interests and his feelings were with the South and in answer to a question from Colonel Kirkam he further stated that he would not take the oath of allegiance to the United States Government for all the cotton & mules in the South. Finding that all appeals from himself and wife were in vain he called me out and proposed to give me half the proceeds of the sale of the cotton if I would assist him in getting his cotton released. This proposition suddenly closed my interview with Templeton and his wife.  I gave him such an answer as will forbid his calling at my office again, and hence his application to other persons & places. He professes no good feelings towards our Government, and certainly shows a low estimate of the honesty of our public officers. If such a man as this Samuel Templeton should succeed in getting his property out of the hands of any of our Government's officers after it has been delivered with all the facts  accompanying it, my confidence in the integrity of such officers will be greatly shaken.</p><p>Furthermore  Mrs. Templeton the wife of the said Samuel Templeton at the same time and in the same place made a demand for Eighty (80) bales of Cotton hauled in by teams under charge of Colonel Wood which cotton was marked W. Wiley. I had received information that the Wileys who owned this cotton were in the rebel army and so informed her she stated that the cotton belonged to the estate of her father who was deceased and belonged to herself and her two brothers. I then stated that I understood her two brothers were in the rebel army she said she was not accountable for her brothers and only wished to recover his interested in the cotton. She did not deny that her brothers were in the rebel service. Under these circumstances I could not give her or her husband any aid in recovering their cotton for the reason that they are not even well disposed to the United States Government. I make this last statement because a man calling himself Wiley and acknowledges to be the brother of Mrs. Samuel Templeton claims to own the Eighty bales of cotton in the face of this evidence that the cotton is the property of the estate of the father deceased and belongs to the heirs of said estate,</p><p>Very Respectfully <br>Your Obedient Servant<br>Thomas F.

Louisiana</p><p>The Abandoned and Captured Property Act had made provisions for Southern Unionists to file claims for their property's return (or, more likely, the funds obtained from the sale of the property) (Randall 70). Against opposition by Radical Republicans Congress established the Southern Claims Commission in 1871 in order to process the requests for reimbursement filed by citizens of the South who had remained loyal to the Union throughout the Civil War, and whose property was confiscated by the Union army during the conflict  (Klingberg 199). </p><p>Inasmuch as proving steadfast allegiance was critical to a successful application to the commission, it is no surprise that Samuel Templeton did not file a claim (United States, National Archives).  And he was not alone. With Louisiana responsible for one-sixth of the entire US cotton crop in 1860, no doubt many of his cotton planting neighbors in north Louisiana were in the same situation (Louisiana State Museum ). He and his neighbors were then forced to file suit as individuals û or win a presidential pardon from President Johnson û in order to secure their property's return. (Hamilton 261). </p><p>Enforcement of the confiscation acts was capricious at best. To the disappointment of Radical Republicans, confiscated Confederate property did not end up in the hands of freedmen (Hamilton 257). Johnson's pardons and restoration of property rights muddied the post-war legal waters regarding seized property for years to come Johnson's actions also undermined the authority of acts relating to property seizure and  the Freedmen's Bureau  (Hamilton 261).It is unclear as to whether or not Templeton or his heirs received compensation. But the topic of confiscated property does shed light on the larger issues of the status of freedmen and former Confederates, and the stark differences between those in Congress who sought to punish the South and those who looked forward to political and economic reunion.  Cotton picking was indeed a prickly business, in more ways than one.</p><p>Notes</p> <p>1-This act was created to work in concert with two previously established confiscation acts. The first act, passed in August 1861, targeted real and personal property held by individuals directly participating in the Confederate war effort. This property was to be permanently transferred to the federal government. The Second Confiscation Act of 1862 included anyone who was offering any kind of support to the Confederacy  (Hamilton 254) Slaves could be seized and freed in Union held territories under the Second Confiscation Act (Syrett  477).. Contemporary debates over the acts included arguments that the property seizure, especially in the case of Unionists, should be considered a temporary measure.  </p><p>2-One bale was roughly 500 pounds, and sold in 1863 from 30 to 45 cents per pound according to <i>De Bow's Review</i>, post-war volumes 36 and 37.</p>-<p>Sources</p><p><i>DeBow's Review</i>, Vol. 36, New Orleans: J.D.B.

5989			Civil War Treasures: <br>LSU's Lincoln Lexicon		Taylor, Michael			"<p>Few have ever mastered the English language like Abraham Lincoln. From his days as a young, backwoods bibliophile to one of history’s most expressive writers, Lincoln’s love of language helps us understand not only the man, but all that he represents. </p>

<p>How did Lincoln acquire his remarkable way with words? An eighteenth-century dictionary now in the LSU Libraries’ Special Collections sheds some light on the question. </p>

<p>First published in 1721 and reissued many times over the next eighty years, Nathan Bailey’s <i>Universal Etymological English Dictionary</i> was the most successful lexicon of its time. Though printed in London, copies would have been found throughout the English-speaking world. In the new state of Kentucky, Mordecai Lincoln, the future president’s uncle and one of the most influential figures in his early life, owned a copy as early as 1792. </p> 

<p>Scrawled in the margins next to Bailey’s definitions of catfish and castanets are the words: “<i>Mordecai Lincoln, his hand and pen, he will be good, but God knows when. When he is good, then you may say, the time is come and well hurray. </i>"" </p>

<p>Thirty years later, the first part of this jovial rhyme shows up in a copybook, written in southern Indiana by a teenage Abraham Lincoln. The copybook may be the earliest surviving example of his writing.<sup>1</sup>  Scholars have been unsure whether Lincoln coined the rhyme himself or copied it from an unknown source. LSU’s copy of Bailey’s dictionary presents evidence that the phrase was probably being used as a penmanship exercise in the Lincoln family long before their most famous son repeated it. </p>

<p>Mordecai Lincoln was clearly glad to own a copy of the dictionary. In addition to including his name in the verse mentioned above, he inscribed it in two other places: first on the page headed by the word <i>unalterable</i>, alongside the date “April 28, 1792,"" then adjacent to a description of the English city of Lincoln. And at the middle of a group of pages discolored by some type of memento once stuck between them, we find the definition of the Hebrew name Mordecai (“Queen Esther’s guardian""). </p>

<p>Most intriguing is the front endpaper. Though badly mutilated, it still bears the inscription “Abraham Lincoln, his book, brought [sic] in the year of our Lord 1795."" Above this inscription is another that has almost disappeared due to paper loss, but the date 1772 is still visible, as well as the partial word “Linc—,""  presumably a sign that other Lincolns owned the book before Mordecai. </p>

<p>The rhyming inscription and the fact that we know Abraham Lincoln read dictionaries in his youth has led several historians to believe this was one of the books that passed through his hands. Though he may have borrowed the book from his uncle, it is far more plausible that the “Abraham Lincoln"" of the inscription is the president’s cousin, Mordecai’s son Abraham, who was born around 1795. Could the mysterious usage of the word <i>brought</i> refer to his birth—i.e., brought forth? The word has mistakenly been given as <i>bought</i> by historians. The original may be a simple misspelling, but no matter what it signifies, it is hard to see how it could apply to the president, who was not born until 1809. </p>

<p>Indiana Senator Albert Beveridge, author of a well-known 1928 biography of Lincoln, was the foremost advocate of a connection between Bailey’s dictionary and the erstwhile Hoosier. Beveridge knew about the volume through James A. McMillen, librarian at Washington University in St. Louis and later library director at LSU.<sup>2</sup>  McMillen claimed to have acquired the book from his aunt, who in 1879 found it in a Hancock County, Illinois, house formerly occupied by one of Lincoln’s cousins—or, some say, by “Honest Abe"" himself.<sup>3</sup>  (Mordecai’s son Abraham died in Hancock County in 1852, more reason to believe that the book belonged to him and not the president).<sup>4</sup> When we trace Beveridge’s footnotes, it is clear that he confused Bailey’s dictionary with James Barclay’s, a book the young Lincoln cherished.<sup>5</sup> Yet writers on Lincoln have reproduced Beveridge’s error over the years. </p>

<p>Regardless of whether Lincoln ever read from his uncle’s copy of Bailey’s dictionary, it is a testimony to his legacy that so many have wanted this to be a tangible relic of his life. Even if it is not what some have claimed, the book does, in fact, advance our understanding of Lincoln. Though he was unusually bright, those around him were not all as suspicious of “book larnin’"" as his father, Thomas, is supposed to have been. At least one other member of the Lincoln family, we can be sure, found a dictionary to be a valuable object. Did he simply use it to better understand the Bible, or did he have grander aspirations? We may never know, but this small window into the world in which Lincoln grew up is a fascinating example of the kinds of questions scholars can raise by exploring the riches of the LSU Libraries’ Special Collections. </p>

5929			CIVIL WAR SESQUICENTENNIAL: <br>Unfurling the Black Flag in Civil War History		Phillips, Christopher			"<p>Fifteen years have passed since Daniel E. Sutherland unfurled the black flag and declared the guerrilla conflict in the Civil War a “sideshow no longer.""  Long seen as a product of aberrant individualism, a legacy of frontier conflicts, or a facet of southern cultural violence (interpretive tropes popularized by Michael Fellman in his seminal <i>Inside War: The Guerrilla Conflict in Missouri During the American Civil War</i>, published in 1989), Sutherland argued that this “desperate side of the Civil War,"" as he aptly termed guerrilla warfare, was in fact a central element.  Widespread irregular warfare deeply affected federal policy and strategy, and when federal troops waged a destructive and retaliatory war against southern civilians in order to break their will to fight, it debilitated the Confederate war effort and contributed to defeat. </p>
<p>That the word <i>guerrilla</i> translates to “small war"" is only the most obvious of the ironies surrounding the internecine warfare that the war produced even in its earliest days.  Guerrilla warfare did not begin with the Confederacy’s Partisan Ranger Act, passed on April 21, 1862.  Independent irregular bands had roamed in parts of the nation for nearly a year, especially Missouri, western Virginia, and eastern Tennessee.  Indeed, the pervasive fear of  marauding parties"" from neighboring slave states, real as well as imagined, had driven unionists in many free states to organize border patrols and home guards with the sanction of their anxious state legislatures.  Some crossed state lines or rivers and acted the part of bushwhackers as much as the gangs they sought.  Retaliatory warfare soon followed.  In the war’s first months, night riders stole horses and saboteurs destroyed railroads, trestles, and bridges.  Soon enough, they attacked other symbols of federal authority, including banks, trains, riverboats, and stagecoaches, and frequently interrupted mail, fired at boats, or derailed trains while women and children were aboard. </p>
<p>Sutherland’s contention that guerrilla war was in fact a mainstream form of Civil War-making was soon aided by current events in the form of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts, with grisly images of beheadings, IEDs, ambushes, and suicide bombings, shaking the public’s sensibilities about honorable warfare and warriors in this new age of terrorism.  The 2009 publication of his <i>A Savage Conflict: The Decisive Role of Guerrillas in the American Civil War</i> brought recognition in the form of major awards and the sideshow’s move to the Big Top. </p>
<p>As Sutherland moved pro-Confederate guerrillas from the war’s interpretive side tent, he rescued them from the realm of fawning biographies, which commenced nearly as the war ended.  Painting their subjects as chivalrous southern defenders of home and hearth, these portrayals allowed for a strict, and ultimately partisanized, separation of guerrillas (or the more pejorative bushwhackers or brigands) from partisans and cavalry raiders.  Such categorization aided the romantic southernization of such commanders as John Hunt Morgan, John Mosby (taken up in historian James A. Ramage’s biographical treatments of both), M. Jeff Thompson, Joseph O. Shelby, and especially William C. Quantrill.  Military professionals such as Robert R. Mackey swooped into the void, using post-Vietnam command school terminology to create categories for the wide array of irregular combatants.  Mackey’s <i>The Uncivil War: Irregular Warfare in the Upper South, 1861-1865</i>, published in 2005 just before Sutherland’s book, offered a too-strict typology of the various fighters who warred outside the formal ranks. Ironically, he conflated most pro-Confederate irregulars as terrorists and brigands.  Sutherland allowed more flexibility in his categories, but maintained something of a hard line between regular, meaning Confederate and federal cavalry, and irregular fighters. </p>
<p>But those lines were always blurred, and partisan.  Even as the war unfolded, imprecision assisted with the politicization of the shadow warriors who bedeviled federal and state troops especially in the Border States and Upper South, shading the lines between regular and irregular warfare, guerrillas and cavalry.  Wartime unionists indiscriminately referred to armed men roaming the roads—whether draft dodgers, partisans, outlaws, or farmers—as guerrillas.  All were seen as potential threats.  The Shakers at South Union, Kentucky, expanded the term to include armed Confederates generally, and southern sympathizers claimed them as a modern incarnation of partisans, who had helped to win an earlier war of independence, thus applying the term to the newest home-front heroes.  Even as some of them threatened to burn her home, pro-Confederate Missourian Elvira A. W. Scott characterized bushwhackers as good-looking, polite, and intelligent . . . the best and bravest of the land, who have been wronged and outraged beyond endurance and have resolved to avenge their wrongs.   Unionists like Kentuckian George D. Prentice, the irascible editor of the Louisville <i>Journal </i>and by 1863 a harsh critic of Lincoln, ridiculed such hair-splitting, condemning John Hunt Morgan as a guerrilla for attacking disguised in federal uniforms under flags of truce, common ruses in neighboring Missouri and Tennessee. </p>
<p>Guerrillas might have been the most feared purveyors of political violence, but they were only one of many interest groups to traffic in it.  The violence that emerged from these “everyday forms of ideological struggle,"" as scholar James C. Scott has written of more recent conflicts, were expressions of a pervasive, mature home-front insurgency often hidden from view.  Guerrillas sought more than simple security; they fought for wartime power and advantage by waging shadowy conflicts that took various forms and produced many targets of opportunity. </p>
<p>If the current spate of interest in (and scholarship on) Civil War guerrillas derives in some part from seeking explanation for the “just"" wars waged by Islamic jihadists in the Middle East and central Asia, central components of the long “war on terror,"" these works mostly lack ideological explanations of guerrillas’ motivations.  Indeed, war-weary Americans have become aware of modern insurgents’ keen reckoning of benchmark dates, using them to initiate new violence for partisan effect.  Likely not coincidentally, Jo Shelby’s “Great Raid"" into Missouri commenced on September 22, 1863, the one-year anniversary of Abraham Lincoln’s announcement of his Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation.  That it commenced barely a month after the brutal attack on Lawrence, Kansas, by William Quantrill’s band, itself a response to federal general Thomas Ewing’s infamous Order No. 11 that depopulated nearly four Missouri counties in order to undercut the guerrillas’ “domestic supply line,"" as historian LeeAnn Whites characterizes homefront women's support of guerillas, by making war on disloyal civilians, confirms the western dimension of the now-accepted trajectory toward a much harder war.  That the Raid was conceived and commanded by the reputed wealthiest man in his border state—a Missouri hemp planter and rope manufacturer whose home county, Lafayette, was among the state’s largest slaveowning counties and whose family owned collectively nearly 150 slaves and who, during the Missouri-Kansas Border War, led two forays of proslavery activists into the territory and participated in 1856 in the prior sack of Lawrence, for proslavery western Missourians the self-styled abolitionist capital—suggests an ideological as much as strategic motive for the Raid. </p>
<p>The ideological foundations for guerrilla warfare bore early fruit in Missouri, showing even as the war commenced.  As Mark W. Geiger found in his innovative <i>Financial Fraud and Guerrilla Violence in Missouri’s Civil War, 1861-1965</i> (2010), material realities were entwined with guerrilla proclivities.  Pro-Confederate Missourians hailed disproportionately from the upper strata of rural society, and had for years been engaging in for-profit commercial agriculture reliant on slave labor.  They invested heavily in railroad construction during the 1850s, became deeply indebted to local bankers, and when federal and state authorities took over the banks in late 1861, many saw their farms and slaves auctioned, denying sons their economic and cultural inheritances.  Many responded not by enlisting in the Confederate service, but by becoming irregulars who would wage war on those who had robbed them.  In the Boon’s Lick, four-fifths of identified “bushwhackers"" came from indebted families whose property was sold in the estate sales.  The families of guerrillas in one western Missouri county were three times as likely to have owned slaves and were twice as likely to have possessed real wealth, including slaves, as an average white male Missourian.  As guerrillas, these slaveholding scions thus made common violent cause with desperate men from the bottom of their society.  Not surprisingly, counties that suffered the greatest frequency of guerrilla violence over the course of the war also had the greatest incidence of these bank foreclosures. </p>
 <p>That slavery and emancipation provided a fulcrum for ideological warriors on both sides finds its strongest voice in John Fabian Witt’s serial prize-winning <i>Lincoln’s Code: The Laws of War in American History </i> (2012).  The rapid expansion of guerrilla warfare in 1862 and the many and varied irregular fighters plaguing the war effort from behind the lines drew Francis W. Lieber, a published expert on international laws of war then lecturing at Columbia University, to offer a legal framework for combating them.  A former slaveholder turned abolitionist, Lieber traveled to Virginia and met with Benjamin Butler, who famously refused to return slave “contrabands,"" before setting to work.  The essay he produced emphasized the centrality of slavery to the war effort and condemned most irregulars as outlaws who should be denied rights as legitimate soldiers.  At Henry W. Halleck’s invitation, Lieber headed a war department committee that fashioned carefully ranked categories of irregular combatants by which to assign appropriate punishments.  Lieber established limits to wartime behaviors of armies and governments, especially to retaliatory targeting of black soldiers and their white officers, while advocating “the more elastic limit of military necessity"" to respond to guerrilla warfare.  He included the term “guerrilla"" among such terms as “robbers, pirates, armed prowlers, and war-rebels,"" in effect it classified all irregulars as outside the “laws of warfare"" and denying them the rights of legitimate soldiers.  Calling for the military’s restraint in administering punishment, he subjected civilians to it who aided guerrillas, including women.  In April 1863, Lincoln approved what was issued as General Orders No. 100, known since as the Lieber Code,  defining as military necessity all measures  indispensable for securing the ends of the war.""  The order provided constitutional sanction to many of the Lincoln government s recent initiatives—martial law, suspension of habeas corpus, confiscation of the property of the disloyal, and emancipation—as well as allowing for capital and summary punishment of guerrillas.  Lieber’s expanded vision of military necessity had a political complement.  Delivering a jeremiad to New York s Loyal League entitled “No Party Now But All for Our Country, he offered Republicans an exclusivist blueprint for all-or-nothing patriotism against home-front dissenters.  For Lieber, the genesis of his Code, and for guerrilla or other partisan warfare, was slavery. </p> 
<p>Breaking the mold for sympathetic biographies of pro-Confederate irregular fighters, and blending the ideological guerrilla war with its postwar legacy, T. J. Stiles’s <i>Jesse James: The Last Rebel of the Civil War</i> (2002) offers the most thorough treatment of a guerrilla as both terrorist and cold warrior.  With lively narrative supported by exhaustive research, Stiles argues persuasively that James was a jihadist of a different kind, both wartime and postwar.  No social bandit, to use historian Eric Hobsbawm’s phrase, or a Robin Hood who robbed from the rich and gave to the poor, as popular lore has him, James fought as a guerrilla in the war to defend his family and his home by preserving its way of life in one of Missouri’s most slave-rich counties.  After the war, he combined political violence with ordinary crime, fighting former unionists and the federal government’s efforts at Reconstruction—or the form it took in Missouri where it was not mandated, nearly as did the Ku Kluxers there and in the former Confederacy.  Opposition to wartime emancipation expressed as racial violence was a central pillar of the temple of guerrilla warfare, and extended fully into the postwar, as Aaron Astor argues well in <i>Rebels on the Border: Civil War, Emancipation, and the Reconstruction of Kentucky and Missouri</i> (2012).  Among them were James and his gang members and innumerable other former guerrillas who intimidated free blacks, terrorized Radical voters and candidates, and publicized their views and actions as extensions of Confederate policies.  (James did so by way of Kansas City journalist and former Confederate officer John Newman Edwards.  Edwards, who historian Matthew C. Hulbert argues took the lead in constructing an “irregular memory"" of the war for the state’s angry former Confederate sympathizing electorate, gave James a platform not only to justify his robberies of trains and banks but to attack Republican-led Reconstruction throughout postwar America.) </p>  
<p>As recent scholarship makes clear, once military necessity included slavery’s destruction, irregular violence became a medium of social exchange and ideological litmus of political warfare.  Although this violence was prevalent in all the region’s states, the degree of violence was highest in those states where slavery existed and especially once black enlistment was underway in all states.  Emancipation fully entwined political and military goals, and common people resisted what they considered an illegitimate social revolution with what means they had.  Among them was violence, of which guerrilla warfare might have been a weapon of the weak but offered a position of strength that affected the trajectory of the war and its political aftermath.

6114			COLUMN: <br>The Centennial, the Sesquicentennial, and the Lost Cause in American Society		Cook, Robert J.			"<p>Four years ago – how time flies – I contributed to a <i>Civil War History</i> roundtable looking ahead to the Sesquicentennial commemoration in the context of its ill-fated Centennial predecessor in the 1960s.<sup>1</sup> I predicted a well-intentioned but low-key ‘event’ that would be far more inclusive than the Centennial but perhaps less successful in its capacity to excite the  American public. I also suggested that the Sesquicentennial would only make the headlines if a major racial controversy occurred – one comparable to the exclusion of black delegate Madaline Williams from a hotel hosting an official Centennial gathering in Charleston, South Carolina, in March 1961. While I make no claims to be a fortune-teller (let’s face it, it’s hard enough trying to interpret the past) the Sesquicentennial passed off as quietly as I thought it would do. The period between April 2011 and April 2015 did witness several high-profile incidents reminding us that the civil rights revolution of the 1960s has not ended the oppression of African Americans. One thinks, for example, of the fatal shooting of black teenager Treyvon Martin by an armed vigilante in Sanford, Florida, in February 2012 and the police killing of Michael Brown in August 2014 that triggered weeks of unrest in the St Louis suburb of Ferguson. Instructive though these cases were, however, they had no direct link to the ongoing Sesquicentennial which therefore continued its largely untroubled progress until its conclusion this spring. </p>
<p>One reason why the Sesquicentennial passed off so quietly was the organizers’ stress on racial inclusivity. Although Congress opted not to set up a federal  commission to oversee Sesquicentennial events, its landmark decision in 2000 to ‘encourage’ the National Park Service to incorporate slavery into its interpretive narratives helped  lay the foundations for an interracial commemoration – one that took full account of African Americans’ remembrance of the Civil War as a watershed moment in US history that was intrinsically connected to the history of slavery, black military service on behalf of the Union, and, of course, emancipation.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>In marked contrast to their Centennial peers, Sesquicentennial  planners at every level took steps to involve African Americans as well as southern and non-southern whites in their commemorative schedules. While Park Service sites such as Gettysburg, Petersburg, and Harpers Ferry incorporated racial themes in their interpretive displays, southern state organizers and museum curators made sterling efforts to attract African American visitors to their events. The energetic and well-funded Virginia Sesquicentennial Commission, for example, launched a successful series of annual conferences on the Civil War that included one gathering devoted solely to the subject of race and slavery. Its North Carolina counterpart – a committee rather than a commission – planned what it described as ‘a multi-year program of state-sponsored activities to commemorate, in an appropriate and historically accurate manner, the richness, diversity, and significance of the state’s participation in and contributions to the American Civil War.’<sup>3</sup> Events organized under this rubric included a conference entitled ‘Lay Down My Burden: Freedom and the Legacies of the Civil War’ that was held in Winston-Salem in October 2013. </p>
<p>Whereas military history had dominated Centennial planning, Sesquicentennial organizers looked to persuade Americans that they could not understand the Civil War simply as a series of battles. Their thrust was therefore educational as well as inclusive. Fifty years ago liberal historians including Bruce Catton, Allan Nevins, and Bell Wiley – each committed to the idea that high-quality history was essential to the maintenance of a healthy democracy in the United States – rescued the embarrassing Centennial from disaster by altering the commemoration’s official focus from commercialized pageantry to serious scholarship. The downside to this shift, however, was a decline in popular interest. Ordinary Americans, especially children, were genuinely excited by the Centennial in part because of the accompanying commercial paraphernalia – most of it focused on generals and battles. </p>
<p>The educational focus of the Sesquicentennial inhibited business involvement in the commemoration, thereby limiting the event’s salience in the public consciousness. One disenchanted manufacturer of toy soldiers was quoted in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> as saying, ‘If it’s a celebration, it’s a celebration that the public is either not aware of or not interested in.’<sup>4</sup> This negative description cannot stand as an adequate summation of the Sesquicentennial. The <i>New York Times’</i> popular Disunion blog sparked many intelligent debates and there is no question that visitors to many of the battlefields as well as to museums such as the American Civil War Museum in Richmond received a more balanced account of the war than their peers were given at these kind of sites in the early 1960s. The Sesquicentennial may have touched fewer people than the Centennial but those who were touched by it garnered a far more thoughtful and informed appraisal of the Civil War – one that in many respects justified the early hopes of historian David W. Blight for an adult commemoration that would give Americans the chance ‘to find unity in a shared history of conflict, in a genuine sense of tragedy, and in a conflicted memory stared squarely in the face.’ <sup>5</sup></p>
<p>Then came the brutal murder of nine African Americans attending an evening Bible class at the historic Emanuel AMA Church in Charleston on 17 June 2015. Unlike the deaths of Trayvon Martin or Michael Brown, this proved to be an outrage that did alert Americans to the ways in which their ghastly civil war is remembered. Perceptions were changed less by the scale of the massacre than by the fact that the perpetrator, Dylann Storm Roof, was a committed white supremacist who viewed the past and the present through the lens of neo-Confederacy. His allegiance to this contemporary manifestation of a nineteenth-century worldview was uncovered by the swift appearance on the internet of photographs of Roof posing with the Rebel battle flag and a Confederate automobile license plate. It was confirmed by the discovery, also on the web, of a rambling personal manifesto in which Roof announced that he hated the sight of the US flag. </p>
<p>The public response was dramatic. After an earnest commemoration of the Civil War that had sought to do equal justice to the narrative traditions of blacks, Confederates, and white Unionists, Roof’s vicious killing spree in the basement of ‘Mother Emanuel’ appeared to demonstrate the inherent danger of acknowledging Confederate memory as the moral equivalent of either its Unionist peer or the newly assertive black counter-memory of slavery and emancipation. Politicians, some of them southern Republicans who had cultivated links with neo-Confederate ‘heritage’ groups like the Sons of Confederate Veterans, lined up to demand an end to the official recognition of Confederate symbols. Governor Nikki Haley of South Carolina backed removal of the Southern Cross flying prominently on the state capitol grounds in Columbia – a call that triggered decisive legislative action in July. </p>
<p>Two weeks before the Rebel flag came down in South Carolina, President Barack Obama traveled to Charleston to deliver a eulogy for Mother Emanuel’s murdered pastor, Rev. Clementa Pinckney. Obama claimed that the recent killings had enabled his compatriots to see that the Confederate battle flag was ‘a reminder of systemic oppression and racial subjugation.’ During the course of his passionate oration in which he sang lines from the antislavery hymn ‘Amazing Grace’ and urged attention to the bigger question of racial injustice, the president threw the weight of his office behind removal of the flag from the grounds of the South Carolina capitol. Hauling it down, he said, ‘would not be an act of political correctness; it would not be an insult to the valor of Confederate soldiers. It would simply be an acknowledgment that the cause for which they fought – the cause of slavery – was wrong – the imposition of Jim Crow after the Civil War, the resistance to civil rights for all people was wrong.’<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>This was a striking statement, coming as it did from a president who had previously tried to foster a non-partisan approach to Civil War commemoration by sending floral tributes to both the Confederate memorial in Arlington Cemetery and the African American Civil War Museum in Washington, DC. It begged a key question: Was the Charleston massacre the final nail in the coffin of the Lost Cause, at least in terms of the official recognition it received at both the national and the state level in the United States?  Sesquicentennial organizers had tried to incorporate black perspectives into their plans without alienating whites who revered the courage and conviction of defeated Confederates. The hostile reaction to Rebel symbols that followed hard upon the dreadful events in Charleston suggested that this consensual approach to the Civil War was no longer acceptable to a majority of Americans. </p>
<p>Notwithstanding the country’s growing intolerance of the Lost Cause in the wake of a particularly heinous hate crime, it seems unlikely that all Confederate symbols will go the way of Columbia’s battle flag. Resistance to their disappearance remains strong in several states of the Deep South including Mississippi, and demand actually increased when several major businesses including Walmart and Amazon announced they would cease trading in Confederate-themed merchandise. But after the Charleston killings the Lost Cause is now definitively lost – devoid of respect in most public and many private circles across the United States. </p>
<p>From the perspective of anti-racism there is much to rejoice about here. However, historians must be attentive to the pitfalls too. If white southerners outside the confines of neo-Confederacy lose their enthusiasm for Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson, how can educators hope to interest them in the history of the Civil War? Will consigning the Lost Cause to the dustbin of American history really help to eradicate individual and institutional racism and improve the desperate condition of many black people in the United States? Does the removal of a Confederate place name or statue necessarily advance the cause of historical understanding? My own view is that modern historians should work to ensure that Americans, white and non-white, do not lose sight of the Lost Cause and its Confederate symbols. When taught effectively in the context of how the Civil War has been commemorated in the United States since 1865, these things can deepen our understanding of their relationship to evolving power relations in the United States. </p>
<p>Like it or not, efforts to impose and maintain white supremacy constitute a leitmotif of American history. One very good way to explain the development and impact of white supremacy is to demonstrate how a statue of Confederate president Jefferson Davis ended up in Congress. Another is to show why so many of the country’s schools and streets were named after Robert E. Lee, perhaps the most dangerous insurgent ever to confront the government and people of the United States. The Sesquicentennial was an eminently worthy venture. It began the important task of disseminating accurate information about the Civil War in the light of the burgeoning scholarship on both that conflict and its checkered career in American memory. As historians we should seek to carry that work through to fruition.</p>

3453			REDISCOVERING CIVIL WAR CLASSICS:<p> The Shattered Dream of Childhood	Rediscovering Civil War Classics	Madden, David			<p>I conceived this column in a dream early one morning and I am writing it soon after. </p><p>In Faulkner's imagination in <i>The Bear</i>, America was an Edenic dream baptized in its childhood in the nightmare of slavery and revolution and finally shattered in the Civil War and Reconstruction. The clearest expressions in literature of the shattering of the dream of innocent childhood are Civil War novels and short stories. </p><p>Through the eyes of a member of the poor white trash class, Mark Twain's <i>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i> depicts antebellum race and class attitudes and practices that set the stage for the Civil War. The word adventures proves ironic as Huck encounters evidence on all levels of society that Human beings can be awful cruel to one another and It was enough to make a body ashamed of the human race. On a raft on the Mississippi, he escapes from bondage to his drunken father and helps Jim escape from slavery; the raft becomes a kind of idyllic refuge from civilization as they encounter one nightmare after another when they need to go ashore and when two of the worst of men invade their raft. </p><p>Huck is told that if he helps a slave escape, he will go to hell. He replies, All right then I will go to hell, as if it couldn't be worse than his adventures ashore and afloat. When he rejects the sivilized life Aunt Sally offers him, he lights out for the Territory ahead of the rest of westering people. That, too, proves cruelly ironic when we call to mind what the rest bring into the West, especially after the Civil War and Reconstruction. We can imagine that Tom Sawyer's temperament could have attracted him to fight on either side; some evidence exists that he ended up hanged. </p><p>One of the starkest depictions of the ugliness of Civil War battle as seen in its immediate aftermath is Ambrose Bierce's short story Chickamauga, a major Western theater battle site. From his usual omniscient point of view, but focused upon a six year old boy's perceptions [mostly misperceptions] of the dead and dying as he wanders over the battlefield, Bierce imagined a symbolic child of the war: he is deaf and dumb, so he slept through the thunder of battle and can never speak of the nightmare to which he awakens. War was a glorious dream of heroism for him until he saw, by the light of a distant fire, a stream suffused with blood into which wounded soldiers had plunged their heads to drink; too weak to raise their heads again, they drowned.  Drawn to the light, he discovers the blazing ruin of a building; he feeds the fire with fallen branches until he impulsively adds his wooden sword. Then he realizes that it is his own house that is burning, and then by that raging fire light he finds the body of his mother who was probably raped by retreating soldiers. àthe long dark hair in tangles and full of clotted blood. The greater part of the forehead was torn away, and from the jagged hole the brain protruded, overflowing the temple, a frothy mass of gray, crowned with clusters of crimson bubblesùthe work of a shell.  </p><p>To Bierce, who had been a very young soldier himself, who survived a bullet that entered his head, swirled around his cranium, exited the other side, the war was a holocaust of ironies and paradoxes that forged an adult supremely cynical. The child moved his little hands, making wild, uncertain gestures. He uttered a series of inarticulate and indescribable criesùsomething between the chattering of an ape and the gobbling of a turkeyùa startling, soulless, unholy sound, the language of a devil. The child was a deaf mute. Then he stood motionless with quivering lips, looking down upon the wreck. Is that passage Bierce's symbolic expression of the gibberish of Reconstruction rhetoric, North and South in origin, and prophetic of our own time, this spacey, spaced out space age, this age also of nature-made hurricanes and man-made after-effects? </p><p>About fifty years after Bierce's story appeared in his collection, <i>In the Midst of Life</i>, William Faulkner's Huck Finn-like novel, <i>The Unvanquished</i> (1938) told the story of two twelve year old boys who grow older, in many ways, during the war,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   a white kid and his friend, a black kid, whose dream life in the edenic wilderness of the Vicksburg region was shattered by what they witnessed. Twain does not let Huck tell us how the horrors he witnessed affected his later life, except by implicationùthat he felt a compulsion to tell his story. When he is an old man, Faulkner's poor white boy tells the story, the most haunting event, the mass exodus of freed slaves who follow the union army; at the river, the soldiers and the boy's own granny beat back the freed blacks, many of whom drown. </p><p>The boys also witness individual acts of cruelty: and then we saw the thing hanging over the middle of the road from a limb. It was an old Negro man, with a rim of white hair and with his bare toes pointing down and his head on one side like he was thinking about something quiet. </p><p>And they watch the transformation of an adolescent young southern belle into an astonishingly aggressive soldier, who then reverts to her status as a southern woman as her kinfolk sivilize her, shucking off the uniform and, in defeat, huddling into a long dress. As a boy and as a man, actively engaged in events, the narrator is witness to both war and reconstruction, during which he kills a man. </p><p>Always, Faulkner makes much of the power of the southern oral storytelling tradition. In <i>Absalom, Absalom</i> (l939), he shows the emasculating effect, post-reconstruction, upon a young southern gentleman of a lifetime of listening to many men like the narrator of <i>The Unvanquished</i> and lost women who keep the flame of the Lost Cause burning in decaying mansions. </p><p>None of these fictive boys who survive immersion, physical and psychological, in the Civil War, the War Between the States, who surrender in old age to a compulsion to tell their stories, express a radical change in their point of view, such as one might well expect from the deaf mute child in Chickamauga, and the various children in Evelyn Scott's myridminded epic <i>The Wave</i> (1929). Other novels in which old men do not show change of heart or mind to any significant degree are <i>The Fathers</i> (1938) by the Fugitive poet and Agrarian Allen Tate and quite recently <i>Nashville: 1861</i> (1997), winner of the first Michl Shaara Award, by Madison Jones. In the first novel, a boy witnesses mistreatment of a black man, and in the second novel, when a white boy and a black boy, friends, plunge into the battle, seeking the white boy's father, the black boy is killed. </p><p>Out of an acute awareness of that pattern in Civil War narrations by old men about their childhood exposures, I conceived a different approach in my own novel <i>Sharpshooter</i> (1996). I worked from the premise of the narrator of <i>The Unvanquished</i> when he says there is a limit to what a child can accept, assimilate. My narrator was first of all a child when he was a sharpshooter; he understood so little of what went on around him in many battles, that he felt later on that he missed the war. He spends the rest of his long life, from war into Reconstruction and on into the Depression, writing his way back into the many horrors of the war only to realize in the end that he had repressed the event that shattered his dream of the war: his shooting, from the guard tower at Andersonville Prison, the Union black soldier who had taught him how to read and write and who had impulsively crossed the deadline, as if to escape. </p><p>His innocent stare into the cross-hairs of his telescopic sharpshooter's lens from the tower high above the battlefield abruptly turns into the soul's shocked awareness, and is symbolic for us of the prolonged, delayed effect of the shattering of the dream of childhood in war. Reading those works of fiction we may imagine the mind set of those children as they grew into adulthood in the real world of reconstruction and became old folks during the depression. </p><p>In all of the above examples, a black child or young black man is a witness living a nightmare already, with a voice in these novels merely implied by what the white witness tells us in old age. </p><p>A witnessing child's innocent stare is a common element in many of the prominent southern novels and short stories set in the depression, a legacy of the war: Faulkner's That Evening Sun, Carson McCullers' <i>The Heart is a Lonely Hunter</i>, Truman Capote's <i>Other Voices, Other Rooms</i>, and Harper Lee's <i>To Kill a Mockingbird </i>. </p><p>In all these novels, by Southern writers and set in the south, the dream is a metaphor of an ideal that is shattered into nightmare from which we are only now beginning to awaken. </p><p>Less known to serious students of the Civil War are the many novels by Northerners as well as Southerners written for children that depict the effect of the war upon children, wrenched out of the ideal dream of antebellum life into the nightmare of war, mostly set in the South, and more prolonged nightmare of Reconstruction. These novels, about 50 each years, often take up issues not dealt with in adult novels. </p><p>A decade ago, the United States Civil War Center created a unique collection of books written for children about the Civil War, which is housed in Hill Memorial, the special collections Library at Louisiana State University. </p><p>In recent issues of Civil War Book Review, see: <a href=http://www.cwbr.com/cgi-bin/dbman/cwbr/cwbr.cgi?db=cwbr&uid=default&Categories=For_Kids&Categories=FKYA&Categories=FKChildren&sb1=11&so1=descend&sb2=3&so2=ascend&view_records=View+Records&nh=4&mh=1><b>How I Found the Strong:A Novel of the Civil War</b></a>, <a href=http://www.cwbr.com/cgi-bin/dbman/cwbr/cwbr.cgi?db=cwbr&uid=default&Categories=For_Kids&Categories=FKYA&Categories=FKChildren&sb1=11&so1=descend&sb2=3&so2=ascend&view_records=View+Records&nh=9&mh=1><b>Cassie's Sweet Berry Pie</b></a>, <a href= http://www.cwbr.com/cgi-bin/dbman/cwbr/cwbr.cgi?db=cwbr&uid=default&Categories=For_Kids&Categories=FKYA&Categories=FKChildren&sb1=11&so1=descend&sb2=3&so2=ascend&view_records=View+Records&nh=13&mh=1><b>Almost To Freedom</b></a>, and <a href= http://www.cwbr.com/cgi-bin/dbman/cwbr/cwbr.cgi?db=cwbr&uid=default&Categories=For_Kids&Categories=FKYA&Categories=FKChildren&sb1=11&so1=descend&sb2=3&so2=ascend&view_records=View+Records&nh=15&mh=1><b>Sarah's Ground</b></a>.</p><p><i>Founding Director of the United States Civil War Center and creator of the Civil War Book Review, David Madden is the author of a Civil War novel, <b>Sharpshooter</b>. </i></p><p><i>His other Civil War books are <b>Classics of Civil War Fiction, Beyond the Battlefield, Thomas Wolfe's Civil War, Losses of the Sultana and Reminiscences of Survivors</b> [introduction].

5931			Civil War Treasures: <br>The Soldier’s Everlasting Rest: Preserving the Dead in Civil War New Orleans		Taylor, Michael			"<p>If you enjoyed HBO’s hit series Six Feet Under, a collection of Civil War letters in the LSU Libraries’ Special Collections might be just for you. </p>

<p>The William R. Bell Papers, dating from 1842 to 1874, provide a snapshot of what it was like to be an undertaker during the Civil War. Born in Scotland, Bell came to New Orleans as a young man in the 1830s and subsequently worked as a livery stable owner, renting out horses and carriages for hire. By 1854, he was also employed as an undertaker, a not uncommon second profession for livery men, who were already needed to transport bodies and mourners to the cemetery. The Civil War presented an additional business opportunity: preserving bodies so they could be transported long distances without posing a health hazard. </p>

<p>Today, we take it for granted that soldiers who die in the service of their country will be returned to their loved ones, and yet before the middle of the nineteenth century, a fallen soldier’s grave was rarely more than a few yards from where he fell. The Civil War was the first conflict in American history in which middle class families were realistically able to demand the same privileges for their dead that had once been reserved for the most prominent individuals. This was made possible by practitioners of an ancient art that had recently been modernized and added to the gallery of nineteenth-century wonders—embalming. </p>

<p>The expenses incurred in embalming, transporting, and recovering a body—perhaps the hardest job of all, as we learn from a letter in the Bell papers written from Morgan City, Louisiana—still meant that officers, even in death, had an advantage over enlisted men, especially when they were Northerners and died in places as far from home as Louisiana.<sup>1</sup> Bell, however, did what he could to help. In one case involving fifty Union soldiers buried a half-day’s journey from New Orleans, for example, he offered to reduce his usual price on account of the friends of the deceased being poor.<sup>2</sup> That said, another letter shows that Bell faced the same problem all businessmen face—the need to be paid. In March 1865, he received a heartbreaking note from an impoverished widow in New York whose husband, a regimental chaplain, had died of malaria in New Orleans, and whose body Bell had been holding for six months while awaiting payment from his regiment, which itself had not been paid for the same period of time. “The loss of my companion has almost killed me,"" the man’s wife wrote, “and then to think I can’t have his body, it will ruin me... O this cruel war, this cruel war"".<sup>3</sup> </p>

<p>Bell’s papers also shed light on the macabre but no less fascinating process of preserving a body in the nineteenth century. Several letters from Dr. Thomas Holmes, the so-called “father of American embalming,"" are included in the collection. Holmes rose to prominence after embalming Abraham Lincoln’s friend Colonel Elmer Ellsworth, the war’s first high-profile casualty. Although his work was certainly important and widely discussed, his letters to Bell reveal his frustrations and failures. Holmes was a leading promoter of arterial embalming, a process pioneered in the late 1700s that involved injecting a preservative fluid into the circulatory system. Still in use today, most undertakers at the time of the Civil War readily saw its advantages over older techniques, which were not only inefficient, but also extraordinarily grotesque: corpses were typically disemboweled and then dried or pickled in alcohol or brine. Often the torso was stuffed with fragrant herbs (balm), the origin of the word <i>embalm</i> (a fact alluded to by Walt Whitman in his Civil War poem <i>Ashes of Soldiers</i>: “Give me to bathe the memories of all soldiers, Shroud them, embalm them... Perfume all! make all wholesome!""). </p>

<p>Despite Holmes’s belief that New Orleans was the best city in the United States for his process, Louisiana was ultimately a disappointment. Two Crescent City undertakers may have taken advantage of the war to get out of the terms of their contract with him, and Bell, who had expressed an interest in his costly equipment, changed his mind after examining a body Holmes had embalmed in New York and sent to New Orleans. It was, according to Bell, “not fit to look at."" A body that he himself had embalmed, on the other hand, still “looked very natural after being dead three months,"" and in another letter, he boasted that he could “do as good a job now as Dr. Holmes ever did.""<sup>4</sup> Although Bell’s technique is unclear, enough details exist in his correspondence to establish that it did not resemble Holmes’s. We know for sure that he used alcohol, but it was probably in the old-fashioned way, for in a letter to his New York supplier of specialty coffins, he complained that they leaked when filled with liquid. Other supplies listed among his correspondence that could have been used in his mortuary include zinc (an ingredient in early embalming fluid), coal oil and petroleum (mentioned by an authority on the substances in 1865 as having been used by embalmers since the days of the pharaohs), and even kauri gum, an exotic tree resin that can be mixed with turpentine to make varnish, one of the more peculiar items in the eighteenth-century embalmer’s toolkit. </p>

<p>Strange and unsettling as they are, Bell’s papers support the study of profoundly important issues in social and cultural history, such as how the Civil War came to be remembered, changing attitudes about death, the rise of Victorian sentimentality, public health, the history of American business, and even immigration (like Bell, most of New Orleans’s undertakers in the mid-nineteenth century were born abroad). To learn more about Bell, Dr. Holmes, and the curious history of pre-modern embalming, see: Michael Taylor, “The Civil War Experiences of a New Orleans Undertaker,"" in <i>Louisiana History</i>, Summer 2014 (vol. 55, no. 3). </p>

5120			CIVIL WAR TREASURES: <br>Chants of Defiance: Music and Mindset in the Civil War		Taylor, Michael			"<p>In 1746, following Bonnie Prince Charlie’s failed attempt to restore the Scottish House of Stuart to the British throne, Parliament passed the Disarming Act. One curious element of this law was the banning of bagpipes. Music, the anxious London legislators had discovered, has a way of stirring the passions, especially in wartime. Taking away the enemy’s music can sometimes be as useful as taking away his weapons.</p>

<p>More than one hundred years later, during the American Civil War, the same scene played out in Union-occupied New Orleans, where people found out that something as simple as “Whistling Dixie"" could get you in trouble with the law. On March 16, 1863, Miss Zoe Campbell recorded in her diary that three women had been arrested a few days earlier for singing the popular Confederate ditty “The Bonnie Blue Flag"" at a house on Carondelet Street, in defiance of a ban put in place a year earlier by General Benjamin “Beast"" Butler against singing the tune. Although the women were released within a few hours, the incident proved that singing was very much regarded as a political statement.<sup>1</sup> </p>

<p>From the war’s outset, Southerners had used music to advance their cause. The scope and variety of this output is remarkable, all the more so considering the fact that, although the South had always been a musical place, little had ever been composed or published there. With the outbreak of war, Southerners found their musical voice and, as historian and bibliographer E. Merton Coulter has written, “There was hardly anyone who was so inhibited as not to feel that he could write a song, either the words or the music, and frequently both.""</p>

<p>Much of this music is now available to researchers in the LSU Libraries’ Special Collections. One anthology in particular, <i>Souvenir of Confederacy</i>, contains many rare Confederate music imprints. The stories behind some of these songs can often give insight into the southern mindset at the time of the Civil War.</p>

<p>For example, although Daniel Emmett’s melody, “Dixie,"" became the Confederacy’s unofficial national anthem, some Southerners disapproved of its burlesque “Yankee"" origins, not to mention its comic lyrics, written in an exaggerated African-American dialect. The Virginia poet Henry Throop Stanton was one of several people who rewrote the words to the song. Instead of longing for a southern homeland, Stanton’s “Dixie War Song"" is a call to arms against a “boasting mad invader"" who sought to “Trample Dixie and degrade her.""</p>

</p>Other songwriters tried to “sell"" the southern cause by identifying it with the nobler elements of the French Revolution. In New Orleans, for example, the composer and publisher A. E. Blackmar (who would soon be arrested for publishing “The Bonnie Blue Flag"") wrote “The Southern Marseillaise,"" with new words to the proud tune of the French national anthem. Some Southerners felt that the war was “the Lord’s work,"" and songs such as “The Southron’s Chaunt of Defiance,"" with music by Blackmar and lyrics by Natchez native Catherine Ann Warfield, draw on imagery from the Bible to portray the struggle between North and South.  “But the battle to the strong is not given, While the judge of right and wrong sits in heaven,"" the aptly named Mrs. Warfield’s lyrics run, “And the God of David still guides the pebble with his will. There are giants yet to kill, wrongs unshriven!""<sup>2</sup> </p>

<p>If music can be divisive and inspire people to acts of violence, it is worth remembering that it can also bring people together in more worthy causes. This is shown by another incident recorded in Zoe Campbell’s diary.  On February 16, 1863, she attended a benefit concert for destitute families at New Orleans’s French Opera House.</p>

6176			Civil War Treasures: <br>A Legacy of Children's Civil War Literature in Words and Pictures: <i>The Michael Lehman Williamson Collection of Civil War Books for Young People</i>		Lacher-Feldman, Jessica			"<p>In 1994, in honor of his son’s passing, B. Lehman Williamson established the <i>Michael Lehman Williamson Collection of Civil War Books for Young People</i>. This collection features books about aspects of the Civil War, published from 1862 to the present.  This collection, with over  900 books about the Civil War written for specifically for children, includes a broad range of genres, including fiction, non-fiction, and biographical profiles. </p>  
<p>In 2002 Hill Memorial Library used a selection from this collection for an exhibit, <i>Blue and Gray for Boys and Girls: An Exhibition of Children’s Civil War Literature</i>.  The exhibit was a project of the then United States Civil War Center, and documentation of that exhibition, including photographs and a bibliography are available at <a href="" http://www.lib.lsu.edu/sites/all/files/sc/exhibits/e-exhibits/chlit/home.htm "">the LSU Libraries website</a>. </p>


 
<p>The collection is significant as a unique body of materials reflecting this particular subject, a focus solely on books geared towards a young audience.  Scholars and students interested in the history of reading, children’s literature, historiography, and a host of other topics would find these materials of particular interest, and those who wish to explore a long range view of representations of the Civil War specifically targeted at young American audiences will find this collection invaluable for that purpose. </p>

<p>While the breadth of the collection is impressive in size, span of decades, and its thoroughness, there is another particular draw which makes the collection important for scholars of a different stripe, specifically those looking at the book as “object” – exploring design, publishing history, and the choices made to market books to intended audiences. </p>

<p>Books from around 1880 through about 1910 are especially important, interesting (and collectible!) because of their design, illustrating how the Civil War was graphically portrayed.  This graphic imagery was presented to young people, as well as the adults who most often purchased these books for children as gifts, or for public or school libraries, and represented not only an interest in the war itself, but reflected an interaction with a time that was still tangible and palpable across the United States.  It is certain that these early readers, just fifteen to forty-five years beyond the end of the Civil War, had a personal connection through a grandparent, parent, neighbor, or teacher who served, was wounded, or perhaps died as a result of the Civil War. </p>


<p>The sometimes vivid, sometimes graphic, and sometimes very serious images are an interesting reflection of how books were marketed to a young audience at a particular time and place.  Heroics, action, romance, nationalism, violence, austerity, and more, all have a place on these covers, and it can be imagined that they didn’t just inspire thought, but they inspired a desire to read. </p>
<p>The historian Jim Cullen points out that most of the American public has been exposed to the Civil War not through academic work but through popular culture. Americans continue to be moved by the romanticism and drama of the era, absorbing the Civil War via motion pictures and television mini-series. During the publishers’ bindings era, roughly 1884 – 1930, the Civil War served as the basis for hundreds of novels, poems, songs, humorous writings, and of course, children’s stories. </p>



<p>Children were, in no doubt, excited and inspired by the content of these  books.  While many are illustrated and have brilliant covers, it is the books of the latter part of the 19th century and the first decade of the 20th century that capture the imagination of not only the reader, but of this librarian, who imagines, in an era before comic books, radio, and television, the hours of fascination, thought, leisure time, and expression that were drawn from these book covers alone. </p>  

<p>It is through the generosity and vision of B. Lehman Williamson, who passed away in September of 2015 that this important collection is available in LSU Libraries Special Collections for scholars and students of all ages.  Mr. Williamson’s gift, and his legacy will live on in this growing collection, as the Civil War continues to fascinate readers of all ages.</p>

6116			Civil War Treasures: <br>Our Fearful Trip: Remembering the Civil War on RMS Titanic		Taylor, Michael			"<p>James Cameron’s 1997 Hollywood blockbuster <i>Titanic</i>, like most historical movies, is fun to watch but doesn’t let the truth get in the way of a good story. Though we will never know for sure, the accents of two real-life passengers probably belong on the list of things the film got wrong. In one scene, Colonel Archibald Gracie, portrayed by Welsh actor Bernard Fox, gives off the air of a pompous British army officer as he dines with fictional lovers Jack and Rose. Later, as the ship is sinking, we hear fellow first-class passenger Isidor Straus speaking with a slight German or Yiddish accent, desperately trying to persuade his wife, Ida, to get into a lifeboat. (One of the film’s most memorable, if inaccurate, scenes shows the elderly couple lying on a bed quietly embracing as water fills their cabin.) </p>

<p>Moviegoers would have had a better sense of who Gracie and Straus really were if the film’s directors had cast actors from below the Mason-Dixon Line. Both passengers, it turns out, were Southerners with vivid memories of the Civil War. </p>

<p>Gracie, born in Mobile, Alabama, in 1859, came from a family of bankers and merchants. Though his family’s roots were in New York (their residence on the Upper East Side is now home to the city’s mayor), the Gracies made their fortune in the South, first in Virginia as tobacco exporters and later in the Cotton Kingdom. Related by marriage to “Old Fuss and Feathers,"" General Winfield Scott—a staunch Unionist despite his Virginia upbringing—Gracie’s father nevertheless fought for the Confederacy as a brigadier general. He was killed in 1864 at the Siege of Petersburg. </p>

<p>The younger Gracie became a military man, too, with a passion for Civil War history. In 1911, he published a nearly 500-page book, <i>The Truth about Chickamauga</i>, a work that took him seven years to complete. Exhausted, Gracie traveled to Europe for a “much-needed rest."" When it came time to return home, he booked passage on an elegant new liner named RMS <i>Titanic</i>. </p>

<p>As the supposedly unsinkable “floating palace"" steamed out into the Atlantic, Gracie browsed its library, finding a copy of Mary Johnston’s <i>Old Dominion</i>, a romance set in colonial Virginia. “While peacefully reading the tales of adventure and accounts of extraordinary escapes therein,"" Gracie later recalled, “how little I thought that in the next few hours I should be a witness and a party to a scene to which this book could furnish no counterpart, and that my own preservation from a watery grave would afford a remarkable illustration of how ofttimes ‘the truth is stranger than fiction.'"" </p>

<p>Meanwhile, another passenger, Isidor Straus, was unwittingly spending the last hours of his life reading Gracie’s own book, <i>The Truth about Chickamauga</i>, loaned to him by the author. The millionaire co-owner of Macy’s department store in Manhattan shared the colonel’s interest in the Civil War and the two swapped anecdotes while lounging in the <i>Titanic</i>’s smoking room over the course of several days. </p>

<p>Born in Germany, Straus had emigrated in 1854, at the age of nine, to rural Talbotton, Georgia, where his father Lazarus had already lived for several years working as an itinerant peddler and shopkeeper. At the outbreak of the Civil War, Isidor tried to enlist in the Confederate army but was turned down because of his age. Abandoning plans to enroll at the Georgia Military Academy, he started a delivery service and discovered he had a knack for making money. After the Strauses were accused of war profiteering along with other merchants, they picked up and moved from Talbotton, where they had been the only Jews in town, to nearby Columbus, a Confederate supply depot and home to a relatively large Jewish community. </p>

<p>Before long, Isidor was helping to raise money for the rebel cause. In 1863, he ran the Union blockade and shipped goods valued at more than two million dollars in today’s money from England back to Georgia. He also traveled to Cuba, where he oversaw the sale of stranded Southern ships. At war’s end, the Strauses left the South and reestablished themselves as china and glassware retailers in New York City. By the 1880s, Isidor and his brother Nathan were partners in Macy’s. They became full owners in 1896. Not forgetting his Georgia ties, however, Isidor did what he could to help struggling Southern businessmen get back on their feet. The South also remained a part of his family’s identity; one of Isidor’s nephews was even named after Robert E. Lee. </p>

<p>Straus and his wife both perished in the icy waters of the North Atlantic. Gracie himself only narrowly escaped, clinging to a rail of the giant ship until its stern plunged beneath the waves and then swimming through floating debris and bodies to a half-submerged canvas lifeboat. Little could he have known as he was putting the finishing touches on <i>The Truth about Chickamauga</i> that his next book, the one for which he is now remembered, would be <i>The Truth about the Titanic</i>. Published in 1913, it is one of the most important first-hand accounts of the disaster. Gracie never saw it in print. Already in failing health, the shock of his ordeal on the Titanic was thought to have caused his death in December 1912, eight months after the ship’s sinking. </p>

<p>Did Gracie ever draw parallels between the <i>Titanic</i> and the Civil War? The analogy isn’t so far-fetched. Both were colossal examples of hubris and flawed planning. Deep social divides come to mind in both instances as well. Gracie could not have known the extent to which the <i>Titanic</i> legend would take on a life of its own, even though no less than four films, including one with a fictional love story, would appear within a year of the sinking. The increasingly sentimental and even touristic view of the Civil War, however, is certainly something he would have known about through countless factual works such as his own, novels, poetry, and at least a dozen Civil War films that had already been produced by 1912 (three times that number had appeared before the decade was out). Though war and tragedy should never be turned into entertainment, it is hardly unique to our own time. </p>

6174			COLUMN: <br>Nonconventional Civil War Fiction		Madden, David			"<p>One of the first and still considered one of the finest major Civil War novels, <i>Miss Ravenel’s Conversion from Secession to Loyalty</i>, appeared as early as 1867, was written by a Yankee officer who was an eyewitness, John William De Forest, and was set more on a Louisiana plantation than on a battlefield. More generally considered the pre-eminent classic is <i>The Red Badge of Courage</i>, published in 1895, by young Stephen Crane, who saw no war, but who saw and filched some passages of violence from De Forest’s novel. </p>
<p>Hundreds of novels, some great, some awful, appeared in the twenty eight years between those two novels and thousands since Crane’s novel, which is less a narrative about the American Civil War than it is about fear, cowardice, and courage in war per se. If those two novels failed Walt Whitman’s, Edmund Wilson’s, and Daniel Aaron’s criteria for the great novel of the Civil War, which for them remained unwritten, they exemplify characteristics of such novels in their choice of predominant locals, the home front and the battle front, and in their being examples of the ironies and paradoxes that pervade the history of the Civil War novel. </p>
<p> As we meditate on this subject, we do well to be mindful of those novels published from the end of the war through the end of the Centennial: MacKinlay Kantor’s <i>Long Remember</i>; Joseph Stanley Pennel's <i>The History of Rome Hanks and Kindred Matters</i>; Evelyn Scott's <i>The Wave</i>; Andrew Lytle’s <i>The Long Night</i>; Margaret Mitchell’s <i>Gone with the Wind</i>; Mary Lee Settle’s <i>Know Nothing</i>; Mary Johnston’s <i>The Long Roll</i> and <i>Cease Firing</i>; Ellen Glasgow’s <i>The Battle-Ground</i>; Ambrose Bierce’s <i>Tales of Soldiers and Civilians (In the Midst of Life) </i>; William Faulkner’s <i>The Unvanquished</i>; and Ross Lockridge, Jr.'s, <i>Raintree County</i>. </p>
<p> Having read hundreds of Civil War novels and reviewed a good number right on up through 2015, I have come to several conclusions that may stimulate thought about the past, the present, and the future of fiction that deals with the war.  I am realizing just now that I can quite safely assert that in all the history of fiction worldwide no distinct body of work resembles the quantity, variety, and perhaps the quality of American Civil War literature in novel, short story, poetry, and drama forms. </p>
<p> Recently, thinking more often of the comparison between the four years of battles and the eight years of Reconstruction, I am convinced that the lasting legacy in many realms of American life makes the latter far more important, so that some of the most meaningful novels will include that era. Civil War historian and novelist, Shelby Foote started my meditations on that subject when he told me at a public event that, “the sins for which American can never atone is slavery and Reconstruction."" With that in mind, we may consider William Faulkner’s <i>Absalom, Absalom! </i> a major novel of the Civil War because it focuses upon ante-bellum causes and Reconstruction effects from the perspective of the 1920’s, even though only a few pages are set on a battlefield. Perhaps not perversely, one may argue that the ante-bellum world of Twain’s <i>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i> presages certain themes of not only the war to come but also its Reconstruction aftermath. In a similar way of thinking, in <i>All the King’s Men</i>, Robert Penn Warren dramatizes and by the technique of implication interprets the war and Reconstruction by placing the long narrative of Cass Mastern’s Civil War trauma in the exact center of the novel, which is set during the Depression. </p>
<p> Southern and northern men and women have provided readers with many perspectives on the war. The Southern novel in general is a well-known literary phenomenon, partly because there is no such thing as a corresponding northern novel per se. That paradox has lured me into thinking that perhaps the historically rooted and complex southern sensibility is likely to have produced so far the most meaningful novels on the war and likely to write the greatest novel yet to come on the American Civil War. From that contention it is not too much further out on a limb to assert that every serious novel written by a southerner is by complex implication about the Civil War and Reconstruction. </p>
<p> In the fifty years since the end of the Centennial, a good many Civil War novels and a relative few Reconstruction novels—“They ain’t romantic,"" said Shelby Foote—have appeared.  Reader response is determined not only by the elements of fiction--character, plot, subject, and theme--but also by technique, whether omniscient or first person point of view and commensurate style, complex or simple. Both southern and northern men and women continue to publish and the home front and the battle front continue to be among the locales, but a major, very encouraging difference between the fiction before about 1980 and the present time is innovation and a greater variety of subjects and themes, which are seen, somewhat to a lesser degree, also in nonfiction.  Creative approaches include reimagining Civil War draft riots, Union espionage undertaken by a Richmond spinster, and opposing sides facing off in a game of newly invented baseball, as well as explorations of the war’s ongoing impact as with a re-enactor who loses himself in the life of a soldier or a legend that Nathan Bedford Forrest’s tactics influenced Erwin Rommel’s Afrika Korps during WWII.  Civil War fiction, of course, can trace its renaissance to Michael Shaara’s 1974 <i>Killer Angels</i>, but the following novels are among the best examples of continually emerging fresh perspectives: Robert H. Fowler’s <i>Jim Mundy</i>, 1977; Richard Slotkin’s <i>The Crater</i>, 1980; Allan Gurganus’ <i>Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All</i>, 1989; Stewart O’Nan’s <i>A Prayer for the Dying</i>, 1999; S. C. Gylanders’s <i>The Better Angels of Our Nature</i>, 2006; Kelby Ouchley’s <i>Iron Branch, A Civil War Tale of a Woman In-Between</i>, 2011; and Jerome Charyn’s <i>I Am Abraham: A Novel Of Lincoln And The Civil War</i>, 2014.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>From 1999 to 2015, the <i>Civil War Book Review</i> has reviewed almost every novel related to the war, 378 to be exact. A copy of each has been added to LSU library, which has a special collection dating from 1955; the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill has a collection of fiction up to 1955. LSU also has the only collection of fiction and nonfiction written for children. </p>
<p>The only award for Civil War novels is the Michael Shaara Award, conceived at the United States Civil War Center in 1997, now at the Civil War Institute in Gettysburg. Because the focus of this piece is on innovative works, which is also the criteria for the Shaara Award, a list of the winners may prove helpful to readers who wish to explore possibilities.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Making predictions about the future of Civil War fiction is riskier than making somewhat outrageous claims, such as a few of the above. But readers are certainly safe in hoping, perhaps expecting, to see works that deal with subjects and themes underdeveloped not only in fiction but in historical works. Among the many lawyers who proudly display histories of the war on their office shelves amidst the law tomes few if any have written novels with lawyers as protagonists caught up in legal issues and events. Readers might welcome more novels by people in the following professions and from the perspectives of protagonists, male and female, who are professionals: doctors, teachers, preachers, geographers, biologists, zoologists, artists, musicians, actors, historians, poets, photographers, psychologists, athletes, engineers, especially bridge builders, financiers, journalists, anthropologists, lawmen, even dentists, optometrists, gravediggers, and novels by and about members of ethnic groups such as blacks, slave or free, Jews, Asians, Europeans. </p>
<p>A survey of Civil War fiction may convince some readers that Walt Whitman, Edmund Wilson, and Daniel Aaron were wrong in their assertions that no one has gotten the American Civil War into a single book, but let us consider that that vast, tangled subject has been thoroughly taken up collectively, a community exploration by southern and northern writers and their readers. </p>
 
<p><i>David Madden’s latest book is </i>The Tangled Web of the Civil War and Reconstruction: Readings and Writings from a novelist’s Perspective<i>. At 83, Madden has published almost 60 books, including </i>Sharpshooter, A Novel of the Civil War<i>.

<p>-----------------------</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>The list of fascinating new themes and authors is too long to do justice, but some approaches that simply cannot go unmentioned are: Civil War draft riots; John Wilkes Booth; travel adventures of a rebellious young woman in Kansas just before the war; a Wisconsin town goes mad, symbolic of war’s aftermath; the making of the Civil War president in his youth; a young Confederate soldier and a young mulatto slave girl experience the war together; Richmond spinster as Union spy; a re-enactor loses himself in the life of a soldier; Union and Confederate soldiers compete in a new game—baseball; a woman dressed as a boy becomes General Sherman’s protégé; a great array of characters and settings during Reconstruction; a unique view of General Nathan Bedford Forrest; a half-Choctaw woman strives to find a wounded soldier in Louisiana; a small secret band of abolitionists in Dallas aid fugitive slaves; a prolific Jewish novelist’s perspective on Lincoln in a fresh style; focus on the crater in the battle of Petersburg; an epic novel before, during, and after the war about an array of characters on both sides, north and south and in the West.  Works deserving credit for this proliferation of themes include: Lawrence Wells’, <i>Rommel and the Rebel</i>, 1986; David Delman’s <i>Ain’t Goin’ to Glory</i>, 1991; David Robertson’s <i>Booth</i>, 1998; Jeff Shaara’s <i>God’s and Generals</i>, 1998; Jane Smiley’s <i>The All-True Travels and Adventures of Lidie Newton</i>, 1998; Thomas Dyja’s <i>Meet John Trow</i>, 2002; Kaye Gibbons’s <i>On the Occasion of My Last Afternoon</i>, 2005; Allen Wier’s <i>Tahano</i>, 2006; E.

5987			CIVIL WAR SESQUICENTENNIAL: <br>A CWBR Retrospective		Isenhower, Zach			"<p>The past few years of the Civil War’s Sesquicentennial have produced a mountain of exciting works that improve our understanding of the United States’ period of deepest crisis.  <i>Civil War Book Review</i> has done its part by keeping our readers up to date on the latest scholarship with our Sesquicentennial series of columns.  Each column, featuring an historian of note discussing themes such as secession, leadership, war in the borderlands, memory, and economics, outlines the state of the field as well as new possibilities for future work.  Our series is not finished yet.  In the Summer issue, Professor Gregory Downs will examine Reconstruction and the legacies of the Civil War.  Yet, as the Sesquicentennial series draws to a close, we offer here all of our columns in one place. </p>
<p>Moving chronologically from the war’s origins, Christopher Childers examines the long debate over whether or not the war constituted an “irrepressible conflict"" in his Summer 2014 column, <a href=""http://www.cwbr.com/index.php?q=5802&field=ID&browse=yes&record=full&searching=yes&Submit=Search"">“The Political Crisis of the 1850s and the Irrepressible Historians.""</a>  Though the election of 1860 represented what Childers calls a “shattering blow"" to Southern hopes for preserving the union, he notes that historians should take care to keep historical contingency in sight.  Willingness for compromise had survived <i>Dred Scott v. Sandford</i>, Bleeding Kansas, and Harper’s Ferry, and indeed lingered even after the first shots erupted. </p>
<p>Taking up the watershed 1860 election year is Randall Miller.  His Winter 2013 column, <a href=""http://www.cwbr.com/index.php?q=5361&field=ID&browse=yes&record=full&searching=yes&Submit=Search"">“The Election(s) of 1860,""</a> outlines Democrats’ inability to overcome sectional discord, Lincoln’s problematic status as “a minority president who gained the Electoral College victory on a regional vote,"" and Republicans’ moves to control national government following secession.  Miller calls for more work on the election in “local terms,"" approaching 1860 not in terms of eventual disunion, but rather in terms of the expectations of voters—North and South—who turned out in record numbers. </p>
<p>Of course, disunion did follow the election of 1860, which Russell McClintock addresses in <a href=""http://www.cwbr.com/index.php?q=4899&field=ID&browse=yes&record=full&searching=yes&Submit=Search"">“Checking the Pulse of Secession Historiography,""</a> from our Summer 2011 issue.  McClintock offers an impressive survey of secession scholarship ranging from Henry Adams to work on the horizon.  Though McClintock sees a remaining need for a comprehensive study of the overall crisis, he finds the prognosis good. </p>
<p>Secession and war a reality by 1861, unionism remained a force in the South, if greatly diminished.  Daniel Crofts’ Fall 2011 column, <a href=""http://www.cwbr.com/index.php?q=4969&field=ID&browse=yes&record=full&searching=yes&Submit=Search"">“Unionism in the Slave States in Wartime,""</a> demonstrates the varied and conflicted nature of Southern Unionism.  Some areas rejected the Confederacy because they were simply close to Union territory and the Federal army.  Still others rejected secession on religious, economic or, despite the Confederacy’s status as a popular white democracy, on political grounds.  Offering a strong argument against historical perceptions of a monolithic South, Crofts also cautions readers against notions that the South was so internally conflicted that it was destined to crumble. </p>
<p>Anticipating the clash of Union and Confederate armies and continuing throughout the war in border states East and West, irregular and guerrilla warfare challenged notions before the war, as well as in memory, of martial romance and gallantry.  Christopher Phillips’ Winter 2015 column, <a href=""http://www.cwbr.com/index.php?q=5929&field=ID&browse=yes&record=full&searching=yes&Submit=Search"">“Unfurling the Black Flag in Civil War History,""</a> offers a fascinating look at what Daniel E. Sutherland called the “desperate side of the Civil War.""  Far from marginal or mere “loose cannons,"" recent scholarship has revealed these fighters as effective practitioners of political violence. Significantly, that violence did not end with the surrender of regular Confederate armies. </p>
<p>With the war underway, commanders on both sides failed to grasp the devastating new technological advances in artillery and rifled musketry, employing outdated tactics that cost thousands of lives, or did they?  In <a href=""http://www.cwbr.com/index.php?q=5436&field=ID&browse=yes&record=full&searching=yes&Submit=Search"">“Strategy, Tactics, and Fighting the Civil War,""</a> from the Spring 2013 issue, Earl Hess highlights important work debunking that stubborn narrative.  Hess calls for a return to the primary sources, so as to avoid repeating overused assertions, reminding readers that military history—properly reinvigorated with primary research—is vital to our understanding of the war as it happened in its own time, not as its tactics appear in the twenty-first century. </p>
<p>As the war wrought changes in tactics, strategy, and soldiers’ experiences, science and medicine struggled to keep pace.  Unsanitary conditions, butcher-like amputations, and a lack of understanding of disease and infection all entered the historiography as hallmarks of Civil War medicine.  Alan Hawk explains a more complex reality of medicine during the war in his Summer 2013 column <a href=""http://www.cwbr.com/index.php?q=5511&field=ID&browse=yes&record=full&searching=yes&Submit=Search"">“Medicine and the Civil War.""</a>  Recent work has demonstrated that although Civil War doctors and surgeons were slow to accept germ theory, they recognized the limitations of their practices and significantly improved rates of survival over the course of the war.  More importantly, their efforts laid the foundation for a systematic approach to medical care by the turn of the twentieth century. </p>
<p>Not to overlook why individual soldiers were in the field implementing the tactics and hazarding hardship, injury, and death, Chandra Manning’s Winter 2012 column, <a href=""http://www.cwbr.com/index.php?q=5040&field=ID&browse=yes&record=full&searching=yes&Submit=Search"">“State of the Field: Where are Union Soldiers Now, and Where in the World Should they Go Next?""</a> surveys the tremendous amount of work done on soldiers’ experiences in the past half-century.  Manning succinctly outlines the debates over soldiers’ ideological motivations (or lack thereof), as well as the roles religion, race, and gender.  Work on the role of African American soldiers, who represented ten percent of the Union army, has made considerable headway.  Manning also notes the need for more scholarship on veterans; something readers will be pleased to find has arrived in time for this issue of <i>CWBR</i>. </p>
<p>Returning to a wider lens, Barbara Hahn engages the argument that the North’s economic and industrial might relative to the agrarian South rendered the eventual outcome of the war all but inevitable.  <a href=""http://www.cwbr.com/index.php?q=5206&field=ID&browse=yes&record=full&searching=yes&Submit=Search"">“Did Economics Dictate the Outcome of the Civil War?""</a> from the Summer 2012 issue, shows just how uncertain such an assertion would have seemed in 1861, or indeed 1864.  A growing body of research illustrates a portrait of two sections equally unprepared for a lengthy war through at least the first two years.  The possibility of European intervention, battlefield results, and the efficacy of naval blockade all shaped the war’s outcome and all represent points of considerable historical contingency.  Despite its disadvantages, “the Confederacy maintained the second largest army in the world for four years of extended warfare over half a million square miles,"" a significant feat hardly characteristic of a rebellion doomed from the start. </p>
<p>Once Southern independence did fail and the war ended however, the Confederacy seemingly only loomed larger in American memory, even as the war grew further removed from the present.  In his Fall 2013 column, <a href=""http://www.cwbr.com/index.php?q=5590&field=ID&browse=yes&record=full&searching=yes&Submit=Search"">“The Lost Cause,""</a> Gaines Foster reviews ongoing and compelling work on the Confederacy’s place in American memory.  Chief among the challenges Foster highlights is that the Lost Cause—often invoked to understand the Southern psyche or in context of white resistance to Civil Rights in the 1960s—exerts less a hold on American imaginations than often thought. </p>
<p>We hope readers will rediscover arguments and titles in these columns that they might have forgotten, or catch up on columns they may have missed.

5867			Civil War Treasures: <br>Hire a Vet: Ex-Confederates Look for Work in the New South		Rasmussen, Hans			"<p>Veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan can turn to entities from the Federal Government to Hire Heroes USA to Spike TV for help in finding jobs in a tough economy, but the problem of unemployment among veterans and the need for assistance is hardly new.  The Bonus Army of unemployed veterans from World War I marched on Washington in 1932 demanding cash-payment redemption of their service certificates, while the post-World War II G.I. Bill was passed to avoid a repeat of that outrage partly by providing unemployment compensation.  A diminutive pamphlet in the LSU Libraries Special Collections illustrates how unemployment cursed veterans of the Civil War as well, and how their fellow comrades came to their aid.</p>
<p>

</p
<p><b><i>List of Applicants for Employment </i>(second edition) </b>is a pamphlet only eight pages long and not 3 x 5 inches in size issued by the Confederate Veterans’ Employment Bureau of New Orleans probably around 1900.<sup>1</sup>  With the nation still mired in the Panic of 1893, the United Confederate Veterans camps in New Orleans organized an employment bureau in November 1895 to aid veterans still able to work or unable to enter the Confederate soldiers’ home because of ties with wives or children.  The bureau requested that camps include, as part of their regular business, calls for names of veterans needing employment and news of any available job opportunities, reporting both to the bureau.  It kicked off its campaign with a published appeal for planters, merchants, and industrialists to “obtain help, and at the same time benefit a worthy class of citizens.”</p>  

<p><blockquote>The claims of these patriotic citizens cannot be disregarded—they are enforced by a record honorable to the State—they are accentuated by a history of bravery and self-sacrifice that has rendered their deeds memorable.  Their exemplary and law-abiding citizenship since the war enhances their soldiery records, and calls for favorable consideration.  They make no appeal for charity; they but ask opportunities for work.<sup>2</sup></blockquote></p>

<p>The Confederate Veterans’ Employment Bureau printed pamphlets like this one to spread the word about veterans down on their luck.  The brochure lists alphabetically the names of veterans seeking employment.  Each entry gives his name, regiment, address, and type of employment sought.  Although most resided in New Orleans, applicants came from across the region.  Nearly all sought working-class occupations, especially as clerks, watchmen, porters, or laborers.  Most entries followed these common patterns:</p>



<p><blockquote>B H Collins, Co H, 7<sup>th</sup> La Vol Inft Hays Brig. 1132 Valmont st.  Watchman, carpenter.</p>

<p>P A McDonald, Co A, St Paul’s Battalion Memorial Hall.  Collector, clerk or watchman.</p>

<p>John Reaney, Priv Co B, 8<sup>th</sup> La Vol Inft 1<sup>st</sup> Brigade, A N Va. 2334 Chippewa st.  Clerk or light labor.</blockquote></p>

<p>Several applicants listed specialized trades like civil engineer, cotton classer, baker, confectioner, railroad conductor, even a man with experience as a pilot on the Atchafalaya River and Bayou Teche.</p>

<p><blockquote>J B Lebas, Co D, 5th La Regt Charenton, La.  Sugar maker and refiner.</p>

<p>M D Fazende, Co F, Orleans Guard. 1916 Felicity st.  Overseer or manager.</blockquote></p>

<p>More were just desperate.</p>

<p><blockquote>Philip Duvernay, Co E, 20th La Regt. 1813 Tulane ave.  Anything.</blockquote></p>

<p>The bureau included names of veterans’ family members when the head of household was unable to work.</p>

<p><blockquote>Miss Mary L. Connelly, daughter of John Connelly, Co B, 14th La.   Any ladies position.</p>

<p>Mrs M E Jones, wife of Capt E Jones, Co K, 17th Va Regt. North street, Vicksburg, Miss. Sales lady.</p>

<p>Julien Porta, son of [C]esare Porta, Co A, 18th La, Army Tenn, [C]amp 2. Central La.  Apprentice or clerk; wants to learn a trade. </blockquote></p>

<p>While the desire for state pensions and soldiers’ homes dominated the lobbying efforts of the United Confederate Veterans—these issues received mention in its appeals for the unemployed as well—the crisis of general unemployment remained a persistent if often overlooked worry among veterans of the Civil War.</p>

4120			CIVIL WAR TREASURES: <br> Lincolniana in the LSU Libraries: Special Collections houses a variety of materials		Jewett, Leah Wood			"LSU Libraries’ Special Collections houses items in several collections pertaining directly, and indirectly, to Abraham Lincoln. The sources listed in this column represent a sampling of the library’s holdings. Researchers can find a complete listing of materials – both manuscript items and publications – by accessing the online catalog at www.lib.lsu.edu using the keywords “Abraham Lincoln.”</p>
<p>
<b>Manuscripts</b></p>
<p>
Among the manuscript collections is a handwritten copy of President Lincoln’s letter of August 5, 1863, to General Nathaniel P. Banks regarding military and political activities in Louisiana. Addressed to Benjamin F. Flanders by Lincoln, the library’s copy is part of the Benjamin F. Flanders Papers, Mss. 671, Louisiana and Lower Mississippi Valley Collections (LLVMVC).</p>
<p> 
In early 1863 Flanders served as congressman for the First Congressional District of Louisiana. General Philip Sheridan appointed him governor of Louisiana in 1867; he later held the office of mayor of New Orleans, among other political positions.</p>

Transcription:</p>
<p>
My dear General Banks</p>
<p>
Being a poor correspondent is the only apology I offer for not having sooner tendered my thanks for your very successful, and very valuable military operations this year. The final stroke in opening the Mississippi<sup>1</sup> never should, and I think never will, be forgotten.</p>
<p>
Recent events in Mexico, I think, render early action in Texas<sup>2</sup> more important than ever. I expect, however, the General-in-Chief, will address you more fully upon this subject.</p>
<p>
Governor Boutwell<sup>3</sup> read me to-day that part of your letter to him, which relates to Louisiana affairs. While I very well know what I would be glad for Louisiana to do, it is quite a different thing for me to assume direction of the matter. I would be glad for her to make a new Constitution recognizing the Emancipation proclamation, and adopting Emancipation in those parts of the state to which the proclamation does not apply. And while she is at it, I think it would not be objectionable for her to adopt some practical system by which the two races could gradually live themselves out of their old relation to each other, and both come out better prepared for the new. Education for young blacks should be included in the plan. After all, the power, or element, of ""contract"" may be sufficient for this probationary period; and, by it’s simplicity, and flexibility, may be the better.</p>
<p> 
As an Anti-Slavery man I have a motive to desire emancipation, which pro-slavery men do not have; but even they have strong Enough reason to thus place themselves again under the shield of the Union; and to thus perpetually hedge against the recurrence of the scenes through which we are now passing.</p>
<p>
Gov. Shepley<sup>4</sup> has informed me that Mr. Durant<sup>5</sup> is now taking a registry, with a view to the Election of a Constitutional Convention in Louisiana. This, to me, appears proper. If such convention were to ask my views, I could present little else than what I now say to you. I think the thing should be pushed forward, so that if possible, its mature work may reach here by the meeting of Congress.</p>
<p>
For my own part I think I shall not, in any event, retract the Emancipation proclamation; nor, as Executive, ever return to slavery any person who is free by the terms of that proclamation, or by any of the acts of Congress.</p>
<p>
If Louisiana shall send members to Congress, their admission to seats will depend, as you know, upon the respective Houses, and not upon the President.</p>
<p>
If these views can be of any advantage in giving shape, and impetus, to action there, I shall be glad for you to use them prudently for that object. Of course you will confer with intelligent and trusty citizens of the State, among whom I would suggest Messrs. Flanders<sup>6</sup>, Hahn<sup>7</sup>, and Durant; and to each of whom I now think I may send copies of this letter. Still it is perhaps better to not make the letter generally public. Yours very truly</p>
<p>
A. Lincoln</p>
<p>
[Endorsed on back]</p>
<p> 
Hon. B. F. Flanders</p>
<p>
The [sic] within is a copy of a letter to Gen. Banks. Please observe my direction to him. Do not mention the paragraph about Mexico.</p>
<p>
A. Lincoln</p>
<p> 
Aug. 6, 1863</p>
<p>

2309			EDITORIAL:<p>The many curiosities of Webb Garrison		Knull, Morgan			"<br>Although a half-century separated us in age, when I was introduced to Webb Garrison, he remained very much in his prime. The author of 50 books, six alone in the past year, his annual output exceeded what some writers produce in a lifetime. When he died in July, at age 81, he still was going steady, having retired to Lake Junaluska, North Carolina, to become, in the words of one book critic, ""a virtual one-man Civil War publishing house.""<p>I never met Webb, but we soon were on a first-name basis. ""I hardly ever use a title of any sort,"" he declared. Ours was, as editorial relationships often are, an association conducted by letter, phone, and the occasional email. We spoke for the final time in June, when I pitched to him the idea of reviewing a book on the 1864 Atlanta campaign, a review that would have appeared in this issue.<p>As a graduate student in sociology and divinity at Emory, Webb was introduced to the work of Bell Wiley, the historian whose <i>Johnny Reb</i> and <i>Billy Yank</i> books influenced a rising generation of historians, Webb among them. It may not have taken much convincing; his birthplace was some 30 miles east of Atlanta. Escaping the wrath of General William T. Sherman's March to the Sea, his hometown of Covington was visited in July 1864 by Union cavalry general Kenner Garrard, who burned public facilities and terrorized the civilians. The raid left a deep impression on his grandmother, who passed lore about it down to Webb. ""Always dressed entirely in black, she was mentally and physically vigorous at age ninety-two,"" Webb wrote of her. ""Over and over, she exulted in telling a small boy how she succeeded in burying 'a side of bacon' so skillfully that marauding Yankees did not find it.""<p>His books were outgrowths of a lifelong curiosity about nearly ever subject. They bore popular titles--a representative sample might include <i>Amazing Women of the Civil War, Creative Minds in Desperate Times, Strange Facts About the Bible</i>, and <i>Love, Lust, and Longing in the White House</i>--and together they sold more than 700,000 copies. Most consisted of anecdotes and sketches, and for a very practical reason. For decades, Webb squirreled away notes and clippings whenever he read something new. Soon he had assembled a trove filled with ""tens of thousands of pages"" that served as the source material for his books on history, etymology, science, religion, and other topics.<p>In at least two respects, Webb anticipated developments in the publishing industry. He recognized the diminished attention span of readers today, and, like any great preacher, he resolved to find a way to connect with them. The result was books filled with short chapters, snappy writing, and memorable details. Secondly, he used oral history as a source, as might any southern boy who first learned about the Civil War at his grandmother's knee. Despite these innovations, Webb should not be mistaken for a Leveller. ""Methods, though important in their own right, must remain subsidiary to principles,"" he maintained. ""There can be no real eloquence without great ideas.""<p>In <i>Atlanta and the War</i>, Webb concludes with a moving chapter about the postwar rebuilding of the city, especially how former Confederates worked alongside Yankee industrialists to attract new investment and factories. He writes that the highlight of the 1881 International Cotton Exposition was Atlanta's decision to invite Sherman to deliver remarks: ""Alone among the cities of the United States, Atlanta transformed its conqueror into a lauded public figure, then welcomed him as though he were a native son."" Like the generous spirit exemplified by Atlanta, Webb Garrison's lifelong passion for history transcended the need either to glorify or to disown the past.<p>"		Summer 2000	2000-06-01	Editorial								"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=61 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/cwbrdefault.jpg"">"						
2306			EDITORIAL: <p>C. Vann Woodward's exceptionalism		Knull, Morgan			"<br>Although the Civil War is a topic that historian C. Vann Woodward directly addressed only in late life, with the publication of <i>Mary Chesnut's Civil War</i> (Yale University Press, $21.00, ISBN 0300029799), it had long proven formative to his historical consciousness.<p>The grandson of an Arkansas Confederate, Woodward's early books dissected Reconstruction and the Populist era, when the patient work of social change progressed only to suffer a backlash that -- according to Woodward's interpretation -- was motivated more by economics than instilled racialism. The subject of his dissertation, <i>Tom Watson, Agrarian Rebel</i> (Oxford University Press, $24.95, ISBN 0195007077), colorfully presented the idiosyncrasies of the period and of Southern history generally, as Watson's early commitment to racial reconciliation gave way to the political efficacy of segregation.<p>The influx of modern capitalism also proved costly. If materialism was not native to the South, it became so with time. ""Southerners did gradually, reluctantly, and sadly conform to the victor's social order,"" Woodward noted in a review -- one of his last -- published in our Summer 1999 issue. As literary critic Lewis P. Simpson has observed, the South may possess too much reverence towards the past and not enough irony. It accommodated plantation economics, industrialization, and now what Woodward derided as the ""Bulldozer Revolution"" by incorporating all into its proud tradition.<p>But Simpson's challenge is not taken up by Woodward. Often described as an ironist, perhaps because his reading of Southern history emphasized discontinuities -- which are examined in an essay collection he tellingly entitled <i>The Burden of Southern History</i> (Louisiana State University Press, $14.95, ISBN 0807118915) -- Woodward actually was a lifelong populist. He insisted, even when in the far reaches of Baltimore and New Haven, that Southernness was implanted in his ""heart and mind."" In the South's privations and failures he discerned a unique endowment that afforded its people a useful antidote to the dominant American progressive tradition. ""I have something of a leaning against the myths of the nation,"" he once confided.<p>A youthful flirtation with the economic determinism of Charles Beard was fleeting. Even when it exacted a price on his early career, Woodward resisted mightily the urge to view history as impersonal. A 1932 visit to Europe is illustrative. After seeing working class neighborhoods in Berlin, he expressed skepticism about the dreary account of a local communist. ""My God, man, they've got electric lights and running water!"" he declared. The sharecropper shacks in his birthplace, Vanndale, Arkansas, did not.<p>Despite an intimidating output of books, articles, and reviews, Woodward was never far removed from the raging social controversies. He contributed historical research -- later published as <i>The Strange Career of Jim Crow</i> (Oxford University Press, $12.95, ISBN 0195018052) -- to the NAACP's <i>Brown</i> brief and at Yale he spearheaded the ""Woodward Report"" that consecrated the university as a free speech haven. Liberal in spirit and politics, Woodward never doubted that the ""clownish charades"" of political correctness and the vulgarity of the quantitative method (""computers abhor ambiguity"") would pass. He so empathized with his discipline that ultimately his historical perspective became timeless. Edmund Burke's assurance is apt: ""Man is foolish but the species is wise."" <i>Requiescat in Pace</i>, Comer Vann Woodward (1908-1999)."

2308			EDITORIAL:<p>Buying and selling the Civil War		Knull, Morgan			"<br>In a paper delivered in April at the 30th annual conference of the Popular Cultural Association, David Madden declared pop culture the medium through which the Civil War is made present in our own day. ""Just as the simple visual image of the Confederate battle flag can focus feelings and attitudes of millions,"" he noted, ""so the multitude of other products of popular culture can keep the Civil War more alive in the emotions, imaginations, and intellects of Americans than any other war.""<p>History cannot interpret itself; that task--one might even say obligation--is left to each generation to contend with, as it strives to connect with the past and to imprint the present. Pop culture offers many points of access to the War: offering average people an entree to reenacting, historical fiction and romances, television and film depictions, and the burgeoning variety of websites devoted to facets of the War. In this issue, we interview John Jakes, whose popular North and South trilogy (and later mini-series) introduced the Civil War's drama to millions of Americans. <p>With uneven degrees of scholarly rigor but a universal passion for the subject, pop culture mediates between historical indifferentism and obscurantism. It is valuable not only for making history accessible, but because it often is what engages the imagination of the young. As Katie Theriot's feature in these pages reveals, more than one Civil War historian was first attracted to the subject through novels and popular histories such as Margaret Mitchell's <i>Gone with the Wind</i> and Bell Wiley's <i>Johnny Reb</i> and <i>Billy Yank</i> books.<p>Beyond sthetic snobbery, objections to pop history include concerns about its tendency to take undue moral and historical license with the facts. <p>Robert Bracken, a retired attorney in Indiana, recently sent me a speech that he delivered in the 1940s while an undergraduate at Wabash College. The text notes in passing that <i>Gone with the Wind</i> had been banned from public school reading lists in Indianapolis because it was deemed ""not suitable for young minds and well bred ladies."" One might observe the same about war itself. Ironically, today <i>Gone with the Wind</i> is more likely to stand accused of romanticizing antebellum life than of corrupting the young. <p>More serious is pop history's penchant for sacrificing historical accuracy in favor of a good plot line. The publicity for Steven Spielberg's <i>Amistad</i> included school kits that represented artful quotes from the script as having been spoken by John Quincy Adams,  leading critics to charge Spielberg with blurring the boundary between fact and fiction. But literalism is language of scholars rather than of consumers. For most folks, Shakespeare's poetic rendering of Henry V's heroic speech at Agincourt offers an  adequate portrayal of the battle's significance. Sometimes art even improves upon the hoary facts of history.<p>There is, of course, no guarantee that history textbooks or newspapers always get the story right, and new technologies such as the Web and print-on-demand publishing only make it easier for factual errors and distortions to enter public circulation. For that reason, the proper posture toward pop culture must be to enjoy its products and pleasures, while maintaining a reasonable commitment to sorting out the factual from the far-fetched. Keeping up with new books on history and public affairs is essential to that process, and in a larger sense to fulfilling the responsibilities of citizenship. Reading <i>Civil War Book Review</i> helps, too.<p>"		Spring 2000	2000-03-01	Editorial								"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=61 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/cwbrdefault.jpg"">"						
2311			EDITORIAL:<p>Book browsing		Knull, Morgan			"<br>It is not difficult to identify serious readers. In their homes, books will enjoy pride of place. They may plan their travels around visiting used bookstores or making a pilgrimage to a famous writer's residence. And they tend to be more introspective than their neighbors, for readers rightly see themselves as participating in a process of intellectual discovery. What passes on television networks as well-crafted ""sound bites,"" we readers are inclined to think of as sentence fragments.<p> Among book publishers and consumers there continues to be much distress about the industry's fate. Most readers could name a favorite local bookstore that went under because of declining sales and rising costs. The declining number of independent booksellers is pinned on easy suspects: megastores, Internet sales, overpricing by publishers, etc. Although competition for retail book sales has certainly increased in recent years, other aspects of book culture seem to be thriving. <p>When browsing in used bookstores, I often make a point of asking the proprietors how the Internet has affected their sales. Almost without exception, I am told in reply that online book databases have opened entirely new markets. One owner in a small Georgia town confessed that online sales around the world now cover his store's rent. In short, everyone benefitsùused bookstore owners, the local communities they serve, and the fellowship of readers who have ready access to out-of-print books.<p>Even the concept of books going out-of-print soon may face extinction. As more publishers digitize their works, print-on-demand technology will make it affordable to produce small print runs in perpetuity. Books could be available in print forever. <p>Readers benefit also from the opportunity to offer their own reviews of books on the Amazon.com Website. ""Every man a book reviewer!"" it seems. And in bookstores, where employee ""hand-selling"" can introduce a deserving but unpublicized work to the public, I notice the proliferation of mini-reviews posted by staff and customers who wish to recommend books to their neighbors. Or, as the case might be, to caution against a book that is factually unreliable or poorly written.  Recently at <i>Civil War Book Review (CWBR)</i>, I corresponded with a reader who took issue with captioning errors in a book that we had covered in a previous issue. Our reviewer had noted some reservations about the book's format, while praising other aspects, so I invited her to join in what became a three-way discussion over email. Such are the technological possibilities when put at the disposal of conscientious readers and reviewers.<p>Yet fresh ideas remain the most essential element in promoting serious reading. Two years ago, <i>CWBR</i> set out to bring serious readers together with the best new and newly reprinted work on the Civil War era. Today, our journal is sold in over 1,000 bookstores, large and small, from coast-to-coast. We offer mail subscriptions, as well, for those who wish to conveniently receive every issue. Our website features the full text of our printed editions, plus search capability, online book purchasing, and the ability for users to email reviews to friends. <p>As we begin a new publishing cycle, you may notice that this issue carries the designation ""Winter 2001,"" even though it is the fourth issue we published during 2000.  To offer greater shelf life to issues, <i>CWBR</i> installments will henceforth carry the forthcoming season's name. While we may be skipping the fall season, I assure you that we'll never skimp on the quality of reviews you read in our pages. <p>"		Winter 2001	2000-12-01	Editorial								"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=61 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/cwbrdefault.jpg"">"						
1178			EDITORIAL:<p>Living with history		Ng, Laura			"<br>Most often when the term ""living history"" is used, it is in reference to reenactments. From my short tenure as editor at Civil War Book Review, I find this definition far too limiting. Instead, I turn to T.S. Eliot who once said, ""The historical sense involves a perception, not only of the pastness of the past, but of its presence."" I think Eliot was on to something. The offerings we bring you in our slick pages-fiction, biographies, revisionist perspectives, and culture manifestations-are all expressions of living history.<br><br>Through fiction we invite history to live in our imagination. This mental existence is multiplied when we share stories with children. And in our pages you will find reviews on the latest offerings in children's Civil War literature. Works like Ann Rinaldi's <i>Girl in Blue</i> (Scholastic Press, ISBN 0439073367, $15.95 hardcover) and Ted Lewin's <i>Red Legs</i> (HarperCollins, ISBN 0688160247, $15.95 hardcover) show that, like the future, history can take on life in the fertile mind of a child.<br><br>Sometimes the connection between the present and past lives is not readily apparent to young eyes. I can remember when I was a child looking through old photo albums with my mother. At the time, it seemed tedious to sit inside on a perfectly sunny afternoon. Now I understand. Reading biographies is like looking at those photos. In them we find the connection between ourselves and those who came before us. Each picture and book creates a real person out of abstract concept. Through uncovering works like<i>The Civil War Diary of a Common Soldier</i> (Louisiana State University Press, ISBN 0807125938, $29.95 hardcover)-see review by William M. Anderson in our upcoming Winter issue-men such as William Wiley come springing to life with a humor, a horror, and a humanity that is all too easily lost in flat statistics. These words grant us a connection that time and death fails to dull.<br><br>Often time allows us to see events with clearer vision. Innovative works that look at strategy, battles, and decisions are not simply asking what could have, would have, or should have unfolded, but how it colors our present. With the blink of a critical eye, compositions like William C. Davis's <i>An Honorable Defeat</i> (Harcourt, ISBN 015005648, $30.00 hardcover) and Robert G. Tanner's <i>Retreat to Victory?</i>(Scholastic Resources Books, ISBN 0842028811, $55.00 hardcover), bring us the pressures and possibilities surrounding some of the most critical choices made concerning the Confederacy. <br> <br>We do history a disservice when we categorize it as purely academic; recall the myth that history inhabits only the dustiest and most neglected of tombs. Happily there is Laurence A. Kreiser Jr., who shows us that history has a life beyond the bookshelf, making merry in the realm of popular culture. This illustrates that even in the most vital, electric, and changing part of our society, history lives. <br><br> Our offerings in this issue are as diverse as the ways in which history exists among us. I could wax poetical at great length about my ever-changing definition of living history, but instead I will close with the wise words of Stephen Spender: ""History is the ship carrying living memories into the future.""

It is with regret, for both parties, that our publishing partnership has been dissolved. <p>As most of our readership is already aware, the slowed economy has not been kind to the <i>Civil War Book Review</i>. Due to financial difficulties, this may be the final print issue. Members of the Review staff, the United States Civil War Center, and Louisiana State University Libraries continue to work hard to pursue avenues that may save our fine publicationùa temporary on-line only venture appears to be a viable optionùbut as of yet our destiny remains unknown. We will continue to keep you updated and to seek your suggestions and assistance with what lies ahead. I would like to thank those of you who have offered financial and professional support. The commitment of reviewers and sub-scribers alike remains the backbone of our endeavor. <p>Throughout these pages you will find the usual collection of battle histories, fictional accounts, memoirs, biographies, and political texts. We are featuring an interview with William Jack Davis, the author or editor of more than 40 Civil War publications. The release of his latest book, <b>The Civil War in Photographs</b> (Carlton Books, ISBN 184226363, $39.95, hardcover) led to an interesting discourse on the creation and development of photojournalism. Randal Allred, professor of language, literature, and cultural studies, offers an insightful analysis of the meditation on war at the core of Kent Gramm's <b>Somebody's Darling</b> (Indiana University Press, ISBN 0253340810, $29.95, hardcover). Margaret Harrison explores the history and mystery found within<b> No Certain Rest</b> (Random House, ISBN 0375503722, $23.95, hard-cover), the latest novel by award-winning journalist, television anchor, and author Jim Lehrer. <p><b>When Slavery Was Called Freedom: Evangelicalism, Proslavery, and the Causes of the Civil War </b>(University of Kentucky Press, ISBN 0813122414, $45.00, hardcover), a study of the theological impacts that shaped Southern perspectives on slave ownership and Providence, is deftly examined by Carolyn Jones, professor of religion and African-American studies. History professor Jason H. Silverman discusses the pedagogical relevancy of the memoir genre in a review of <b>Surviving the Confederacy: Rebellion, Ruin, and RecoveryùRoger and Sara Pryor During the Civil War</b> (Harcourt, ISBN 0151003890, $28.00, hardcover). The latest text from Richard M. McMurry, <b>The Fourth Battle of Winchester: Toward a New Civil War Paradigm</b> (The Kent State University Press, ISBN 087338721X, $9.95, softcover) investigates the role of the West during the war and is assessed here by National Park Service superintendent Dale Phillips. <p>We are proud to present reviews of two recently published children's books. Carolyn P. Yoder, history editor for <i>Highlights</i> magazine, reflects on Mary Garrison's collection of autobiographical slave stories in her book <b>Slaves Who Dared</b> (White Mane Kids, ISBN 1572492724, $19.95, hardcover). And education doctoral candidate and two-time author Julia Rose takes a look at<b> The Spirit and Gilly Bucket </b>(Farrar, Straus and Giroux, ISBN 0374316775, $18.00, hardcover), a coming-of-age tale set against plantation life circa 1859. <p>Because of your unbending support, we have again put together an issue that meets our mission. We will continue to keep you apprised of the future of our publication, and I am eager to receive your letters, calls, or emails regarding any questions, concerns, or suggestions you might have.

2276			EDITORIAL:<p>Homemade history		Knull, Morgan			"<br>The distinguished critic Lewis P. Simpson observes that Southerners tend to be too pious toward the past and not sufficiently ironical toward the successive changes wrought upon their soil. His observation came to mind recently, when our editorial office received a review copy of a tract excoriating ""the Yankee Empire"" and extolling the South's ""special air."" As the overheated rhetoric of the book demonstrates, the air being rhapsodized in gray resembles, if anything, the ""wild gas"" of false liberty that Edmund Burke cautioned against.<p>In the historio-political realm, excessive piety can take many forms. For a southern nationalist, it results in deploring the ""Empire's campaign of economic oppression"" against the South, without considering for a moment that ""Discount City"" got its start in Bentonville, Arkansas. Marxists strip human agency from history, in favor of deterministic theories, just as social scientists do when quantitative analysis evacuates contingency from life. In defense of a currently embattled Cabinet nominee, some have noted that the official's favorite historical figure is Abraham Lincoln, as if that signification is shorthand for political virtue. Or isn't. For one prominent journalist authored a book last year deriding Honest Abe's ""White Dream."" This latter claim led The Lincoln Forum to devote its 2001 essay contest to the question: ""Lincoln: Liberator or Racist?"" <p>But history is far too textured (as any Civil War reenactor literally can attest) to sustain simplifications, no matter how piously they are avowed. Simpson notes that irony came late to the southern literary consciousness, which is surprising given the fertile historical stuff with which it has to work. Self-critical analysis awakens us to the possibility that the same person might be a liberator <i>and</i> a racist. We should not presume that to be the case, but neither should we obscure the many historical examples of discontinuities and incongruities. The task for historian and critic alike is not to embrace moral equivalency, but to be open to reading the past-with all its glories and follies-as it actually happened.<p>Yet we should not overlook the valuable purpose served by those who seek to connect personally with the past. In his famous essay on ""Homemade Esthetics,"" art critic Clement Greenberg argued that perceiving beauty in objects is intuitive. But historical consciousness operates at different level, one that draws its vitality through symbols and rituals-battlefield walks, family albums, folklore. Attending The Lincoln Forum last fall, I lunched one day with two Lincoln reenactors, who exchanged tips on presenting Lincoln to school children. Hours later, a parade of Civil War reenactors marched through Gettysburg. At their best, such rituals seek to re-enchant the past, as a way of conferring dignity to existence, including our own. Historical consciousness is not intuitive, but is cultivated through the telling of fact and myth until they become almost the same.<p>A decade or two after the German sociologist Max Weber pronounced that modernity involves the disenchantment of life, a nationalistic movement in his own country sought, with devastating consequences, to recover the mythology of the past. Fortunately, the ""greatest generation"" rose up in opposition, inspired as it was by a different set of beliefs and memories that had been cultivated by our own mythmaking. Waterloo really was won on Eton's playing fields, as perhaps the Great Wars were at Gettysburg. The past is not always worthy of celebration; it demands our critical engagement and, finally, judgment. Which is to affirm the powerful imagery that history provides, but also our own role in sorting it all out. <p><i><A HREF=""mailto:editor@cwbr.com"">Morgan Knull</a>, Editor</i>"		Spring 2001	2001-03-01	Editorial								"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=61 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/cwbrdefault.jpg"">"

As fall approached, I saw areview published elsewhere that received the book less warmly, suggesting that it fails to acknowledgethe long-term social consequences of slavery. Deceit and defiance may be natural responses to bondage,but what happens when they persist beyond their necessity? This question lately has assumed particularsalience in regard to Russia's bumpy transition to liberal democracy. Like the newly freed slaves,Soviets were reared in circumstances that encouraged-and sometimes necessitated-lawbreaking. It is noeasy task to foster the rule of law or to restore familial harmony and work ethic where they have longbeen absent or suppressed. Such is the inheritance of collective history, which, though not chosen bythem, still profoundly affects individuals.<p>To recognize the courage required to both acknowledge and move beyond the past must not discourage itsundertaking. Were not slaves -- just as the post-serf and post-Soviet Russians -- better off as freedmen? Atlast summer's annual Deep Delta Civil War Symposium, James G. Hollandsworth, author of <i>Pretense ofGlory: The Life of General Nathaniel P. Banks</i> (Louisiana State University Press, $34.95, ISBN0807122939), told of New Hampshire captain Jonathan Johnson, who was stationed in South Louisianaduring the War. Writing home, Johnson described the freedwomen who visited the Union encampment to dowashing. When another soldier asked one of the women if she preferred working on her own to slavery,she replied unhesitatingly: ""I had a great deal rather work hard and be my own mistress, for what Iearn now is my own and I can do with it as I like.""<p><i>Beechers, Stowes, and Yankee Strangers</i> (University Press of Florida, $24.95, ISBN 0813016460),an account of Reconstruction in Florida by John T. Foster, Jr., and Sarah Whitmer Foster, captures adifferent aspect of post-slavery economics. ""Planters also turned to contracting with former slaves toresume work on their farms,"" the authors note. ""Those planters known for being 'cruel' often foundthemselves without laborers."" Not only working conditions improved with the demise of the slaveeconomy; so also did the cause of human dignity. As the Louisiana washerwoman put it: ""I have workedfor a mistress as long as I want to. I want to live by myself.""Even when reviewers cannot agree on a book's purpose, merit, or style, the testimony of those whodirectly experience history speaks for itself."

5739			Editorial: <br> Your Summer Reading List		Frawley, Michael			"<p>
Another academic year is coming to a close and with it my first full year as editor of this review.  It is amazing to see how vibrant scholarship on the Civil War continues to be.  Hundreds of books have passed through this office in the past year adding to and expanding upon our understanding of the Civil War Era.  The reviews, columns, and interview in this issue exemplify the extent of Civil War scholarship.  </p>
<p>
Our first featured review is Michael Kreyling’s <i>A Late Encounter With the Civil War</i>.  This slim volume reviews how the war has been remembered and explored since the end of the conflict.  <i>Confederate Slave Impressment in the Upper South</i>, by Jaime Amanda Martinez explores the relationship between Southerners and the Confederate government over slaves during the war.  The story of Margaret Garner and the horrors of slavery are brought to light in <i> Gendered Resistance: Women, Slavery, and the Legacy of Margaret Garner</i>, edited by Mary E. Frederickson and Delores M. Walters.  The final featured review for this issue reviews General John Bell Hood’s first battle in command after replacing Joseph E. Johnston in <i>The Battle of Peach Tree Creek: Hood’s First Sortie</i>, written by Robert D. Jenkins, Sr.  This issue also features <i>I Am Abraham</i>, a wonderful fictional account of the life of Lincoln by Jerome Charyn.</p>
<p>
Frank Williams’ column this issue, <i>A Look At Lincoln</i>, reviews two recent works on Lincoln’s relationships with important constituencies.  While <i>Civil War Treasures</i> this issue written by Jennifer Mitchell, explores political confrontations along the path that led to the Civil War.  Finally, we have a very interesting interview with Kathryn Shively Meier where we discuss her recent work <i>Nature’s Civil War: Common Soldiers and the Environment in 1862 Virginia</i>.</p>
<p>
Overall, as many of you head for your summer breaks, there are many new and exciting books about a wide range of topics which you can add to your summer reading list based on the reviews, columns, and annotations of this issue.  On a final note, the Civil War Book Review would like to take a moment to wish our editorial assistant Hannah Childress well in her future endeavors as she moves on to bigger and better things.  Her hard work will not be forgotten by those connected to the review.

5593			Editorial: <br> Status of the Profession		Frawley, Michael			"<p>
As I sit here waiting for a panel on the political economy of the South at the SHA in St. Louis I am struck by how diverse and vibrant studies of the Civil War still are especially here in the borderlands.  Even being able to define what the border was during the Civil War era is apparently, as we found out at the first panel of the conference, still up for debate.  Just taking a quick walk through the book exhibit shows how interested scholars and the general public are in the War.  Hundreds of new titles pour out of the various presses and find their way into this Review and onto our bookshelves.  And, if the papers that were presented are any indication the future, Civil War studies are going to be very exciting for a long time.  Just being around so many passionate historians is inspiring.  I encourage anyone who has not attended the Southern Historical Association’s annual meeting to make plans to attend the 2014 in Atlanta.</p>

The featured reviews published in this issue show this diversity.  That is why editing a journal such as this one is so rewarding.  It seems fitting that one of our featured reviews is Matthew Salafia’s <i>Slavery’s Borderland: Freedom and Bondage Along the Ohio River</i>, which works to show how the people who lived along the border between slavery and freedom were more alike than different.  <i>Civil War Dynasty: The Ewing Family of Ohio</i>, by Kenneth J. Heineman, explores various aspects of the war through the lens of one important family.  The last two featured reviews focus on events after the war.  Carole Emberton’s <i>Beyond Redemption: Race, Violence, and the American South</i> after the Civil War explains how violence shaped the post-war United States while Caroline Janney’s <i>Remembering the Civil War: Reunion and the Limits of Reconciliation</i> reviews how memories of the war were shaped and how reconciliation took place in this emotionally charged environment.</p>
<p>
This issue also contains two excellent columns.  The Civil War Sesquicentennial column, by Gaines Foster, explores the Lost Cause and how it is important still today while Michael Taylor’s Civil War Treasures reviews letters of a southern family in England during the war.  I regret that an author interview does not appear in this issue, but please stay tuned for the winter issue for a special interview format that I hope will prove to be very interesting!</p>
<p>
I have to go now as Gavin Wright is about to begin this session on the Political Economy of the South!  Enjoy this issue and get ready for other great issues in the future.</p>

4639			EDITORIAL <br>New Angles and New Topics</br>		Nathan Buman			"<p>
As we approach the Civil War Sesquicentennial, one begins to wonder how we can possibly find anything new to discuss.  It seems as if scholars and the followers of Civil War history have talked endlessly about the war but the books that continue to pour into our office, onto the shelves at book stores across the country, and into the hands of thousands of readers suggests otherwise.  The promising works that continue to appear remind us that one can never completely understand the Civil War and all of its complicated and interwoven aspects fully; that is, again, the case with the Summer 2010 issue of <i>Civil War Book Review</i>.</p>
<p>
I am pleased to announce a new feature for our site.  In recognition of the Sesquicentennial, each quarter we will feature a different image in our editorial that highlights one specific soldier, North or South.  We hope that this serves as a constant reminder of one of the very personal elements of the war as hundreds of thousands of men left their families to fight.  This summer we have chosen a portrait of Private Sampson Altman, Jr., Company C, 29th Regiment Georgia Volunteers, C.S.A.  Private Altman fought in the battle of Shiloh but died of disease on April 23, 1863. </p>  
<p>
The Summer 2010 issue of <i>Civil War Book Review</i> features a nice assortment of both new angles and new topics in Civil War history.  Stephanie McCurry has asked us to; again, examine the notion of Confederate nationalism as we remember that the war disrupted all of society throughout the American South in <i>Confederate Reckoning: Power and Politics in the Civil War South</i>.  The war served as a platform for women and slaves to become political actors, challenging the authority of the central government and McCurry tells this story quite effectively.  Next, Donald Stoker offers the grandest of strategic investigations of the entire war in <i>The Grand Design: Strategy and the U.S. Civil War</i>.  Stoker examines all aspects of the war, blending political and military details very successfully, to assert his belief that the war’s outcome boiled down, primarily, to President Lincoln’s superior strategic plan.  In <i>The Long Shadow of the Civil War: Southern Dissent and its Legacies</i>, Victoria E. Bynum seeks to understand southern society, specifically, those pockets of southern dissent in Texas, North Carolina, and Mississippi where inner civil wars challenged the Confederacy’s success.  Following emancipation and Reconstruction, Bynum details the legacy of these pockets of resistance after the failed attempt at southern independence as dissenters and former Confederates continued to live side-by-side.  Finally, Benjamin Ginsberg, in <i>Moses of South Carolina: A Jewish Scalawag during Radical Reconstruction</i>, looks at one of the more peculiar characters in southern history, Franklin Moses, Jr.  Moses, an ardent supporter of secession who served in the Confederate army as an officer, supported racial equality after the war provides a new lens for understanding the complexity of social relations across the South.</p>
<p>

Kenneth W. Noe was gracious enough to grant <i>Civil War Book Review</i> an interview to discuss his latest book, <i>Reluctant Rebels: The Confederates Who Joined the Army after 1861</i>.  In the book and in the interview, Noe discusses those soldiers who resisted enlistment in the earliest months of the war, instead choosing to enlist for much more personal, localized motives, yet often fought with no less zeal and dedication than their veteran comrades.</p>
<p>  

This summer, Leah Wood Jewett has dug through the archives at Louisiana State University to find a collection of letters in which a prominent Louisiana planter pondered the coming presidential election.  Her findings help us to understand the growing anticipation of the war as Americans looked forward pensively, just as we await the Civil War Sesquicentennial and begin to celebrate our look back at the conflict.</p>
<p>
Since the previous issue, <i>Civil War Book Review</i> has relocated to a new office on the campus of Louisiana State University.  Always a painstaking undertaking, the move was made much easier by the staffs of LSU Libraries and Special Collections; their help is appreciated greatly.  Everything is in order and we look forward to continuing to provide our supportive readers and reviewers with the best publication possible.</p>"		Summer 2010	2010-08-01	Editorial								"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=200 height=232 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/EditorialImageAltman.jpg"">"						
4828			EDITORIAL: <br>The Vitality of Civil War History		Buman, Nathan			"<p>
As we enter deeper into the Civil War Sesquicentennial, we become more fully aware of how little we truly understand about the Civil War and the decades surrounding the four years of conflict.  Thousands of books have attempted to explore and explain countless topics but a clearer and more nuanced understanding of previously trodden subjects remains vital.  The beauty of studying the Civil War (and all of history for that matter) lays in the fact that we are constantly uncovering new questions, just as we begin to answer earlier ones.  Additionally, the answers that we have discovered over the course of the last one 150 years, often leave us unsatisfied, encouraging us to look again, to ask again, and to attempt to re-explain certain aspects of Civil War and Civil War-era history.  The Spring 2011 issue of <i>Civil War Book Review </i>serves as a product of the remaining vitality of Civil War history.</p>
<p>
This quarter, our celebration of the Civil War soldier continues with an image of George Kimbrue, a Private in the 93rd Indiana Infantry, United States Army.  Kimbrue’s tintype provides us with a great opportunity to see the kinds of arms and armaments that Union soldiers carried throughout the Civil War.</p>
<p>
Our first feature review, that exhibits the vitality of re-assessing what we think we know about Civil War-era history, <i>Slavery, Civil War, and Salvation: African American Slaves and Christianity, 1830-1870</i> by Daniel Fountain, challenges long-held beliefs that slaves adopted Christianity with great enthusiasm, suggesting that, only after emancipation, did African Americans flock to Christianity.  In <i>Border War: Fighting over Slaver before the Civil War</i>, Stanley Harrold examines the vital role of the border states in the years leading up to the Civil War, posturing that this middle ground provided the heart of North-South tension and the primary catalyst to civil war, not the expansion of slavery into the western territories.  Next, David Powell tackles the task of criticizing the Confederate cavalry commanders, Nathan Bedford Forrest and Joseph Wheeler, challenging long-held admiration for the leadership and command of these two soldiers in <i>Failure in the Saddle: Nathan Bedford Forrest, Joseph Wheeler, and the Confederate Cavalry in the Chickamauga Campaign</i>.  Seemingly untouchable for many years, Powell takes these two commanders to task by looking at their leadership during the Chickamauga Campaign and providing a valuable example of military scholarship.  Finally, Randall Fuller, in <i>From Battlefields Rising: How the Civil War Transformed American Literature</i>, shows how the Civil War drastically altered the social outlook and personal reflective of many of America’s great literary minds in his excellent study on the ways in which the war experience shaped American literature for many years.</p>
<p>
Anne Marshall’s recent study, <i>Creating a Confederate Kentucky: The Lost Cause and Civil War Memory in a Border State</i>, reminds us, yet again, that we can often understand our present by understanding our past while asking us to re-examine the unique experience of Kentucky during the war that made it a Confederate state without even seceding.  She graciously granted <i>Civil War Book Review</i> with our author interview this quarter during which she discusses many of questions raised by and explained in this book.</p>
<p>
In our Civil War Treasures column this Spring, Leah Wood Jewett provides an example of the political intuitiveness of women on the eve of the Civil War.  While unable to vote, women played an active role in the political discussion, often participating enthusiastically in the conversation surrounding secession.</p>
<p>
Frank Williams, in his Look at Lincoln series, examines the recent work by Richard Lawrence Miller in <i>Lincoln and His World: Volume 3, the Rise to National Prominence, 1843-1853</i>.  Williams suggests that Miller has successfully provided a treasure trove of information, quotations, and analysis of Lincoln on a personal level that we can use to better understand his ascent to the presidency and his years in office.</p>
<p>
<i>Civil War Book Review</i> would like to call our readers’ attention to the Essential Civil War Curriculum, a sesquicentennial project of the Virginia Center for the Civil War Studies.  The new, live website http://www.essentialcivilwarcurriculum.com/ is a wonderful source that features many important resources for educators and anyone with a thirst for Civil War knowledge.  Please take a moment to stop and take a look at their site.</p>
<p>
No contribution remains more vital than the continued support of the LSU Libraries and Special Collections.  Additionally, editorial assistant, reviewers, publishers, technological support team, authors, and countless other individuals help to make <i>Civil War Book Review</i> the best possible product that it can be; this Spring 2011 issue is a testament to that collective effort.  </p>"		Spring 2011	2011-05-01	Editorial								"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=175 height=204 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/Spring2011Editorial.jpg"">"						
4397			EDITORIAL: <BR> The Real Civil War		Buman, Nathan			"<p>
Growing up as a young boy in Iowa and fascinated with history, I learned the simple version of the American Civil War.  Additionally, I learned what I knew from a northern perspective.  Not until I read fictional stories: Patricia Beatty’s <i>Turn Homeward Hannalee </i>(1984) and Harold Keith’s <i>Rifles for Watie </i>(1957) in the fifth and sixth grade respectively did I begin to question and explore the complexity of the American Civil War.  There began my desire to become a historian; my interest in learning more about our past; my aspiration to spread what I discovered with others around me.  One of my professors once asked his Civil War history class “what, in your life, would make you rise up and charge through Miller’s Cornfield at the Battle of Antietam into a hail of bullets?""  That simple question had a tremendous effect on my desire to understand the real motives and human emotion behind historical events.  I believe these questions enrich our sense of the past and the sense we possess of ourselves.  </p>
<p>

In this, the Fall 2009 issue of <i>Civil War Book Review</i>, we have an excellent sample of recent works that help us to understand the complexity, ideology, and raw emotion behind the four long years of Civil War.  We begin our feature reviews with Earl J. Hess’s <i>In the Trenches at Petersburg </i>as he seeks to examine the influence of field fortifications on the outcome of the Petersburg Campaign and, ultimately, the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia.  Recently, many prominent scholars have collaborated to examine overarching themes that guide our approach to how we study the Civil War and how contemporary Americans experienced the war.  <i>In the Cause of Liberty</i>, edited by William J. Cooper, Jr. and John M. McCardell, Jr., contains perspectives from northern whites and southern whites and northern and southern blacks to better understand secession and the war experience.  Joan Waugh and Gary W. Gallagher have collected essays in <i>Wars within a War</i> that explore the internal tensions that challenged Americans during and after the war, while LeeAnn Whites and Alecia P. Long’s <i>Occupied Women </i>improves greatly our sense of the experience of women in the war who suffered from entirely unique challenges.  Finally, in <i>Fathers of Conscience</i>, Bernie D. Jones explores the issue of mixed-race inheritance that challenged southern whites during the antebellum period.</p
<p>

Richard Slotkin graciously granted <i>Civil War Book Review</i> an interview to discuss his most recent work, <i>No Quarter</i>, an exciting new look at the issue of race through the lens of the Battle of the Crater.</p>
<p>
Leah Wood Jewett has written a wonderful column to complement our look at the real Civil War as contemporary Americans experienced the trials and tribulations of conflict as we head into the holiday season, keeping in mind those families torn apart by previous wars and those separated by conflict today. </p>
<p>

I am proud and honored to assume the responsibilities as editor of <i>Civil War Book Review </i>and I look forward to sharing the new scholarship, perhaps occasionally reflecting on the old as well. I look forward to working with the folks in Special Collections at Louisiana State University and scholars around the world as we all seek a better understanding of a defining period in American history.  I would also like to thank graciously the previous editor, Christopher Childers, whom I have had at my disposal throughout the process of putting together my first issue.  I only hope to uphold the strong standard for which he has set the precedent.    </p>"		Fall 2009	2009-11-01	Editorial								"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=61 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/cwbrdefault.jpg"">"						
4482			EDITORIAL <br> Breaking New Ground in Civil War Studies		Buman, Nathan			"<p>
Historians of the antebellum, Civil War, and Reconstruction periods often face the task finding new approaches in their studies because of the thriving popularity of these areas throughout the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.  Scholars have discussed many topics thoroughly but, due to the constantly changing methodologies and evolution of the profession, new ground always remains.  Ground-breaking scholarship succeeds in finding new avenues to discuss previously trodden subjects or uncovering new episodes of history altogether.</p>  
<p>
This, the Winter 2010 issue of <i>Civil War Book Review</i>, features exceptional scholarship that breaks ground in many different areas of specialization.  In many ways, they look at topics that previous scholars have examined but they achieve new and promising heights through unique conclusions and a careful reinterpretation of the source material.  Our first feature, Brian Schoen’s <i>The Fragile Fabric of Union</i>  considers the dominant role that “King Cotton"" played in the increasing sectional thinking and budding nationalism throughout the antebellum period, culminating in secession and the American Civil War.  Next, David Work explores the role that politically appointed generals played in solidifying Lincoln’s presidency as he sought to build a national coalition to fight and win the war in <i>Lincoln’s Political Generals</i>.  William L. Shea, prominent Civil War campaign historian, illustrates the importance of the Prairie Grove Campaign in effectively eliminating Confederate hope west of the Mississippi River.   Based on daunting research and deft analysis, Shea shows readers, in great detail throughout <i>Fields of Blood</i>, the tactical maneuvers of the campaign.  In our last feature, Barbara Brooks Tomblin turns the readers’ attention to the role that African Americans played in fighting the Civil War while projecting a broader message about what the war meant to African Americans who fought and died for their own freedom.  <i>Bluejackets & Contrabands</i> will serve as an excellent bridge between the struggle for emancipation and the end of slavery during the war and the battle for civil rights and equality after the war. </p>    
<p>
<i>Civil War Book Review</i> is proud and honored to share an interview with Lacy K. Ford, Jr. who discussed with us, his latest book <i>Deliver Us from Evil: The Question of Slavery in the Old South</i>.  He graciously took time to explore some of the highlights and themes of his book in which he breaks down the idea of a monolithic South in unanimous support of slavery, breaking ground en route to showing a more complex and evolving region. </p>  
<p>
In her column, Leah Wood Jewett has kindly shared some of the prized possessions of the Special Collections at Louisiana State University to illustrate and narrate the connection between our university and the American Civil War. </p>     
<p>
This quarter, we are blessed to feature an excellent and insightful column, written by Frank J. Williams, that explores the question of Lincoln and the Emancipation Proclamation, providing his own analysis and using William Blair and Karen Fisher Younger’s recent collection of essays as a backdrop.  The proclamation, Williams suggests is very complex and provides many opportunities for historians to consider or re-consider Lincoln’s politics, civil rights, and the meaning of the American Civil War to the American memory. </p>  
<p>
Again, I would like to thank the Special Collections Department and the staff at Louisiana State University for helping me to bring this issue to fruition.  I believe we have a very strong Winter 2010 issue of <i>Civil War Book Review</i> that speaks to the evolving studies of the antebellum, Civil War, and Reconstruction periods.  It certainly is a treat, an honor, and a privilege to be able to share in this discussion with our readers. </p>"		Winter 2010	2010-02-01	Editorial								"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=61 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/cwbrdefault.jpg"">"						
4248			EDITORIAL:<br>Reassessing Lincoln and the Civil War Era		Childers, Christopher			"<p>
In this issue of <i>CWBR</i>, we continue our celebration of the bicentennial of Abraham Lincoln’s birth.  The bicentennial year has prompted scores of historians to reassess the life of the sixteenth president, the world he lived in, and the nation he reshaped over the course of his presidential administration.  The efforts of scholars to once again “get right with Lincoln""—as historian David Herbert Donald so colorfully put it—in turn prompts their readers to reassess what they know and believe about Lincoln.  Writers always hope that their work will provoke thought and foster dialogue.  And in this year, when we celebrate the bicentennial of Lincoln’s birth, and as we approach the sesquicentennial of the Civil War, what better time is there to revisit what we believe we know about Lincoln and the Civil War era?</p>
<p>
Lincoln scholar Frank Williams gives our readers an excellent précis of the latest Lincoln scholarship in his column “Abraham Lincoln at 200: A Bicentennial Survey.""  And Eric Foner’s new edited collection of essays on Lincoln provides fresh answers to many questions old and new about the man from Illinois.  Chris Meyers reviews Our Lincoln: New Perspectives on Lincoln and His World.  Finally, our <i>CWBR</i> Author Interview features Paul D. Escott of Wake Forest University, whose new book <i>“What Shall We Do with the Negro?"": Lincoln, White Racism, and Civil War America</i> reassesses the president’s conflicting feelings about race and slavery and the tragic persistence of racism after the Civil War.</p>
<p>
This issue also contains reviews of some significant new releases.  The University of North Carolina Press has launched its new series “The Littlefield History of the Civil War Era"" with Elizabeth R. Varon’s <i>Disunion!: The Coming of the American Civil War, 1789-1859</i>.  Manisha Sinha reviews this title, the first of a projected fifteen books encompassing the history of the Civil War era.  And Susannah J. Ural reviews Joseph T. Glatthaar’s <i>General Lee’s Army: From Victory to Collapse</i>, a massive reassessment of the Confederacy’s greatest general and his army.</p>
<p>
Civil War naval warfare has recently received the attention of several prominent scholars.  Tom Chaffin’s <i>The H.L. Hunley: The Secret Hope of the Confederacy</i> probes the history of the famous Confederate submarine, from its conceptualization to its untimely demise.  Steven Ramold reviews Chaffin’s latest book.  And Craig L. Symonds, a veteran naval historian, examines how Abraham Lincoln managed and used his navy in <i>Lincoln and His Admirals</i>.  Kurt Hackemer reviews this new release.</p>
<p>
Our latest issue features a broad array of books that cover most all the facets of Civil War studies, a timely reminder that even in this year of Lincoln, historians and scholars are hard at work finding new stories to tell and new explanations for old questions.   As always, enjoy studying the rich history of the Civil War era.</p>"		Spring 2009	2009-05-01	Editorial								"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=61 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/cwbrdefault.jpg"">"						
5438			Editorial: <br> The Mountain Continues to Grow		Frawley, Michael			"<p>
Intellectually, I understood that a large number of books were published about the Civil War every year.  I also realized that with this being the sesquicentennial of the conflict, even more books were being released now.  But, now that I have taken over the editorship of the <i>Civil War Book Review </i>and I have seen the piles of books being published about the conflict still filling my office, it is staggering.  This avalanche of scholarship shows just how vital research into the war is, and this issue of the <i>Review</i> displays this in wonderful detail.  From new looks at many traditional military and political aspects of the war, to new topics that are just now coming to light, the scholarship of the Civil War period has never been better or more varied. </p>
<p> 
Gretchen Long’s new work, <i>Doctoring Freedom: The Politics of African American Medical Care in Slavery and Emancipation</i>,  is the subject of this issues Author Interview, and is a perfect example of how new subjects are constantly being explored.  Dr. Long’s work delves into an area of that has not been well studied, the importance of medical care as an expression of freedom and independence for slaves and freedmen before, during, and after the war.</p>
<p>
Our featured reviews this issue cover a wide variety of traditional and non-traditional aspects of the period, blazing new trails to future study.  Caleb Smith’s, <i>The Oracle and the Curse: A Poetics of Justice from the Revolution to the Civil War</i>, explores how trials and legal writings effected other forms of literature and popular culture, giving a unique look at the time leading up to the Civil War. <i> The Best Station of them All: The Savannah Squadron, 1861-1865</i>, by Maurice Mellon, looks at a neglected part of naval history, individual squadron histories of the Confederate Navy.  Harry Laver takes a new look at Ulysses S. Grant to show how he grew as a leader from his earliest days in the Army to Appomattox in <i>The Leadership of Ulysses S. Grant: A General Who Will Fight</i>.  Finally is a volume that explores the impact of T. Harry Williams, the eminent historian of the war who not only was a great scholar, but a great teacher, in, <i>Lee and His Generals: Essays in Honor of T. Harry Williams</i>, edited by Lawrence Lee Hewitt and Thomas E. Schott. </p>
<p>
Beyond the reviews featured this issue, Michael Taylor continues his excellent column of <i>Civil War Treasures</i>, focusing on how Southerners filled the gaps in education without access to northern book publishers.  While the <i>Sesquicentennial Column</i> features a review of the current standing of the military history of the Civil War by Earl Hess, an expert in the field.</p>
<p>
As I take over the <i>Review</i> I would be remiss if I did not thank all of the authors, publishers, and reviewers that make a publication like this possible and highly enjoyable to work at.

4567			EDITORIAL <br>Political History Remains Vibrant		Buman, Nathan			"<p>
Long have historians studied history by examining the political actors and politics of those involved.  In recent decades scholars have begun to focus their attention on social, economic, and cultural history yet political history continues to thrive.  Political history remains a vibrant and viable lens through which to view past events, especially the American Civil War.  Those political actors who guided the United States during the antebellum period, through the Civil War and into the Reconstruction period influenced the course of events immensely.  </p>
<p>

The Spring 2010 issue of <i>Civil War Book Review</i> focuses heavily on the politics of the period.  The newest addition to Louisiana State University Press’s Southern Biography Series, Sam Davis Elliott’s <i>Isham G. Harris of Tennessee: Confederate Governor and United States Senator</i>, focuses our attention on one of the key figures of the period’s political activity.  Harris provides a look into the political world of the Civil War era as Elliot gives an account of his senatorial and gubernatorial experience in the often-disjointed state of Tennessee.  Next, Stephen C. Neff details the legal issues that arose from the Civil War as he studies the lawfulness of many of the political decisions including secession, executive powers, and more in <i>Justice in Blue and Gray: A Legal History of the Civil War</i>.  Howard Jones’s new synthesis, <i>Blue & Gray Diplomacy: A History of Union and Confederate Foreign Relations</i> provides a masterful account of the diplomatic relations between the northern and southern governments and the European powers, especially Great Britain and France.  His study illustrates, at its best, the value of understanding political history as Jones gives an account of the actors who maintained a constant conversation with foreign powers about the possibility of intervention in the American conflict.  Finally, eminent historian, Michael Perman provides a sweeping survey of southern politics.  His most recent work, <i>Pursuit of Unity: A Political History of the American South</i>, take readers on a journey, narrating the political history of the American South from 1800 through the present-day political environment. </p>
<p>

<i>Civil War Book Review</i> would like to thank Professor Christian G. Samito for taking the time to discuss his recent book, <i>Becoming American under Fire: Irish Americans, African Americans, and the Politics of Citizenship during the Civil War Era</i>.  In this, well-researched and well-argued study, Professor Samito raises a great number of significant questions about citizenship during the Civil War era.  He graciously spoke with <i>Civil War Book Review</i> about some of the issues that arise out of his book as Irish Americans and African Americans sought to become a part of the United States, taking an active role in the politics of this nation. </p>
<p>

This quarter, Leah Wood Jewett provides an account of some Louisianan planters’ views on the question of secession.  Their political course, dictated by the election of Abraham Lincoln, changed significantly over the months preceding secession of the state of Louisiana and Jewett has provided first-hand accounts that help us to explore and understand the complexity of the political world that these Louisianans occupied. </p>
<p>

I am pleased to be able to feature a wonderful piece in which Frank J. Williams uses Grant Havers’s recent work, <i> Lincoln and the Politics of Christian Love</i> to examine the intersection between Christianity and Abraham Lincoln’s political actions.  Williams has, yet again, provided an insightful piece of writing that uses a recent historical study of the Civil War era to reflect on our lives today. </p>

Lastly, <i>Civil War Book Review</i> regrets that an error was made in a Winter 2010 review of Brian McGinty’s <i>John Brown’s Trial</i>.  We would like to retract the criticism of Mr. McGinty for his usage of “Harper’s Ferry"" in Jeannine Marie DeLombard’s review; the review incorrectly neglected to take into account the endnote in which Mr. McGinty details his usage over the more common “Harpers Ferry.""    </p>"		Spring 2010	2010-05-01	Editorial								"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=61 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/cwbrdefault.jpg"">"						
5123			EDITORIAL: <br> The More We Know, The Less We Understand					"<p>
The series of public service announcements, <i>The More You Know</i>, stresses the importance of education and the benefits of involving oneself in the education of themselves, our children, and any of those around us who will possibly listen.  It provides excellent advice and Civil War scholars have, for generations, ascribed to this concept, never failing to push new questions about myriad aspects of the Civil War.  Sometimes, when we look out from the mountaintop of the Civil War scholarship to date, we realize the extraordinary vastness of this topic and the innumerable directions in which the investigation can continue in the future.  As I have suggested previously, the more questions we ask of our historical studies, the more questions we seem to uncover; it seems as if the best studies leave us with more fresh questions than we have answers from the work itself.  Fortunately, this trend means that Civil War studies are alive and well.  We cannot see even a hint of slowing down on the horizon and our interest in the period and a (perhaps unachievable, yet legitimate) goal of understanding the war and those who lived through the mid-nineteenth century remains vibrant.  The featured works from this, the Spring 2012 issue of <i>Civil War Book Review</i>, highlight the success of scholarship to date, and the promise of the future.</p>

Charity Carney’s <i>Ministers and Masters: Methodism, Manhood, and Honor in the Old South</i> focuses on the role that Methodist preachers played in the construction of southern honor, revealing that they faced difficult challenges and unique contradictions in seeking to carve out their living in the antebellum South.  <i>Shifting Grounds: Nationalism & the American South, 1848-1865</i>, by Paul Quigley, explores the concept of nationalism for southerners during this period.  How could Southerners carve out an independent nation under the pretext of ardent nationalism, Quigley asks, and what did this term mean to them in the first place?  On the other side of that very same coin, Mark E. Neely Jr. explores Constitutionalism and Abraham Lincoln’s interpretation of this document in <i>Lincoln and the Triumph of the Nation: Constitutional Conflict in the American Civil War</i>.  In this challenging and insightful book, Neely reminds us that “the Constitution sits at the boundary between patriotism and nationalism,"" and he shows us the complexity of that statement, to Americans, North and South, during the Civil War years.  Finally, Albert Castel and Brooks D. Simpson explore northern strategy and leaders in <i>Victors in Blue: How Union Generals Fought the Confederates, Battled Each Other, and Won the Civil War</i>.  Castel and Simpson delve into the study of northern leadership to better understand the leadership that finally tipped the balance in the North’s favor as the Civil War progressed, stressing the inter-personal relationships of northern commanders and their role in victory for the Union.</p>
<p>
Nicole Etcheson, author of the Avery O. Craven Award-winning <i>A Generation at War: The Civil War Era in a Northern Community</i>, spoke with Civil War Book Review about her complex analysis of Putnam County, Indiana.  She very successfully uses a single county in a northern state to illustrate how the Civil War provided a watershed moment for a small community as it sought to navigate through the difficult years and cope with the reality of the national struggle while seeking to make sense of the conflict that it had endured.</p>

We truly value Frank J. Williams’s contribution to this issue which focuses on two recent publications by Southern Illinois University Press, Kenneth J.

In this piece, Williams uses these works to analyze the relationships between Abraham Lincoln and those around him in order to better understand Lincoln, the person. </p>
<p>
Michael Taylor, our Special Collections columnist, has provided a very interesting piece that highlights the role of music and written word played as the Civil War generation dealt with the war.  <i>Civil War Book Review </i>thanks all of those reviewers, writers, and readers who have contributed to this and all issues.  The entire community continues to mean a great deal to the success of this scholarly journal as we seek a better understanding of the Civil War period. </p>"	Buman, Nathan	Spring 2012	2012-05-01	Editorial								"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=250 height=291 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/EditorialImageSpring2012.jpg"">"						
5515			Editorial: <br> What We Teach		Frawley, Michael			"<p>
This is a very exciting time for Civil War historians.  The sesquicentennial of the Battles of Gettysburg and Vicksburg has just passed.  A great deal of new and interesting work has been published about the Civil War because of these new events.  Living history, new books such as those featured and reviewed here, and other, newer ways of presenting information have all come out very recently.  One example of this is the Smithsonian’s new look at Gettysburg using interactive GIS maps.<sup>1</sup>  Taken altogether, our understanding of the Civil War has never been better.</p>
<p>
Now, as many of us turn our attention to the upcoming school year, we must find ways to integrate these new ideas into our traditional teaching about the war, and the <i>Civil War Book Review</i> is here to help.  The books featured in this issue look at many new or forgotten parts of the war.  Gretchen Long, who graciously granted the Review a wonderful interview last issue, is the author of the first featured book, <i>Doctoring Freedom: The Politics of African American Medical Care in Slavery and Emancipation</i>.  As discussed in the interview, this book examines medical care as a vehicle for African American advancement and citizenship.  <i>River of Dark Dreams: Slavery and Empire in the Cotton Kingdom</i>, Walter Johnson’s new work, explores the role of slavery in the expansion and development of the United States, ultimately leading to war.  Bruce Levine delves into the upheaval in the South, and beyond, in the aftermath of the war in his book <i>The Fall of the House of Dixie: The Civil War and the Social Revolution that Transformed the South</i>.  Finally, it seems appropriate after the recent remembrance events that took place at Gettysburg, to take a new look at the leader of the Union army who won the battle, which Tom Huntington does so well in his recent work, <i>Searching for George Gordon Meade.</i></p>
<p>
Stephen Kantrowitz is the subject of this issues author interview.  We talked in detail about this recent work <i>More than Freedom: Fighting for Black Citizenship in a White Republic</i>, a must read for anyone interested in the successes and failures of African Americans as they worked to carve out a place for themselves in the American republic.  Finally, Frank Williams column, A Look A Lincoln, returns with a discussion of Benjamin Franklin Cooling III’s new work, <i>The Day Lincoln was Almost Shot: The Fort Stevens Story.</i></p>
<p>
Taken altogether, I hope, that these reviews, interviews, and columns will help readers to expand their understanding of the Civil War while providing them with new ideas that they can take to the classroom, battlefield parks, and speaking engagements and help us to inspire a new generation of Americans as to the importance of this period in our history.<sup>2</sup></p>

4757			EDITORIAL <br>Changing People Over Time and Making History</br>		Buman, Nathan			"<p>
We often study history so that we can better understand ourselves, so that we can understand how events have influenced the decisions of people and society throughout our past.  Every day people around the world make choices that will alter the course of history and that fact has always remained the case.  That idea, that sense of choice and change over time and the ways in which events and our decisions affect Americans was no more paramount than during the Civil War and the decades before and after the four years of conflict.  This, the Winter 2011 issue of <i>Civil War Book Review</i> features works that illustrate how people have changed over time and how they have tackled important decisions that altered the course of history.  </p>
<p>
Our feature soldier for this issue of our Civil War Sesquicentennial remembrance is Private William S. Askew, Company A, (Newman Guards) 1st Georgia Infantry.  The age of this young soldier remains unknown but shows, clearly, one of those historical actors who fought during and helped to shape the course of the Civil War.</p>
<p>
Our feature reviews, which illustrate change over time and the ways in which people made decisions that altered the course of history, include Steven Lubet’s <i>Fugitive Justice: Runaways, Rescuers, and Slavery on Trial</i>.  Lubet provides a fine study of the decade preceding the Civil War by looking at three fugitive slave trials that demonstrate the growing sectional conflict between North and South.  Next Shearer Davis Bowman (a reminder of our own mortality), in <i>At the Precipice: Americans North and South during the Secession Crisis</i>, provides a synthesis of the scholarship concerning the secession crisis, the moment when the tumultuous 1850s boiled over into secession and a final step toward war.  In <i>Topsy-Turvy: How the Civil War Turned the World Upside Down for Southern Children</i> Anya Jabour shows us how the war affected southern children, both white and black, as conflict forced them to make choices to face an increasingly changing world while coming to grips with a new social environment.  Finally, Ronald S. Butchart demonstrates how recently freed people coped with their new freedom and sought social equality through education in <i>Schooling the Freed People: Teaching, Learning, and the Struggle for Black Freedom, 1861-1876</i>.  In this important study, Butchart navigates the choices that freed people made in an effort to gain access to education and gives us a better understanding of how they embraced and approached their radically-changing world.</p>
<p>
George Rable, author of <i>God’s Chosen Peoples: A Religious History of the American Civil War</i>, graciously granted Civil War Book Review a very fine and insightful interview in which we discuss his book.  Rable’s most recent contribution to Civil War scholarship examines the role of religion during the Civil War as both northerners and southerners, white and black, coped with the massive destruction and changing world.  His text will most likely serve as an influential and vital source for understanding the religion during the Civil War years.</p>
<p>
This Winter, Leah Wood Jewett provides a look into the memory of a young Confederate girl.  A resident of Louisiana, Sarah Morgan Dawson, provides us with a window through which to look at how the war affected society, especially those at home.  Her remembrances show how a young girl interpreted and reacted to the war all around her as slaves enjoyed emancipation, the Union army advanced and southern society turned seemingly upside down.  </p>
<p>
I would like to thank, once again, the staff at LSU Libraries, and Special Collections for their help and support.  They continue to support <i>Civil War Book Review</i> endlessly and their assistance helps us to deliver the best product available.  Without them, the Winter 2011 issue simply could not have happened.</p>"		Winter 2011	2011-02-01	Editorial								"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=175 height=204 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/EditorialImageWinter2011.jpg"">"						
4972			EDITORIAL: <br>We Must Always Remember the Cost of War		Buman, Nathan			"<p>
With Veterans Day, November provides a special moment for us to remember that real people have passed before us to participate in and influence the events of the past.  So often when we study history, especially the Civil War, we lose that human element by elevating generals to heroic status and remembering the major battles out of the context of the war in its entirety.   The decades of the middle-nineteenth century, and the four long years of conflict between the North and South saw millions of Americans who felt strongly about their place within American society test their limits.  The study of the Civil War period provides historians with a look into the society of the past and the roles that Americans played, while Remembrance Day gently reminds us not to take that past and the efforts of our soldiers (past and present) for granted. </p>
<p>   
This Fall we feature the portrait of Private Charles Mitchel of Company D, 107th New York Volunteers.  This portrait provides a window into the world of the past.  That is what makes the continued study of the American Civil war so fascinating, the notion that we can look, time and time again, into the past through the words, lives, and actions of historical figures (famous and obscure) to discover new angles and new avenues to better understand these vital years that helped to shape the American society of today.</p>
<p>
In this quarter, we have chosen to highlight four works that help to illustrate the ways in which war changed society and the degree to which historical actors played a role in shaping the events of that period and the outcome of the war.  Margaret Abruzzo, in <i>Polemical Pain: Slavery, Cruelty, and the Rise of Humanitarianism</i>, investigates how nineteenth-century Americans debated slavery by looking at the (in)humanity of the institution with increasing ferocity up to the eve of the Civil War.  <i>A Visitation of God: Northern Civilians Interpret the Civil War</i>, by Sean A. Scott, exams the Civil War the way that northerners looked at it: through a religious lens.  Northern civilians constantly used the church and the clergy to interpret and deal with the course of the war; Scott does an excellent job of narrating this process, looking at how this effort changed the church as well.  <i>Moments of Despair: Suicide, Divorce, & Debt in Civil War Era North Carolina</i>, by David Silkenat explores the social challenges that many Civil War veterans encountered when they returned home from fighting, an eloquent reminder to consider how we treat veterans when they return to civilian life after their service to the country.  Finally, Gregory P. Downs provides an excellent narrative of the fallout of the Civil War in <i>Declarations of Dependence: The Long Reconstruction of Popular Politics in the South, 1861-1908</i>.  Southerners, white and black, necessarily compromised and jostled for position as result of emancipation and the abolition of slavery leading into the twentieth century as white and black sought to create a new society.</p>
<p>  
Civil War Book Review was very fortunate to speak with Eric Foner about his Pulitzer Prize-winning <i>The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery</i>, a book that shows us how President Lincoln evolved over time as a result of his increasing experience and the events of the Civil War.  Professor Foner urges us to remember that we are all changing over time as part of our personal growth; we can find inspiration in Lincoln.</p>
<p>
Daniel W. Crofts has provided us with an excellent Civil War Sesquicentennial column that explores Unionism in the South during the Civil War.  As Foner illustrates in his aforementioned book, Lincoln often overestimated the strength of Unionism throughout the South and Crofts brings us up to speed on this topic, providing avenues for future exploration.</p>
<p>
This quarter, Frank Williams uses <i>Lincoln Apostate: The Matson Slave Case</i> by Charles Robert McKirdy and <i>Colonization After Emancipation: Lincoln and the Movement for Black Resettlement</i> by Phillip W. Magness and Sebastian N. Page to further illustrate the personal growth of Abraham Lincoln during his life and the evolution of the way that he looked at African Americans and slavery. </p>
<p> 
Our final feature, this quarter, written by Michael Taylor, highlights a particular manuscript collection at LSU that shows the difficulties faced by those at home as they navigated the events of the war.  Four difficult years, full of unknown consequences, led soldiers and civilians alike to endure the best they could to affect the outcome and their words, as Taylor shows, give historians a better understanding of the way that people endured during the Civil War.</p>
<p>
As always, <i>Civil War Book Review</i> would like to thank the wonderful support staff and crew that makes every issue relatively easy, at least on my part.  I would like to welcome a new assistant, Alice Wolfe who will be our publicity contact.

6117			Editorial: <br>History Is Not Confined to the Ivory Tower		Isenhower, Zach			"<p>“The past is a foreign country,"" is so often repeated that it is rarely attributed to L.P. Hartley, the British novelist who coined the phrase.  The line has entered the realm of proverb because it offers a succinct reminder to exercise caution in interpreting the past, to remember context and avoid the presentism disdained by professional historians.  Yet the caution in Hartley’s quote carries its own risks.  If interpreting the past through the lens of the present is the cardinal sin of the historian’s craft, surely rendering the past so distant as to seem irrelevant follows closely behind.  Or, to put that caution about the past in literary terms, “it’s not even past.""  History is not merely a different version of our modern world, but history is never far from the world we live in.  The Fall 2015 issue of the <i>Civil War Book Review</i> is replete with the familiar, finely honed scholarship our contributors take pride in and, more than usual I think, full of the kind of unexpected connections that remind us how much of our world is not of our own making. </p>
<p>Historical roots run particularly deep in this issue.  Adam Pratt reviews <i>Jacksonland</i>, from NPR’s Steve Inskeep, which locates the development of the Deep South—so significant in American history from the mid-nineteenth century on—in 1830s and the administration of the U.S.’s seventh president.  Christopher Cameron’s <i>To Plead Our Own Cause</i>, reviewed by Andrew N. Wegmann, demonstrates the vitality of African American abolitionism, independent of white sympathizers, decades before David Walker’s famous <i>An Appeal to Coloured Citizens of the World</i>.  Stephen A. West offers a look at Gregory P. Downs’ much-anticipated <i>After Appomattox</i>, which argues that the Civil War, in reality, extended years beyond the Confederacy’s military surrender, through years of military occupation and southern resistance, reshaping American war powers and the constitutional landscape.  Calvin Schermerhorn’s <i>The Business of Slavery and the Rise of American Capitalism</i>, reviewed by Frank J. Byrne, connects the foundations of the modern U.S. capitalist economy with the tremendous economic impact of slavery in the United States. </p>
<p>While slavery and expansion into Native American lands shaped the development of the United States over the nineteenth century, James L. Huston discusses in our author interview the development of slavery and the southern plantation complex.  The explanation lies with landholding patterns established in England even before European colonial exploration.  Huston’s latest book, <i>The British Gentry, the Southern Planter, and the Northern Family Farmer</i>, reviewed in this issue by Michael Frawley, demonstrates a contrast between northern and southern agriculture that explains in concrete terms increasing sectional antagonism.  Along the way, Huston upsets many narratives about the economic prospects of slavery, the tenets of free labor and southern republicanism, and the coming of the Civil War. </p>
<p>Also engaging longstanding narratives about the war is the subject of Frank Williams’ latest column.  <i>The War Worth Fighting</i>, an insightful collection of essays edited by Stephen D. Engle and featuring preeminent scholars such as Orville Vernon Burton, Jennifer L. Weber, and Kate Masur, analyzes to what extent the war was the result of a “blundering generation"" that traumatized southern economic development and American race relations with an unnecessary conflict.  Though professional historical consensus has mostly abandoned this old hypothesis, its staying power in American society begs for continued engagement from professional scholars, and Engle’s work delivers. </p>
<p>From James Huston’s work taking readers as far back as 1066 to explain 1861, to Gregory Downs finding the war continuing after 1865, creative approaches offer long timelines and unexpected connections that bring new insight.  Perhaps the most surprising connections in this issue come from Michael Taylor’s latest “Civil War Treasures"" column, finding former Confederates discussing the fate of their lost cause while steaming unknowingly towards their own aboard the <i>Titanic</i>.  Popular film depictions of the elegant British liner’s tragic voyage, as Taylor points out, ought to include a few more southern accents among the ship’s famous passengers.  As always, this overview barely scratches the surface.  Peg Lamphier reviews a new novel about the Civil War’s own tragic sinking, the deadly explosion of the <i>Sultana</i>, and Brannon Costello looks at how dynamic media can add emotional weight to the horrors of war. </p>
<p>Finally, Robert J. Cook provides a comparative look at the Civil War centennial and sesquicentennial commemorations.  Finding a sesquicentennial that shared little of the problems, but unfortunately relatively less interest, compared to the 1960s, Cook demonstrates a common thread in this history of memory, that our recollections of the past are shaped by the needs and concerns of the present.  The sesquicentennial’s conclusion coincided with racially motivated violence and reignited debates over the Confederate battle flag and other symbols of the Confederacy.  Four years of scholarly discussion and quiet commemoration suddenly changed as the Civil War was once again thrust into the spotlight of current American affairs.  Cook shows us that history is not confined to the ivory tower, that learning is today no longer the privilege of gentility, as imagined by antebellum plantation owners.  Crucially, our work is public, it is for our students, our readers, and our society, that we can interpret the past with discipline and care, and understand the world we have inherited as we fashion the world we make.</p>

2735			EDITORIAL: <p>A Convergence of Contexts		Fava, Colleen H.			<p><br><i>Civil War Book Review</i> has been through its fair share of changes and upheavals over this past year. Early last summer I began my tenure as the new editor. In the fall we learned that our publishing partner could no longer afford to fund our journal. A few months later it was decided that the <i>Review</i> would cease print publication and move to an online only format. This transition, like all of my experiences at this journal, was remarkably smooth. This is due in no small part to the talent and dedication of Leah Wood Jewett, director of the United States Civil War Center, and our webmaster, April Ayto.</p><p>This note is written with both a heavy heart and great satisfaction, because I must report one more change. I will begin teaching Freshman Composition at LSU in the fall and so this is my final issue as editor. If we employ history as a judge û and I think our participation in this particular endeavor implies that we do û this transition, too, will be seamless. My term at the <i>Review</i> has been personally and professionally rewarding. The support of our reviewers, readership, and staff has been immeasurable. I wish I had the room to thank all of the people who have been so unsparing with their time and expertise, but I am more grateful that there are too many to list individually. I know I can count on all of you to extend your warmth and generosity to our new editor, Chris Freeman. Chris comes to us with a degree in history from Berea College in Kentucky and will be pursuing an advanced degree in Political Science at LSU. I'm sure Chris will appreciate the exposure, as I have, to the various perspectives on history, representation, language, and literature that have made their way through the space of our journal.</p><p>This issue is a perfect example of a convergence of contexts and viewpoints. Four of the books reviewed in this issue explicitly address the famous battle of Gettysburg û a battle of which even the most novice Civil War student holds at least a modicum of knowledge. These books consider the battle from contradistinctive positions. In a comparative piece, author Kent Gramm offers an analysis of two very differently focused texts, <b>Gettysburg: The Meade-Sickles Controversy</b> by Richard A. Sauers (Brassey's, ISBN 1574884883, $24.95, hardcover) and <b>The Stand of the Union Army at Gettysburg</b> by Jeffrey C. Hall (Indiana University Press, ISBN 0253342589, $49.95, hardcover). Sauers' book offers a narrow and specialized study of the controversy named in the title, while Hall presents a comprehensive study in his large coffee-table sized book. Cornelius Cronin, who teaches courses on the literature of war at Louisiana State University, evaluates another extensive campaign history devoted to the battle in his review of <b>Gettysburg</b> by Stephen W. Sears (Houghton-Mifflin, ISBN 0395867614, $30.00, hardcover). Rounding out the Gettysburg books û in our column Perspectives from Afield and Afar, û is guest columnist Jeff Smithpeters' examination of a fictional Confederate victory in <b>Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War</b> by Newt Gingrich and William R. Forstchen (Thomas Dunne Books, ISBN: 031230935X, $24.95, hardcover).</p><p>Also contained in this issue are appraisals of three books committed to varying facets of the Lincoln legacy. Executive director of the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission, Michl F. Bishop, looks at <b>Lincoln, Religion, and Romantic Cultural Politics</b> by Stewart Winger (Northern Illinois University Press, ISBN 0875803008, $38.00, hardcover); Chief Justice Frank J. Williams assesses <b>Lincoln and Booth: More Light on the Conspiracy</b> by H. Donald Winkler (Cumberland House Publishing, Inc., ISBN 1581823428, $16.95, softcover); Meg Galante-DeAngelis reviews <b>Mr. Lincoln and the Time Train</b> by WeWrite Kids a new book written for children by children (University of Illinois at Springfield, ISBN 0938943219, $8.95, softcover).</p><p>As a creative writer and native Northerner living in the Deep South, I found that one segment in particular offered an interesting and informative perspective on a writer I had long respected but apparently knew little about. David Madden has reintroduced me to that master of the short-story, O. Henry, in his column Rediscovering Civil War Classics. Madden dispels the myths that O. Henry was primarily a New York writer and exposes O. Henry's physical and literary move from South to North while revealing the never-abandoned Southern imprint on virtually all of his writing.</p><p>Additional books reviewed address women's issues, state politics, the great American pastime, economic systems, methodological approaches to studying the South, historical novels, tactical initiatives, perspectives on slavery and race relations including antebellum inter-racial relationships, wartime views from England, and contemporary representations of slavery in museums.</p><p>I am proud of the current issue of <i>Civil War Book Review</i> and I hope it brings you as much pleasure in the reading of it as I received putting the issue together. I am confident that the continued commitment of our reviewers, the staff at the United States Civil War Center and LSU Libraries, along with the energy and dedication of the new editor will ensure the success of future editions.

2957			<b>EDITORIAL:<p>History, Biography, and Character</b>		Freeman, Christopher S.			"<p><br>I am proud to present to you the <i>Civil War Book Review's</i> Fifth Anniversary Issue.  Conceived by David Madden and Michl Zibart of Book Page, materialized by Leah Jewett and the Book Page Staff, supported by Louisiana State University Libraries, under the stewardship of four different editors (Morgan Knull, Laura Ng, Coleen Fava, and myself), in both print and digital forms, the <i>Review</i> has annotated or reviewed over 1500 books about or set in the Civil War era.  Out of the hundreds of reviews, columns, and interviews the <i>Review</i> has published since the first issue in the summer of 1999, we have compiled our very best in a special <a href=""http://www.cwbr.com/civilwarbookreview/5year.htm"">highlights</a> section.  These highlights reflect the great diversity of material and high quality of scholarship the <i>Review</i> seeks to bring to you with every issue.  In addition, we are including a special feature called <a href=""http://www.cwbr.com/civilwarbookreview/traditions.htm"">""Traditions and Transformations: Five Years of Civil War Books.""</a>   Within are interviews on the past and future of Civil War publishing with preeminent historians James McPherson and Edward Ayer, literary scholar Randal Allred, novelist Thomas Dyja, and editor Sylvia Frank Rodrigue.  </p><p> The Summer 2004 Issue of the <i>Review</i> provides rich examples of the multiple lenses through which the Civil War continues to be viewed in history and memory.  From epic poetry to marine archology, we seek a fuller conception and interpretation of this seminal conflict.  One method in particular plays a prominent role in this issueùbiography.  What insights are to be gained from in-depth analysis of historical characters that cannot be gained in more general histories?  Plutarch, the great biographer of the ancient world, argues in his life of Alexander, I am not writing history but biography, and the most outstanding exploits do not always have the property of revealing the goodness or badness of the agent; often, in fact, a casual action, the odd phrase, or a jest reveals character better than battles involving the loss of thousands upon thousands of lives, huge troop movements, and whole cities besieged.</p><p>Appropriately, two of the biographical entries in this issue use Plutarch's own methodùparallel lives.  Both of these books feature Lincoln; in one he is paired with a literary contemporary and in the other he is compared to a subsequent statesman.  In Daniel Mark Epstein's <b><a href=""http://www.cwbr.com/cgi-bin/dbman/cwbr/cwbr.cgi?db=cwbr&uid=default&sb1=11&so1=descend&sb2=3&so2=ascend&ma=on&fields1=keyword&value1=lincoln+and+whitman&view_records=1&bool=and&nh=2&mh=1"">Lincoln and Whitman: Parallel Lives in Civil War Washington</a> </b> (Ballantine Books, ISBN 0345457994, $24.95, hardcover), Whitman's life is chronicled with that of his Captain.  Michl F. Bishop, of the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission, reviews this parallel treatment of Civil War Washingtonians.  Naval War College professor Mackubin Thomas Owens examines <b><a href=""http://www.cwbr.com/cgi-bin/dbman/cwbr/cwbr.cgi?db=cwbr&uid=default&sb1=11&so1=descend&sb2=3&so2=ascend&ma=on&fields1=keyword&value1=roosevelt&view_records=1&bool=and&nh=2&mh=1"">Franklin D.

This collection of essays covers the legacies, leadership, and place in history of those two great presidents.</p><p> In addition to these comparisons of historical actors, this issue has several stand alone biographies.  Paul D. H. Quigley, of University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, meditates on this long overdue biography, <b><a href=""http://www.cwbr.com/cgi-bin/dbman/cwbr/cwbr.cgi?db=cwbr&uid=default&sb1=11&so1=descend&sb2=3&so2=ascend&ma=on&fields1=keyword&value1=tubman&view_records=1&bool=and&nh=2&mh=1"">Bound for the Promised Land: Harriet Tubman, Portrait of An American Hero</a> </b> (Ballantine Books, ISBN 0345456270, $26.95, hardcover) by Kate Cliffort Larson.  Little known and peripheral figure George Bent is also the subject of a biography, <b><a href=""http://www.cwbr.com/cgi-bin/dbman/cwbr/cwbr.cgi?db=cwbr&uid=default&sb1=11&so1=descend&sb2=3&so2=ascend&ma=on&fields1=keyword&value1=halfbreed&view_records=1&bool=and&nh=2&mh=1"">Halfbreed: The Remarkable True Story of George Bent ù Caught Between the Worlds of the Indian and the White Man</a>  </b>(Da Capo Press, ISBN 0306813203, $30.00, hardcover) by David Fridtjoft Halaas and Andrew E. Masich, reviewed by Professor Barbara Cloud of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.  Lincoln is the sole subject of another important work, <b><a href=""http://www.cwbr.com/cgi-bin/dbman/cwbr/cwbr.cgi?db=cwbr&uid=default&sb1=11&so1=descend&sb2=3&so2=ascend&ma=on&fields1=keyword&value1=Cooper+Union&view_records=1&bool=and&nh=2&mh=1"">Lincoln at Cooper Union: The Speech that Made Abraham Lincoln President</a></b>  (Simon & Shuster, ISBN 0743224663, $25.00, hardcover) by Harold Holzer.  Frank J. Williams, Lincoln scholar and Rhode Island Supreme Court Justice, takes an in-depth look at this new entry into the extensive Lincoln bibliography.  Historical figures, however, are not the only subjects to be found within this addition of the <i>Civil War Book Review</i>.  In the <i>Perspectives from Afield and Afar</i> column, Temple University historian Wilbert L. Jenkins reflects upon the life of a modern scholar in <b><a href=""http://www.cwbr.com/cgi-bin/dbman/cwbr/cwbr.cgi?db=cwbr&uid=default&sb1=11&so1=descend&sb2=3&so2=ascend&ma=on&fields1=keyword&value1=John+hope&view_records=1&bool=and&nh=3&mh=1"">Tribute to John Hope Franklin: Scholar, Mentor, Father, Friend</a></b> (University of Missouri Press, ISBN 0826215041, $24.95, hardcover).</p><p>Biographies are not the only items of note within this Issue.

2873			EDITORIAL: <p> The social significance of battle		Freeman, Christopher S.			"<p><br>Social historians have explored uncharted territory and recorded many previously untold stories that capture the full scope of human experience.  Historical narratives now incorporate new perspectives; new subjects in history have gained prominence.  However, many potential influences upon social history remain untapped.  Salamis, Waterloo, the Somme, and Guadalcanal are landmarks in the annals of military history, but their influence on social history has been generally neglected.  Recent scholarship bucks this trend, integrating war with the study of culture.  This issue of the <i>Civil War Book Review</i> offers several titles that exemplify this new take on war and social history. </p><p> Classical historian Victor Davis Hanson offers his perspective on three battles that range over a period of over two thousand years in his book <b><a href=""http://www.cwbr.com/cgi-bin/dbman/cwbr/cwbr.cgi?db=cwbr&uid=default&sb1=11&so1=descend&sb2=3&so2=ascend&ma=on&fields1=keyword&value1=Spring+2004&view_records=1&bool=and&nh=1&mh=1"">Ripples of Battle: How Wars of the Past Still Determine How We Fight, How We Live, and How We Think</a></b> (Doubleday, ISBN 0385504004, $27.50, hardcover).

2807			EDITORIAL: <p> Historiography and Civil War		Freeman, Christopher S.			"<p><br>The father of history, Herodotus, in <i>The Histories</i>, wrote so that human achievement may not become forgotten in time.  While his intellectual successor, Thucydides, in <i>The History of the Peloponnesian War</i>, wrote for those who want to look into the truth of what was done in the past.  The historians craft is to shape meaning out of the tangled web of the past.  The interpreter of the past seeks out various threads that color the tapestry of a historical narrative.  The collection and weaving of these threads of history are guided by competing paradigms for evaluating historical evidence.  What constitutes human achievement and how should historians come to know the truth of what was done in the past?  In the writing of contemporary history two competing methodologies hold precedence, the new social history of the common man and the traditional military/political history of the great man.  This issue of the <i>Civil War Book Review</i> is replete with examples of both. </p><p>Edward Ayers approaches the Civil War not from the vantage point of Washington or Richmond but from the perspective of the lives of the people living adjacent to the warring cities in Augusta County, Virginia, and Franklin County, Pennsylvania.  Historian Paul Christopher Anderson reviews <b><a href=""http://www.cwbr.com/cgi-bin/dbman/cwbr/cwbr.cgi?db=cwbr&uid=default&sb1=11&so1=descend&sb2=3&so2=ascend&ma=on&fields1=keyword&value1=winter+2004&view_records=1&bool=and&nh=24&mh=1"">In the Presence of Mine Enemies: War in the Heart of America</a></b> (W.W.

Kym Rice, Assistant Professor and Assistant Director of the Museum Studies Program at The George Washington University, looks at Judith Kelleher Schafer's <b><a href=""http://www.cwbr.com/cgi-bin/dbman/cwbr/cwbr.cgi?db=cwbr&uid=default&sb1=11&so1=descend&sb2=3&so2=ascend&ma=on&fields1=keyword&value1=kym+rice&view_records=1&bool=and&nh=1&mh=1"">Becoming Free, Remaining Free</a></b> (Louisiana State University Press, ISBN 0807128627, $69.95 hardcover), a study of how slaves used the judicial system to gain their freedom in Louisiana.

3046			EDITORIAL: <p>Out of Ashes		Freeman, Christopher S.			"<p><br>The Golden Age of Roman literature occurred during the last years of a century of civil conflict and the immediate collapse of the Roman Republic.  Out of the Republic's last embers and funeral ashes came the military autobiography of Julius Csar, the great political speeches of Cicero, and Virgil's epic poem, <i>The neid</i>.  These works and others of the period would describe and define what it was and was best of about being Roman.  Virgil was especially deft at presenting the Roman spirit, embodied by the title character, the duty-bound neas.  Virgil clearly illustrates the promise and purpose of Roman empire, To spare the conquered and beat down the proud.  </p><p>Likewise, the American Civil War itself spawned great literature, much of which helped to define what it is to be American.  The poetry of Walt Whitman, Stephen Crane's great American novel on the war, and Abraham Lincoln's speech that spoke of a nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal are a few examples.  Two other authors that arise out of this tradition are featured prominently in this issue of the <i>Civil War Book Review</i>.  Mark Twain wrote his classic novels of the Mississippi and the South in the decades following the war and Ulysses S. Grant wrote one of the few books truly comparable to Csar's <i>Conquest of Gaul</i>, the <i>Personal Memoirs of U.S. Grant</i>.  David Madden, in his <i>Rediscovery</i> column, takes a look at the relationship between Grant and Twain illustrated in <b><a href=""http://www.cwbr.com/cgi-bin/dbman/cwbr/cwbr.cgi?db=cwbr&uid=default&sb1=11&so1=descend&sb2=3&so2=ascend&ma=on&fields1=keyword&value1=General+Grant&view_records=1&bool=and&nh=4&mh=1"">General Grant </a></b> (Southern Illinois University Press, 1966) by Matthew Arnold.  This slim volume contains an assessment of Grant by one of the Victorian era's most important critics, Arnold, and a speech by Twain critiquing it.  The relationship between Grant and Twain is also the explicit subject Mark Perry's modern work, <b><a href=""http://www.cwbr.com/cgi-bin/dbman/cwbr/cwbr.cgi?db=cwbr&uid=default&sb1=11&so1=descend&sb2=3&so2=ascend&ma=on&fields1=keyword&value1=Grant+and+Twain&view_records=1&bool=and&nh=1&mh=1"">Grant and Twain: The Story of a Friendship that Changed America </a></b> (Random House, ISBN 0679642730, $24.95, hardcover).  Brooks Simpson, of Arizona State University, examines this grand assessment of the friendship of these two luminaries.  In this issue's interview, Shirley Samuels discusses her new book, <b><a href=""http://www.cwbr.com/cgi-bin/dbman/cwbr/cwbr.cgi?db=cwbr&uid=default&sb1=11&so1=descend&sb2=3&so2=ascend&ma=on&fields1=keyword&value1=Facing+America&view_records=1&bool=and&nh=3&mh=1"">Facing America: Iconography and the Civil War </a></b> (Oxford University Press, ISBN 0195128974, $49.95, hardcover), which details how authors and artists of the Civil War era embody American identity within books and images.  Her work examines how the images used to represent the nation change over time. </p><p>In addition, the Review offers its staple of diverse perspectives on the Civil War.  Especially prominent is Chandra Manning's review of <b><a href=""http://www.cwbr.com/cgi-bin/dbman/cwbr/cwbr.cgi?db=cwbr&uid=default&sb1=11&so1=descend&sb2=3&so2=ascend&ma=on&fields1=keyword&value1=Diary+of+a+christian&view_records=1&bool=and&nh=1&mh=1"">Diary of a Christian Soldier: Rufus Kinsley and the Civil War</a></b> (Cambridge University Press, ISBN 052182334X, $30.00, hardcover) by David C.

Another book that examines men's reasons for fighting is <b><a href=""http://www.cwbr.com/cgi-bin/dbman/cwbr/cwbr.cgi?db=cwbr&uid=default&sb1=11&so1=descend&sb2=3&so2=ascend&ma=on&fields1=keyword&value1=Union+Jacks&view_records=1&bool=and&view_records.x=18&view_records.y=16&nh=1&mh=1"">Union Jacks: Yankee Sailors in the Civil War</a></b> (University of North Carolina Press, ISBN 080782870X, $34.95, hardcover) by Michl J.

1689			EDITORIAL:<p>The benefits of change		Fava, Colleen H.			<p><br>There is a debate circulating in literary and academic circles regarding publishing on the Internet. Many purists fear that web publishing will tarnish the sanctity of language and literature while the avant-garde is embracing the excitement of hypertext and new age information sharing. There are plenty of us who fall in between these two ends of the spectrum. As an avid reader and writer û a bibliophile, you could say û I am at times petrified by the thought of curling up on the sofa with a glass of warm red wine and a laptop. Then again as a Gen-Xer I cannot imagine obtaining driving directions, doing theoretical research, sending birthday cards, purchasing books û (this list could go on and on) without the aid of websites and the almighty email account.</p><p>The current economic climate, and its impact upon the <i>Review</i>, has influenced me to reevaluate my trepidation toward on-line publishing. Karl Marx once wrote: Mankind always sets itself only such tasks as it can solve; since looking more closely, we will always find that the task itself arises only when the material conditions necessary for its solution already exist or are at least in the process of formation. In light of the economic pressures upon the publishing industry, a new venue for publication was inevitable. If we did not have the option of posting the <i>Review</i> online we would have been forced to cease production altogether until a new print sponsor had been identified. Instead in this day and age we have the opportunity to save and relish print resources that during other times might have perished.</p><p>Several of the books being reviewed in this issue directly reflect transitional periods and the benefit of understanding change and reconstruction in both a historical and personal sense. Glenn Robins considers the impact of the Civil War on middle and upper class women of the South in Mary Culpepper's <b>All Things Altered: Women in the Wake of Civil War and Reconstruction</b> (McFarland & Company Publishers, ISBN 0786413395, $35.00, softcover). While reviewing <b>Beyond the Battlefield: Race, Memory, and the American Civil War</b> (University of Massachusetts Press, ISBN 1558493611, $19.95, softcover) by David W. Blight, Gregory Urwin discusses the importance of historical memory when considering the shortcomings of the Reconstruction era. Lance Janda assesses a new anthology aimed at revealing the dramatic effects of war on the home front edited by Joan E. Cashin, <b>The War Was You and Me: Civilians in the American Civil War</b> (Princeton University Press, ISBN 0691091749, $17.95, softcover).</p><p>As with our previous print issues we are offering reviews of biographies, military and battle histories, fiction and children's literature, and political and religious studies. The support of our reviewers and subscribers has been enormous and we are confident that the Review will continue to meet and exceed its mission whether in print, online, or both.</p> <p>Please contact our editorial offices if you have any questions, concerns, or comments.</p>		Spring 2003	2003-03-01	Editorial								"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=61 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/cwbrdefault.jpg"">"						
5990			Editorial: <br>The History We All Live		Isenhower, Zach			"<p>A special spring season is upon us.  As our readers have come to expect, the latest issue of <i>Civil War Book Review</i> is full of excellent content, but this spring in particular marks the 150th anniversary of the end of the American Civil War, and with it, a winding down of our Sesquicentennial series.  The past four years—more in many cases—have been a tremendously exciting time for Civil War scholarship.  Rarely have the fields for Civil War research been so fertile, and the importance of such scholarship so immediately apparent in our everyday world. </p>

<p>We are not quite done with the Sesquicentennial yet.  This issue features a retrospective collection of all our Sesquicentennial columns, and readers can look forward to a concluding column on Reconstruction in the Summer issue.  It is fitting, too, that this issue features John McCardell Jr.’s review of Samuel C. Hyde’s <i>The Enigmatic South</i>, a collection of essays honoring the career and scholarship of William J. Cooper, Jr., who recently retired from LSU.  Professor Cooper’s impact on the field of Southern and Civil War history is well known to many <i>CWBR</i> readers.  Those who are unfamiliar need only consult our issue archives, any number of academic journals, or the citations of myriad books to get a sense of Professor Cooper’s contributions.  Though we should note he is scarcely done producing scholarship or appearing on campus, we wish him the best in retirement. </p>

<p>Scott Hancock reviews another eminent historian of the era with a look at Eric Foner’s <i>Gateway to Freedom</i>.  Foner argues that the Underground Railroad must be understood not only as the product of the agency of African American actors, but as a major contributing factor in the coming of the Civil War.  On the other chronological end of the conflict, Mark Wahlgren Summers offers a new take on Reconstruction with <i>The Ordeal of the Reunion</i>, perhaps the most important since Foner’s foundational work twenty-seven years ago, reviewed by Douglas Egerton.  Moving through Reconstruction and beyond, W. Fitzhugh Brundage gives us a glimpse at M. Keith Harris’ examination of veterans, taking on the notion that former soldiers readily embraced sectional reconciliation, if at all, in <i>Across the Bloody Chasm</i>. </p>

<p>In “A Look at Lincoln,"" Frank Williams reviews two concise new additions to Lincoln scholarship—John F. Marszalek’s <i>Lincoln and the Military</i> and John C. Waugh’s <i>Lincoln and the War’s End</i>—that together bring the sixteenth president to the conclusion of the war.  Michael Taylor of LSU Libraries Special Collections also sheds light on Lincoln, or rather the long shadow Lincoln the historical figure casts on research and artifacts from the era with the mysterious ownership tale of a period dictionary.  Finally, we get a chance to chat with Craig A. Warren about his new book, <i>The Rebel Yell: A Cultural History</i>, for our author interview, also reviewed by Rod Andrew, Jr. </p>

<p>In his review of <i>The Rebel Yell</i>, Professor Andrew notes that the book is, among other contributions, an important reminder that the history of the Civil War did not end in 1865, 1877, the end of the nineteenth century or indeed, the beginning of the twenty-first.  Along similar boundary-pushing lines in this issue, Don H. Doyle and Richard S. Dunn both demonstrate that the field does not stop at the water’s edge, and Lea VanderVelde shows that voices once silenced can be once again heard.  Such history has a very tangible importance beyond honoring the experiences of those who came before or knowing from where our society came, worthwhile as those motives are. </p>  

<p>To some extent, I am preaching to the choir of <i>CWBR</i> readers, but as we all constantly refine our thirty-second sound bites on the relevance of our work, scholarship such as what we have here offers a lifeline against the currents of historical amnesia.  Incidents such as the now-infamous chant uttered by (former) members of the SAE fraternity at the University of Oklahoma last month illustrate the wages of that amnesia.  Addressing such controversies, which OU decisively did, obviously goes beyond imparting a sense of history.  Yet living without that sense goes a long way toward explaining how students at a prestigious university could fail to appreciate—and willfully ignore—the weight of history behind their words and the actions those words invoked, all atop an association with an organization noted for its origins in the Antebellum, slaveholding South.  To pretend that the causes and consequences of the great cataclysm in our country’s history are finished and no longer matter in the ""real world"" is to delude ourselves with a false and fragile complacency.  Borrowing Brian Matthew Jordan’s description of veterans’ struggles after the war, our challenges as teachers and students is unending.  Thankfully, so is the good scholarship.</p>"		Spring 2015	2015-05-01	Editorial								"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=106 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/LeesSurrenderSpring15.jpg"">"						
5208			EDITORIAL: <br>The Power of Politics					"<p>As November draws closer in this, a presidential election year, we are reminded of the importance and the power of politics.  The realm of politics has the power to unify, to divide, to create, and to tear down but the strong political tradition throughout the history of the United States will always help to keep modern voters informed as they make their decisions.  The power of politics most certainly influenced Americans during the Civil War period, even for those not invested in politics directly.  Looking at recent publications in the field, it remains certain that we are still trying to grapple with the power of politics during the nineteenth century, a point in this nation’s history when it progressed through its formative years.  The power of politics, in life and in literature, continues to be a powerful tool for the understanding of the American Civil War; our featured reviews in the Summer 2012 issue of <i>Civil War Book Review</i> reflect that persistent dominance.  </p>
<p>
Our editorial image this quarter shows Thomas Kitchen, a private in a Georgia Regiment, a reminder that the power of politics often has very personal results.</p>
<p>
Michael Perman’s <i>The Southern Political Tradition</i>, the result of his Walter Lynwood Fleming Lectures in Southern History, explores the vast realm of southern politics across time, investigating how southern politics transformed throughout American history from the first presidential elections into the twentieth century.  In <i>America’s Great Debate: Henry Clay, Stephen A. Douglas, and the Compromise That Preserved the Union</i>, Fergus M. Bordewich examines the crucial years following the Mexican War when the mounting sectional crisis threatened unity between North and South.  Through the Compromise of 1850, and the power of politics, Americans succeeded in staving off war for ten more years.  As the war loomed closer, however, America undertook an ambitious project when Congress began exploring its options to build the United States Capital.  Guy Gugliotta’s <i>Freedom’s Cap: The United States Capital and the Coming of the Civil War</i> highlights the relationships between a powerful cadre of inter-sectional politicians who commissioned the building of the greatest symbol of unit while the nation split apart around them.  Finally, Harold Holzer examines the Emancipation Proclamation and the role that it played in creating Abraham Lincoln’s image, both then and now, in <i>Emancipating Lincoln: the Proclamation in Text, Context, and Memory</i>.</p>
<p>  
<i>Civil War Book Review</i> was very pleased to be able to spend some time talking with Earl J. Hess, author of <i>The Civil War in the West: Victory and Defeat from the Appalachians to the Mississippi</i>.   This expansive book details the war in the Western Theater, detailing how the Union achieved such success and the challenges that northern commanders had to overcome to attain that victory.</p>
<p>
Michael Taylor, this quarter, has provided a very useful essay that explores the ways in which Baton Rouge women negotiated the difficulties of war.  Taylor shows us how they adapted and navigated the challenges that living in an occupied town deep in the heart of the Confederacy provided for them.  <i>Civil War Book Review</i> is proud of the Summer 2012 issue; we believe it is a very strong one and we hope that our readers will agree.  We certainly appreciate you taking the time to read the contents and we humbly thank the reviewers, publishers, and readers who make the effort, not only possible, but worthwhile.  </p>"	Buman, Nathan A.

5805			Editorial: <br> Breaking Camp		Frawley, Michael			"<p>As the summer begins to come to an end it is time for many of us to move back into the classroom, and, for the first time in more years than I care to count, I will be making this annual late summer transition, not as a student, but as a professor.  My dissertation is complete and defended and graduation is coming up fast.  Thus, my tenure as the editor of the <i>Civil War Book Review</i> is coming to an end.  But, as they say, I saved the best for last.</p>
<p>
This issues has a diverse crop of featured reviews.  Chandra Manning reviewed James Oakes’s recent work <i>The Scorpion’s Sting</i>, a continuation of his work on Republican anti-slavery politics.  More work continues to be done in the field of Civil War medicine as shown in Rea Redd’s review of <i>Learning from the Wounded</i> by Shauna Devine.  Remembrance and commemoration is front and center in <i>Inside Connecticut and the Civil War</i>, a collection of essays edited by Matthew Warshauer and reviewed here by Earl Mulderink.  Finally, we are featuring in this issue a book on a topic that has recently been rising in popularity, Native Americans in the Civil War, with a review by Daniel Herman of Mary Jane Warde’s <i>When the Wolf Came</i>.</p>
<p>
Of course, no issue of the <i>Review</i> would be complete without our excellent columnists.  Frank Williams, in his <i>Look at Lincoln</i> column, reviews how we still have not come to a consensus about the meaning of the war, as the vast amount of new books published on the subject shows.  The <i>Civil War Sesquicentennial</i> this issue was written by Christopher Childers, a past editor of this review.  His column gives us a look the crisis of the 1850s and the decent into war.  Next, no issue would be complete without a look at the Special Collections of the LSU Libraries.  Tara Laver’s <i>Civil War Treasures</i> column discusses some of the digital collections in the library with a specific focus on the Louisiana Constitutional Convention on 1867.  Finally, we come our author interview with Rachel Shelden and her book <i>Washington Brotherhood</i>.  This interview was conducted by the <i>Review’s</i> new editor, Zach Isenhower.</p>
<p>  
I have greatly enjoyed my time in the editor’s chair here at the <i>Civil War Book Review</i>.  My interactions with reviewers and publishers across the country is something that I will always cherish.  My time here never felt like work, which, I feel, is the highest praise that can be given to any job.  As I pack up my belongings and break camp to head out to take up my new teaching position at the University of Texas of the Permian Basin in Odessa, Texas, I am confident that I am leaving the review in good hands for many years to come.  To all of you who have reviewed, written columns, and made sure we had the books that we needed to review, thank you.  </p>"		Summer 2014	2014-08-01	Editorial								"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=121 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/summer14cover/stonehenge.jpg"">"						
5042			EDITORIAL: <br>How Does the Civil War Transcend?					"<p>Civil War historians spend so much of their craft on examining the minutiae and the nuts and bolts of their topics that it becomes easy to lose sight of the ways in which war transcends…everything.  Civil War scholars dedicate thousands of hours familiarizing themselves with and analyzing the people that they study; it is easy to lose sight of the ways in which that war transcended those people, the war itself, or even the nineteenth century more broadly.  The American Civil War grants us countless lessons with which we can better understand American history and this, the Winter 2012 issue of <i>Civil War Book Review</i> displays that we will not suffer from a lack of new and exciting scholarship anytime soon.</p>
<p>
In this issue we feature, as our cover image, a photograph of Private Bentley Weston, a bugler in Company A, 7th South Carolina Cavalry.</p>
<p>
Recent works should encourage followers of Civil War and Civil War-Era studies with its fresh perspective and re-analysis.  First William C. Harris in <i>Lincoln and the Border States: Preserving the Union</i> shares with us the precarious nature of Lincoln’s relationship with the vital border slave states as he worked tenuously to maintain Union on the frontier of the Confederacy.  In <i>The Confederate Heartland: Military and Civilian Morale in the Western Confederacy</i>, Bradley R. Clampitt shows us how Civil War soldiers, at times, transcended themselves, overcoming significant hardship and continuing to fight for four long years.  Connecting the battlefield with the home front, Clampitt reminds readers the ways in which the military depends on society and vice versa for a unified, disciplined war effort.  Barbara Gannon investigates relations between black and white veterans in the Grand Army of the Republic to explore both how they looked at the war and how they looked at one another as comrades in arms.  Gannon’s <i>The Won Cause: Black and White Comradeship in the Grand Army of the Republic</i> makes significant strides to show how the events of the war itself transcended those four years and influenced the society that emerged from the American Civil War. James Marten’s <i>Sing Not War: The Lives of Union & Confederate Veterans in Gilded Age America</i> shines light on the, sometimes difficult, reintegration of Civil War veterans back into the society that they left before the war.  Often very difficult, this process and the resulting relationships between veterans, their families, and the community at large helped to shape American society during the Gilded Age.  Finally, David Blight has provided a new and useful look at the ways in which Civil Rights-Era activists used the Civil War to inform their outlook on society and events during the twentieth century in <i>American Oracle: The Civil War in the Civil Rights Era</i>.  The Civil War certainly transcended the nineteenth century and Blight expertly shows how African-American writers and activists used the Civil War Centennial to better understand society during their own time.</p>
<p>
Adam Arenson, author of <i>The Great Heart of the Republic: St. Louis and the Cultural Civil War</i> spoke with Civil War Book Review about his work with the history of St. Louis.  A complex and fascinating study of America’s heartland, Arenson sheds new light on this vital crossroads between North, South, and West in order to better understand American history more broadly.</p>
<p>
Our Civil War Sesquicentennial Feature Column this quarter, provided by Chandra Manning, provides a phenomenal outlook on the status of Civil War historiography relating to the study of Union soldiers and their motivations for fighting.  Professor Manning has certainly provided an important contribution to <i>Civil War Book Review</i>, providing us with a pulse on the current scholarship while suggesting a few points where scholars might continue to push the envelope in the future.</p>
<p>
In the Civil War Treasures feature this quarter, Michael Taylor shines light on some fascinating developments taking place at the LSU Special Collections.  The digitization of historical documents seems to be the way of the future and Taylor highlights the ways in which LSU is standing at the frontlines of this effort, providing some excellent opportunities for Civil War scholars to access parts of LSU’s collection from their own home or office.</p>
<p>
 <i>Civil War Book Review</i> would like to thank the readers and contributors for the continued support.  Time and time again, we are reminded how the enthusiasm for Civil War studies transcends all and we will continue to push forward together.  </p>"	Buman, Nathan	Winter 2012	2012-02-01	Editorial								"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=250 height=291 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/EditorialImagewinter12.jpg"">"						
5285			EDITORIAL: <br>Maintaining the Cutting Edge					"<p>Civil War scholarship remains on the cutting edge as historians continue to seek new ways to explore the terrible conflict while “celebrating"" its passing 150 years later.  Whether treading over old territory with new modes for studying the war or using new methods to discover entirely fresh aspects with which we can achieve a better understanding of this complex and enduring event, historians continue to provide new and renewed examinations that provide for thoughtful conversation.  In this, the Fall issue of <i>Civil War Book Review,</i>, we feature four works that highlight new avenues for Civil War study and suggest new routes for further examination in the future as we continue to analyze those four grueling years while we continue down the road of Civil War scholarship toward the Bicentennial in the not-terribly-distant future.</p>
<p>
Our Photographic feature for the observance of the Civil War Sesquicentennial shows Private Francis E. Brownell, member of the 11th New York Infantry and recipient of the Medal of Honor (the first to obtain this honor during the war) for his role in killing Confederate sympathizer, James W. Jackson, who had shot Colonel Elmer E. Ellsworth.</p>
<p>
Our feature reviews this quarter begin with Andre Fleche’s <i>The Revolution of 1861: The American Civil War in the Age of Nationalist Conflict</i>, which expands the scope of the Civil War into a broader perspective for analysis.  Placing the war in an international context, we better understand what the war meant to the overall flow of history and developments across the globe as Confederates adopted aspects of European nationalist movements.  Next, Walter Stahr has provided a magnificent new study of one of the political giants of the period in <i>Seward: Lincoln’s Indispensable Man</i>.  This updated look at William Seward helps to explain the challenging months around secession and Civil War while providing new clues to some of the mysteries that have surrounded him for decades.  Clayton Jewett has compiled a wide-ranging collection of essays that explore many thoughtful and exploratory topics, ranging from “Race and Warfare in the South"" to “Memory and the American Civil War.""  Many prominent historians have gathered together to contribute to this impressive assortment in <i>The Battlefield and Beyond: Essays on the American Civil War</i>.  Finally, Yael A. Sternhell, in <i>Routes of War: The World of Movement in the Confederate South</i>, has provided some of the cutting edge Civil War scholarship that helps to move us along in our greater understanding of that moment in time.  By examining the role that roads and the concept of movement played in how southerners, both black and white, experienced the war should pique our interest and urge us to seek other new mediums for wartime studies.</p>
<p>
Professor William J. Cooper graciously sat with us to discuss his new book, <i>We Have the War Upon Us: The Onset of the Civil War, November 1860-April 1861</i>, a massively important work that explores the months between Lincoln’s election and the first shots at Fort Sumter.  By exploring how the politicians interacted with one another in their attempts (and subsequent failure) to stave off the conflict, we can more easily understand the complexity of these relationships and the sectional crisis during which they endured.</p>
<p>
Michael Taylor has contributed again in a masterful way with his essay on a Civil War surgeon from Iowa.  Literally, on the cutting edge of scholarship, this examination of Dr. John Eastman helps us to achieve a clearer picture of how soldiers experienced the war, suffering from disease and deprivation, with a fear almost as strong as that which they felt when facing the enemy on the battlefield.</p>
<p>
As my time as editor of <i>Civil War Book Review</i> winds to a close (my final issue will appear in Winter 2013), I cannot begin to thank those who have contributed to the journal during my time.  The reviewers, publishers, authors, and-most of all-the readers who make the efforts of all the rest worthwhile, have continuously made this experience one of enjoyment and great importance.  <i>Civil War Book Review</i> would like to thank the support of everyone, including the LSU Libraries for their continued help in making this a successful venture.</p>"	Buman, Nathan	Fall 2012	2012-11-01	Editorial								"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=249 height=289 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/EditorialFall2012.jpg"">"						
6177			Editorial: <br>On Old Facts and New Understandings		Isenhower, Zach			"<p>I was perusing a garage sale not long ago when among the antique Tupperware and forgotten cassette tapes I came across a set of encyclopedias.  It was a grand old set, complete, with bindings meant to look substantial and authoritative just sitting on a shelf.  Thirty years ago they probably cost a considerable sum.  An orange sticker noted $7.00 for the set.  My wife and I deliberated briefly on whether we could make some use of them, really more than anything out of a sense of responsibility to rescue some old books from the recycle bin.  Of course, they were too outdated to serve their original purpose and would take up entirely too much space to justify.  But the owner noticed our pause and decided to try to sell us on the set.  With the air of someone letting us in on the truth of a great misconception, she uttered a phrase guaranteed to make a historian blanche, “they’re still good, just facts, after all it’s not like history changes!""  Thank goodness that as with human understanding of psychology, medicine, or economics, reexamining the past <i>does</i> continually produce new knowledge.  Preparing this Winter 2016 issue reminded me of that exchange because of the astounding rate at which our sense of history—events studied time and again—evolves, and also because of the challenge the exchange suggests of communicating the latest findings to a broader public.</p>

<p>The works in this issue meet both of these challenges head-on.  In Charles Dew’s review of Brent Tarter’s latest book <i>Daydreams and Nightmares</i>, an accessibly slender but incisive look at one Virginia family, Tarter demonstrates the disruption of secession and war even for people who tried their best to adjust to the political and military fortunes of their communities.  In the realm of strategy, John Beeler reviews Robert Browning’s in-depth research on the Union naval effort and the West Gulf Blockading Squadron, <i>Lincoln’s Trident</i>.  In the Gulf, Browning finds considerable holes in a blockade composed of traditional sailing vessels, rather than a near-impenetrable ironclad stranglehold on Confederate shipping.  For military specialists and general Civil War readers alike, the Overland Campaign and the Battle of Petersburg might seem familiar studies, but <i>Cold Harbor to the Crater</i>, a new volume from UNC Press’ Military Campaigns of the Civil War series, edited by Gary Gallagher and Caroline Janney and reviewed here by Christian Keller, solidifies connections between the end of the Overland Campaign and the famous Petersburg siege.</p>

<p>Perhaps no aspect of sectional crisis and the Civil War has been more researched than slavery, and arguably no aspect has added more to understanding the nation’s past.  This issue offers two important new looks at how slavery ended, a process that took nearly a century.  Patrick Rael’s <i>Eighty-Eight Years</i> and Ira Berlin’s <i>The Long Emancipation</i>, reviewed together in this issue by Edward Ayers, provide differing perspectives on this process.  Rael reexamines the oft-cited fact that slavery was not unique to the United States, and instead highlights the globally anomalous place that slavery held in American society, which caused it to be one of the very last nations on earth to disband the institution.  In this context, American slavery’s eventual end may have been certain, but the manner and duration of its demise was highly particular to the U.S.  Berlin, our guest for this issue’s author interview, shows even greater levels of contingency.  <i>The Long Emancipation</i> emphasizes the free and enslaved African Americans at the heart of the matter, and how their unending efforts—often all but alone—had the effect of eroding slavery even as they achieved gains and suffered setbacks at an uneven and uncertain pace.</p>

<p>If slavery is the most studied aspect of the era, the Civil War of course also provides the most studied U.S. president.  Yet as with the other projects in this issue, work on Lincoln offers improved understanding of a man cited at nearly all levels of American society.  Harold Holzer—no stranger to Lincoln—and Norton Garfinkle recover a Lincoln deeply concerned with economic justice in Frank J. Williams’ review of <i>A Just and Generous Nation</i>.  With the coming end of slavery and the fight for civic inclusion for African Americans, Lincoln understood that legal equality was all but meaningless if lack of access stymied economic opportunity for Americans, black or white.</p>

<p>The new work inspired by the old facts of the Civil War certainly does not end with professional historians.  In this issue’s feature column, novelist David Madden calls for a renewed look at some of the classics of Civil War fiction, and encourages the new approaches taken by younger generations of writers.  Rather than rehashing the themes of glory and loss associated with some of the best-known novels on the era, these works range geographically from the borderlands to the home front, and thematically from the brutality of the war in its time to madness and Civil War memory in modern times.</p>

<p>Finally, in this issue’s “Civil War Treasures"" column, Jessica Lacher-Feldman reminds readers that the words and images of old histories can offer us new insight when read with care and creativity.  Her examination of an impressive collection of children’s literature published on the subject between the 1880s and 1930s reveals Civil War history in its infancy, when each story and image elicited connections for readers to parents, grandparents, acquaintances and friends.  Published as histories of the recent past, these books over time became artifacts in their own right.</p>

<p>Naturally, the rest of the issue is replete with a variety of works.  Clifton Ellis gives us a look at Joy Giguere’s new book on the memorial architecture so common in Civil War era cemeteries North and South.  Thomas C. Mackey takes on George Kateb’s new meditation on Abraham Lincoln’s political philosophy, and Mark Cheathem reviews a new volume of essays developing our understanding of political parties leading up to the war.  Each, I hope readers will agree, taking up the challenge of renewing our understanding of old facts and old legends.</p>"		Winter 2016	2016-02-01	Editorial								"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=99 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/Winter16Cover.jpg"">"						
3452			<b>The Civil War in History and Memory</b><br>		Freeman, Christopher Skye			<p>It has been a difficult time for the <i>Civil War Book Review</i> and the rest of the Louisiana community the past several months.  In the aftermath of Katrina, Frank Hardie, both my successor and predecessor as editor of the Review, was forced through difficult circumstances to leave Louisiana and had to give up his post at the helm of our publication.  During this period of transition, I have resumed my role as editor of the <i>Review</i>.  However, before he left, Frank was able to do most of the work on this issue.  Thus, I would like to extend my thanks and appreciation for all of his excellent work over the last year and my best wishes for him and his family.  </p><p>This Issue is filled with books on a plethora of topics on the Civil War; however, several studies on memory, history, and commemoration truly stand out.  Among our featured reviews is <b>Defining Moments: African American Commemoration & Political Culture in the South, 1863-1913</b> (University of North Carolina Press, ISBN 0807856223, $19.95 paper) by Kathleen Ann Clark.  This work, reviewed by Mitch Kachun, examines the political function of African American Commemorations in the south in the fifty years following the Civil War.  Another work with a similar theme is <b>Cities of the Dead: Contesting the Memory of the Civil War in the South, 1865-1914</b> (University of North Carolina Press, ISBN 0807828963, $34.95 hardcover) by William Blair.  Geraldo Lujan Cadava examines Blair's argument that rather than leading to reconciliation during the Reconstruction Period, commemorations were really objects of conflict.  In addition to these reviews, Frank Hardie's interview of Edward Ayers on his book, <b>What Caused the Civil War? Reflections on the South and Southern History</b> (W.W. Norton & Co., ISBN 0393059472, $24.95, hardcover),  addresses issues such as the cause of the Civil War and how the Civil War has effected and continues to shape the South and especially Southern history today. </p><p>The Winter 2006 Issue is also filled with reviews and articles on a variety of other topics.  For instance, James Hardy has delved into 6 Civil War Atlas and offers this in-depth examination on the art of cartography.   In this Issues' Rediscovery Column, David Madden takes a look at how children have been portrayed and thought about in Civil War literature.  In this column, Madden compares and examines Mark Twain's <b>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</b>, Ambrose Bierce's short story Chickamauga, William Faulkner's <b>The Unvanquished</b>, among others.  Also, Elizabeth Ammons examines <b>Uncle Tom Mania: Slavery, Minstrelsy, and Transatlantic Culture in the 1850's </b>(University of Georgia Press, ISBN 0820327360, $54.95, hardcover) by Sarah Meer, which studies the effect that Harriet Stow's novel had upon the cultural landscape just prior to the Civil War. </p><p>Also, I would like to direct your attention to three other excellent pieces in this issue.  Two of them are about law and politics of the Civil War Era.  In reference to constitutional law, Michl Berheide reviews <b>Justice Curtis in the Civil War Era: At the Crossroads of American Constitutionalism</b> (University of Virginia Press, ISBN 0813923425, $37.50, hardcover) by Stuart Streichler, which follows the legal thinking of the only dissenter in the Dread Scot Case.  Christopher Phillips examines Ben H. Severance theory about reconstruction politics in <b>Tennessee's Radical Army: The State Guard and Its Role in Reconstruction, 1867-1869</b> (University of Tennessee Press, ISBN 1572333626, $35.00 hardcover).  Finally, in this Issues Civil War Treasures Column, Leah Wood Jewett gives us a guide to the Robert A. Mullen correspondence in <b>Prompt succor: Boston nun offers comfort to New Orleans prisoner</b>. </p>		Winter 2006	2006-01-11	Editorial								"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=61 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/cwbrdefault.jpg"">"						
5868			Editorial: <br> The Importance of Peer Review		Isenhower, Zach			"<p>It is a great honor for me to be able to formally introduce myself to our readers.  The past few months have been a busy time, many of us in the middle of our fall semester.  I have been lucky to take over the <i>Civil War Book Review</i> with the support of the staff at LSU Special Collections, and with the journal having been handed off to me in such excellent shape by our previous editor, Michael Frawley.  These past few months have also driven home to me the staggering volume of excellent scholarship being produced on the era, and the many more questions uncovered with each work. </p>
<p>This Issue’s featured reviews cover a broad array of Civil War scholarship, from religion and antislavery to politics to memory.  Margot Minardi reviews <i>Quakers and Abolition</i>, edited by Brycchan Carey and Geoffrey Plank, a collection of essays adding valuable nuance to the well-known connection between the Friends, antislavery, and abolition.  John David Smith examines Brian Wills’ revisit of Nathan Bedford Forrest and Fort Pillow in his review of <i>The River Was Dyed with Blood</i>.  Work on the memory and interpretation of the war and its battlefields focuses on the role of the National Park Service in J. Christian Spielvogel’s <i>Interpreting Sacred Ground</i>, reviewed by Mark Ehlers.  Finally, Kevin Adams reviews Jonathan W. White’s critical reexamination of the role Union soldiers played in Republican victory in the election of 1864. </p>
<p>As always, this issue of <i>CWBR</i> also contains four feature columns, some familiar and some new.  Hans Rasmussen offers a look at the plight of unemployed Confederate veterans in this issue’s <i>Civil War Treasures</i> column.  While the importance of the Civil War to creating some of the first social security programs in American history with veteran’s pensions is well known, resultant focus on Union veterans overshadows the experience of Southern veterans, who could hardly expect the largesse of the government they had rebelled against.  Rasmussen’s column reminds us how different the two group’s experiences could be.  In <i>A Look at Lincoln</i>, Frank Williams offers a look at Harold Holzer’s work on Lincoln’s use of the press.  Our author interview this issue features William S. King, independent scholar and author of <i>To Raise Up a Nation</i>. </p>
<p>It is a time of transition for <i>CWBR</i>, not only as we change editors, but as the Sesquicentennial begins winding down.  In response, this issue debuts a new column opportunity for the <i>Review</i>, space to continue our role as a facilitator for dialogue among the best scholars on the era, as we see in James Oakes’ and Chandra Manning’s conversation following last issue’s review of <i>The Scorpion’s Sting</i>.  I hope this space will, when appropriate, continue to offer a forum for fruitful discussion in future issues. </p>
<p>Finally, to return to the title of this editorial, the past few months has also served reminder to the crucial role of peer review.  Little more can be said, at this point, about the flaws in the now-infamous (and retracted) review of Edward Baptist’s <i>“The Half Has Never Been Told:"" Slavery and the Making of American Capitalism</i> from the September issue of the <i>Economist</i>.  The review’s critique of Baptist for failing to be “objective"" in his treatment of the system of human enslavement suggests much for the ongoing need for scholarship such as we see in this issue.  The almost universal backlash against the review offers hope that such scholarship does have an impact.  Yet the <i>Economist</i> debacle also offers a reminder of the importance of peer review and accountability, of dialogue and of the role of publications like <i>Civil War Book Review</i>.  Such publications not only provide a forum for dialogue and review, but a window to the ever-evolving context of published scholarship.  In short, they are the crucial medium for discussion and for holding elements of that discussion accountable to historical research. </p>
<p>The most troubling aspect of the <i>Economist</i> review is, of course, its lack of awareness about its assertions.  Though the reviewer is correct in saying that Baptist is uncontroversial in connecting slavery to the growth of American power, the review misses by interpreting Baptist’s argument as a mere attack on “traditional"" elements of American success.  The review then names several largely out-of-date explanations, overlooking that the contribution of Baptist’s emphasis on “calibrated pain"" returns emphasis to the human terms of slavery.  While accusing Baptist of dismissing economic causation, the reviewer seems unaware of how often economic abstraction has been abused in the service of slavery apology.  The review goes so far as to rehash the well-debunked Dunning School argument that the economic importance of slaves precluded serious maltreatment.  Suffice to say, closer familiarity with current scholarship might have done wonders for the author’s problematic conclusions. </p>
<p>As troubling as the <i>Economist</i> review’s assertions, however less discussed, is its fundamental lack of accountability.  Entering the field of peer review demands academic thoughtfulness and respect.  Knowing that our peers will hold our assertions accountable to historical scholarship is part of what safeguards the integrity of the field.  The <i>Economist</i> review, in contrast, is an anonymous jab.  Such anonymity subverts the very purpose of peer review.  It also distorts dialogue, replacing the fruitful discussion of peer review with clumsy, antagonistic complaint followed by an equally clumsy retraction. </p>
<p>Certainly, pressures beyond avoiding accountability promote such short-form anonymity.  As information becomes increasingly accessible and instantaneous, institutions seek flexibility in creating that information in a competitive marketplace.  Anonymous entries written by large staffs are one strategy for such flexibility.  I do not claim to know what pressures prevailed on the <i>Economist</i> in running their review as it read.  As a quarterly journal, <i>Civil War Book Review</i> makes no claims on having mastered the furious pace of today’s information economy.  Yet, as an open, online journal, <i>CWBR</i> also strives for a balance between making good scholarship rapidly accessible to the broadest possible audience, and facilitating the steady peer review necessary for such scholarship.  Ever appreciative of you, our readers, we shall continue to strive for that balance.</p>"		Fall 2014	2014-11-01	Editorial								"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=94 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/Fall14Cover/TragicPrelude.jpg"">"						
6244			Editorial: <br>The Broad Reach of the Civil War Era		Isenhower, Zach			"<p>Preparing issues of the <i>Civil War Book Review</i>, it is easy to get caught up in the sheer volume of scholarship produced on the era.  The temptation is to point out again and again the hundreds of combined reviews and annotations over the course of a year or two.  In fairness, the numbers <i>are</i> amazing.  Yet arguably the more impressive aspect of this scholarship is its diversity. </p>
<p>Among the cutting-edge themes explored in this issue is the importance of urban spaces to our understanding of the intersections of race, class, politics, economics, and ethnicity in the Civil War era.  T. Michael Parrish offers a look at <i>Confederate Cities: The Urban South During the Civil War Era</i> edited by Andrew Slap and Frank Towers.  This collection of essays illustrates the cultural, economic, and social costs of war in the areas often hardest hit.  Southern cities were also sites of particular dynamics among slaves, free blacks, ethnic immigrants, and white working class and elite southerners.  This issue features an interview with Jeff Strickland, author of <i>Unequal Freedoms: Ethnicity, Race, and White Supremacy in Civil War-Era Charleston</i>, which highlights how immigration and ethnicity played a vital role in shaping politics, social hierarchy, and racial identity in the South.</p>
<p>Shifting perspective from broad urban social dynamics in Confederate cities to a single observer’s view from one city, Minoa D. Uffelman examines a fresh edition of J.B. Jones’ wartime record, <i>A Rebel War Clerk’s Diary: At the Confederate States Capital</i>, edited by James I. Robertson, Jr.  In two volumes, Robertson turns his careful eye on an account over 150 years old, improving its accessibility and offering insight to the latest generation of scholars. </p>
<p>Offering new perspective on seemingly well-known aspects of the war are Kyle S. Sinisi and Steven Lubet.  Sinisi’s work, reviewed by Aaron Astor, takes readers to mid-1864, when the Confederate military embarked upon its final foray into Union territory.  Eschewing the more frequently trod paths following Jubal Early or John Bell Hood, Sinisi traces Sterling Price’s expedition into Missouri and examines the reasons why that state—long known for Confederate sympathy—failed to become a Confederate success story of liberation from Union forces.  In Gordon S. Barker’s review of Lubet’s <i>The Colored Hero of Harper’s Ferry: John Anthony Copeland and the War Against Slavery</i>, readers will similarly find a new take on the familiar.  Lubet focuses on one of John Brown’s earliest allies in the famous raid on Harper’s Ferry.  Copeland offered crucial legitimacy to Brown’s project, which sought significant black participation.  Lubet’s work helps widen the spotlight often reserved for Brown. </p>
<p>Keeping with a theme of diversity, Frank Williams gives his take on two new works on Abraham Lincoln.  Michael Anderegg’s <i>Lincoln and Shakespeare</i> explores the literary inspiration often closest to the heart of the sixteenth president.  Terry Alford, on the other hand, offers a close-up of Lincoln’s assassin in his much-anticipated <i>Fortune’s Fool: The Life of John Wilkes Booth</i>.  LSU Special Collections’ Hans Rasmussen uncovers a fascinating collaboration of two music writers who did not just write for diverse political candidates, but for opponents Rutherford B. Hayes and Samuel J. Tilden during the election of 1876.</p>
<p>Readers will also find a great number of diverse regions covered by the titles reviewed in this issue.  The Civil War in New Mexico, Arkansas, Massachusetts, Tennessee, and Kentucky all receive specific analysis.  Film buffs too will be particularly delighted by new scholarship on, among other themes, <i>Gone with the Wind</i>, as well as the legacy of the Civil War in the Ku Klux Klan and <i>Birth of a Nation</i>.  When it comes to scholarship it seems the Civil War era knows few boundaries.  We wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>"		Spring 2016	2016-05-01	Editorial								"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=120 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/NOLAImage.jpg"">"						
6052			Editorial: <br>Reconstruction and the Sesquicentennial		Isenhower, Zach			"<p>Sesquicentennial commemoration all over the country, and indeed the world, draws to a close this summer.  Yet the reverberations of America’s Civil War have rarely seemed so present.  As Gregory Downs and Kate Masur demonstrate in this issue’s Sesquicentennial column, the 150<sup>th</sup> anniversary only moves into increasingly complex terrain, even as the last guns of 1865 fell silent.  Readers will find excellent guides to that terrain in this issue. </p>

<p>James McPherson’s latest book, <i>The War that Forged a Nation</i>, tackles this complex legacy, as Matthew Stanley shows in his review, right from the subtitle, “Why the Civil War Still Matters.""  McPherson reminds readers how the war not only ended slavery, but reshaped citizens’ expectations of their government, the definitions of citizenship, and ultimately, he argues, that Reconstruction recast the Civil War as the longest in American history. </p>

<p>In his review of Alex Gourevitch’s <i>From Slavery to the Cooperative Commonwealth</i>, Christopher Tomlins explores American conceptions of liberty and freedom.  In Gourevitch’s work, Tomlins reveals a deft assessment not just of a historical American definition of republicanism, but a timely reflection on current American notions of liberty, as well as its limits. </p>

<p>Shifting from the macro scale to the micro, Ashley Baggett offers a look at Lisa Tendrich Frank’s analysis of women in the path of Sherman’s march in <i>The Civilian War</i>.  Carefully researched and tightly focused, Frank’s book demonstrates the impact Southern women had not just on the Confederate war effort, but on the efforts of the Union’s most fearsome invasion force.  As the epitome of Southern femininity and an integral piece to defining Southern masculinity, these women represented a significant challenge for Sherman’s mission to break the rebellious South. </p>

<p>Catherine Jones takes readers through the Reconstruction that followed Southern capitulation through the experiences and issues surrounding Southern children—black and white.  Anya Jabour’s review of <i>Intimate Reconstructions</i> provides a look at this fascinating approach, showing how debates over children and the family frequently followed, and even stood in, for postwar struggles over the meanings of freedom, resistance, union, Northern victory, and Southern defeat. </p>

<p>As with the legacy of Reconstruction, the memory of Lincoln’s death is not yet at rest.  In Frank Williams’ “Look at Lincoln,"" column, our resident Lincoln expert examines Richard Wightman Fox’s <i>Lincoln’s Body</i> and Martha Hodes’ <i>Mourning Lincoln</i>.  Together, these works illustrate how the national outpourings of emotion that followed Lincoln’s death continued to wind through history and memory long after his funeral train finished clattering its way through the American countryside. </p>

<p>As politicians, jurists, and historians wrestled with the meanings of the Civil War even as Reconstruction was underway, veterans grappled with the physical and emotional consequences of the war.  This issue’s author interview features Brian Craig Miller discussing his most recent work, <i>Empty Sleeves</i>, also reviewed in this issue by Steven Noll.  Miller follows the experiences of Southern amputees, denied the support of Federal programs, as they fought for recognition and support.  Their struggles, Miller shows, forced a reckoning of Southern conceptions of honor, masculinity, and the Lost Cause with the difficult realities of disability and dependence. </p>

<p>As always, the overview of this issue’s featured content only scratches the surface of what readers will find.  Also included are Matthew Carr’s provocative take on William T. Sherman and American military culture, William E. and Erica L. Gienapp’s tremendously useful and careful work on the diary of Gideon Welles, and the latest of Earl Hess’ work revising the tactics and technology mismatch narrative of Civil War battles. </p>

<p>Perhaps the most important contribution of so much excellent scholarship on Reconstruction is the clarity of hindsight it provides to the events we have commemorated for the past four years.  Reconstruction, with all the drama of idealistic efforts to raise up former slaves, reunion, Southern resistance, ultimately tepid Northern commitment to equal rights for black citizens, reshaping of the Southern economy, and more, demonstrates the causes over which the war was fought.  It exposes the difference between the side issues and the matters at root of the conflict.  Reconstruction reflects, in many ways, the war’s beginning.  After four intensive years studying battles, leaders, ordinary soldiers and civilians, and all aspects of American society amid civil war, studying Reconstruction demonstrates the issues that even 700,000 dead could not resolve.  It serves as reminder that postwar Southern redeemer governments fought to institute black codes and suppress black citizenship, not to renegotiate tariffs or debate states’ rights.  It reminds us that the Confederate battle flag vanished from American (not just Southern) political life until the Civil Rights movement, one hundred years after Lee’s surrender at Appomattox.  Over fifty years later still, the flag that those surrendering Confederates furled, that protesters of integration unfurled, is just now coming down from its final places of current (not historical) display.  Undoubtedly, such symbols have a range of meanings for different individuals.  No individual interpretation, however, can supplant the historical record of causes and legacies of the Civil War.  <i>CWBR</i> hopes to help ensure that such accurate historical context is never lost from the ongoing discussion of “why the Civil War still matters.""</p>

5363			EDITORIAL: <br>The Guard Always Changes but the Quality Remains the Same		Buman, Nathan			"<p>Since the smoke cleared from battlefields across the United States and the guns of the Civil War’s combatants fell silent Americans began their timeless endeavor to understand what they had endured.  This (now 150-year-old) struggle to understand the complexity of the war and its causes guarantees that, as the generations pass, we will always remain in good hands.  Civil War scholarship has evolved constantly since the war and continues to do so in fascinating and insightful ways, hinting that continued research and interest in this topic will continue to yield ripe fruit.  The Winter 2013 issue of <i>Civil War Book Review </i>will be my last as editor of this fine publication but the conversation will continue and well-qualified hands will lend their guidance in the issues to come.  Michael Frawley, who conducted the interview in this issue will take over as editor and I do not doubt that he will prove more than capable of this task.  </p>
<p>
In this the Winter issue, we feature several books that provide nuanced ways of examining the Civil War and this cutting edge scholarship helps to guide the next generation to a better understanding of its past.  Christopher Childers, a former editor of <i>Civil War Book Review </i>himself, has written an excellent work that examines the concept of popular sovereignty and the ways in which it challenged Americans prior to the Civil War as they sought to combat the mounting sectional crisis.  <i>The Failure of Popular Sovereignty: Slavery, Manifest Destiny, and the Radicalization of Southern Politics </i>will undoubtedly prove a useful text for many years to come.  Gary W. Gallagher and Rachael A. Shelden have compiled and edited a vital collection of essays that explore other political questions.  <i>A Political Nation: New Directions in Mid-Nineteenth-Century American Political History </i>proves the continued viability of political history and its contents will appeal to a varied range of scholars.  James M. McPherson has provided a comprehensive analysis of naval operations during the Civil War in <i>War on the Waters: The Union & Confederate Navies, 1861-1865</i>.  McPherson’s contribution will surely stand tall for many years to come and contribute a great deal to the conversation about naval warfare.  Megan Kate Nelson breaks new ground in <i>Ruin Nation: Destruction and the American Civil War</i>.  In this study, Nelson digs deeper to provide an understanding of what the war did<i> to</i> people and their environment, blending Civil War studies with environmental history in a very helpful way.  </p>
<p>
James Oakes graciously granted <i>Civil War Book Review</i> an interview and our new editor, Michael Frawley, conducted this interview.  Frawley and Oakes discussed his new Gilder Lehrman Lincoln Prize-winning <i>Freedom National: The Destruction of Slavery in the United States, 1861-1865 </i>which explores Republican Party policy toward slavery both before and during the four years of conflict.</p>
<p>  
We have several other excellent features this quarter as well.  Michael Taylor highlights a collection of letters that shows the intimate relationship between a southerner and his family as the war loomed.  Randall Miller wrote a very useful essay for our sesquicentennial column that examines the complex ascendency of Abraham Lincoln in the presidential election of 1860.  Finally, Frank Williams looks at a recent documentary history of Mary Lincoln’s insanity trial in order to better understand one of the least-favored first ladies in American history.</p>
<p>
As always, and for the last time, I must remind our readers that this scholarly journal would not happen if not for the excellent support staff, including our editorial assistant David Blankenship (who will also leave his post this spring), our fantastic library and special collections staff who help us, and the readers, reviewers, and publishers who continue to work with <i>Civil War Book Review </i>and make this a worthwhile venture.  </p."

5932			Editorial: <br> Scholarship on All Scales		Isenhower, Zach			"<p>The air is cool (though some of our readers will rightfully scoff at my saying so in Baton Rouge), classrooms are full, and our bookshelves are full of exciting new titles.  The signs are all here.  To paraphrase the tagline of a popular television show, the Winter issue has come.</p>
<p>This issue’s featured reviews demonstrate how fruitful the field remains for scholarship of nearly every scale of analysis.  Brian Steel Wills reviews <i>The Early Morning of War</i> by Edward G. Longacre, a return to the first major battle of the conflict and the men who fought in it.  Joseph Dawson and Rea Redd offer a look at the politics and policies of the leaders of the divided nation, with reviews of, respectively, James M. McPherson’s <i>Embattled Rebel</i> and Harold Holzer’s <i>Lincoln and the Power of the Press</i>.  The Analytical scale widens further with a collection of groundbreaking essays in <i>The Civil War as Global Conflict</i>, edited by David T. Gleeson and Simon Lewis, and reviewed by Paul D. Escott.</p>
<p>In this issue’s <i>Civil War Treasures</i> column, Michael Taylor of LSU Special Collections offers a window to the changed experiences and practical considerations of death that the loved ones of fallen soldiers faced during the Civil War through the experiences of one New Orleans undertaker.  <i>A Look at Lincoln</i> is on hiatus this issue, but Frank Williams will return in the Spring.  Our Sesquicentennial feature returns this issue with an in-depth look at guerilla warfare in Civil War scholarship by Christopher Phillips.  Finally, our author interview ranges from the end of the war to modern-day memory in our conversation with Anne Sarah Rubin, Associate Professor of History at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and author of <i>Through the Heart of Dixie: Sherman’s March and American Memory</i>.</p>
<p>This issue, like all the work we do here at <i>CWBR</i>, would be impossible without the support of LSU Libraries and Special Collections, and the labor of staff members like our Editorial Assistant, Caitlyn O’Quin.  Just as critical are our reviewers, who produce the quality material showcased in <i>CWBR</i>, and of course our readers.  For everyone trying to keep out of the cold, I hope our Winter issue provides the books you need to pair with your favorite warm beverage and reason for staying indoors.</p>"		Winter 2015	2015-02-01	Editorial								"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=102 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/SnowyFormation.jpg"">"						
3501			Changes and Transformations		Freeman, Christopher Skye			<p>The Spring 2006 Issue of the <i>Civil War Book Review</i> is highlighted by several important works in Civil War scholarship and fiction.  <b>The March</b>, the latest novel by E.L. Doctorow, writer of some of the most significant Civil War novels in recent memory, is reviewed by June Pullium.  Doctorow's novel dramatizes Sherman's March to the Sea and many of the important figures of that event and the era find a part within it.  Also in this Issue, Frank Williams takes a look at Doris Kearns Goodwin's <b>Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln</b>, which demonstrates how Lincoln was able to form his cabinet and advisors out of many of his political opponents.  Valerie Ziegler examines a work that adds another dimension from which to study Reconstruction, religion.  <b>Vale of Tears: New Essays on Religion and Reconstruction</b>, is a collection of essays edited by Edward J. Blum and W. Scott Poole that tackles the role of religion in the reconstruction of the South.  Another review of note is <b>Confederate Emancipation: Southern Plans to Free and Arm Slaves during the Civil War</b> by Bruce Levine.  This work, reviewed by W. Fitzhugh Brundage, delves into the Confederacy's own plans for emancipation of the slaves and how the issue was divisive one during the war.  </p><p>Among this Issues features and columns, Beth A. Salerno is interviewed about her book <b>Sister Societies: Women's Antislavery Organizations in Antebellum America</b>.  Dr. Salerno answers questions on the history and tactics of female anti-slavery societies as well as how these organizations fit into the larger social movements of the 19th and early 20th centuries.  Unique to this Issue's <i>Perspectives</i> column is an article entitle Blockading the American Confederacy, 1861-185: A Geo-Strategic Analysis by James D. Hardy Jr. and Leonard J. Hochberg, which will later be published in French in a book on the comparative history of blockades by Jean-David Avenal.  Hardy and Hochberg examine the nature and the legal repercussions of the blockade in the Civil War.  David Madden, in his <i>Rediscovery</i> column, reintroduces us to a collection of letters narrated and edited by Catherine S. Crary entitled <b>Dear Belle: Letters from a Cadet and Officer to his Sweetheart, 1858-1865</b>.  Rounding out this Issue and our features is Leah Wood Jewett's <i>Civil War Treasure's</i> column.  Jewett gives us a glance at a Civil War diary by a Texas soldier that confronts loneliness and uncertainty in the midst of war.</p><p>Once again, I must be biding ado to the <i>Civil War Book Review</i>.  I have enjoyed my time as temporary editor.  I would like to thank the reviewers, contributors, and especially the readers of the <i>Civil War Book Review</i> for making my second term as editor rewarding and enjoyable.  We have recently been able to hire my replacement and new steward of the <i>Review</i>, Neal Novak.  Please join me in welcoming Neal.  He is originally from Plano, TX and received his BA in history from Texas A & M University as well as a MA in History from Louisiana State University.  Neal has already assumed the duties as editor and has begun to put together our next issue.  I am certain our publication is in good hands.  </p>		Spring 2006	2006-06-09	Editorial								"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=61 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/cwbrdefault.jpg"">"						
6310			Editorial: <br>The Broad Reach of the Civil War Era		Isenhower, Zach			"<p>Though the temperatures outside fail to reflect it, summer is winding down and another academic year is upon us.  It has been a tremendously productive summer for yours truly, having had the privilege of attending multiple conferences and making strides on my own research in the archives.  One of those conferences was the Society of Civil War Historians meeting in beautiful Chattanooga, Tennessee.  There I enjoyed panels on themes ranging from the Civil War in the Far West to impacts from and on the environment, and also met and caught up with many friends and colleagues in the field.  All of these elements sparking ideas that I hope we at the <i>Civil War Book Review</i> can transmit to our readers. </p>

<p>Our feature reviews this issue take us from the war’s underlying cause—slavery—through the postwar legacies of a professional military and an empowered central government.  Corey Brooks reviews Manisha Sinha’s highly anticipated book, <i>The Slave’s Cause</i>, which highlights the solidarity of abolitionists black and white, elite and middling, throughout the development of their cause.  Sinha argues that they should be interpreted together as radically democratic freedom fighters. </p>

<p><i>Linking the Histories of Slavery</i>, edited by Bonnie Martin and James F. Brooks and reviewed here by Sterling Evans, also examines slavery but from an on-the-ground perspective anchored in the peculiar institution’s borderlands.  This collection of essays puts U.S. slavery in the context of its Cuban and Mexican counterparts, as well as iterations among indigenous societies in the Pacific Northwest.  The resulting volume demonstrates slavery’s diversity as well as its development, as an integral part of the colonial process that created economic prosperity for some and incredible hardship for others. </p>

<p>Taking an alternative view of the causes behind the war, Chad Vanderford’s new book, <i>The Legacy of St. George Tucker</i> analyzes the legal thought behind antebellum states’ rights.  Brent Tarter’s review offers a glimpse of how these first two generations of post-Revolution Americans grappled with the ideas of states’ and the ambiguities built into the federal system.  These thinkers ultimately shaped American intellectual culture in a period of mounting tension. </p>

<p>Unexpected legacies of the war figure heavily in Boyd Cothran’s review of <i>Bone Rooms</i>, by Samuel J. Redman.  Redman explores how the Army Medical Museum and others like it, originally designed to facilitate the study of battlefield injuries, became agents in the postwar formation of racial pseudoscience.  Soldiers left eastern battlefields and fanned out across the Great Plains, carrying instructions to return Native American remains to these museums.  For decades their “specimens"" informed racial pseudoscience, and by extension, ideas about white supremacy and racial hierarchy. </p>

<p>This issue’s author interview moves readers from the borderlands and plains of geography to the chronological borderlands of T.J. Stiles latest book.  <i>Custer’s Trials: A Life on the Frontier of a New America</i> illustrates a portrait of a Civil War figure caught between the nineteenth century culture in which he excelled, and the rapidly modernizing society he helped create.  The book is a refreshing look at a famous subject.  The interview is conducted by the <i>CWBR</i>’s incoming editor, Tom Barber. </p>

<p>I would be remiss to overlook our <i>CWBR</i> stalwarts.  Frank Williams reviews <i>The Annotated Lincoln</i>, edited by Harold Holzer and Thomas A. Horrocks.  Williams finds a meticulous work that provides context from one of the field’s most respected Lincoln scholars, coupled with striking images of primary documents from the sixteenth president.  What emerges is not only Lincoln’s ideas and leadership style, but also his humor and humanity, a needed touch when examining a figure so towering and often mythologized. </p>

<p>Other <i>CWBR</i> stalwarts return as well. LSU Special Collections librarians, Hans Rassmusen and Michael Taylor, exaime how the American Civil War unfolded across the pages of <i>Punch</i>, Britain's leading satirical magazine.</p>  

<p>This issue also kicks off a new series on how studying the issues of the Civil War might serve to better connect the efforts of university and secondary education professionals.  Zevi Gutfreund, who leads a program at Louisiana State University called Geaux Teach, offers one potential model for such a collaborative initiative.  Future columns in this series will explore specific themes in the classroom, from slavery to postwar memory. </p>

<p>Finally, with a tinge of sadness I note that this will be my final issue as editor of the <i>Civil War Book Review</i>.  After a two-year tenure (which I can hardly believe), I have accepted the tremendous opportunity of a Graduate School fellowship to finish out my dissertation at LSU.  I have greatly enjoyed my time at the helm of <i>CWBR</i>, and am confident that the journal can look forward to smooth sailing under Tom Barber’s guidance.  I owe thanks to the excellent staff and administration at Hill Memorial Library and LSU Libraries.  There is no better place than <i>CWBR</i> to get to know the people and scholarship in this huge, exciting field.  It has been a privilege, and fun to boot. </p>

1014			INTERVIEW:<p>Division within the 'solid south': Wallace Hettle untangles antebellum southern politics		McCollum, Charles L.			"<b><i>Civil War Book Review (cwbr): In The Peculiar Democracy, you observe that the antebellum South went from ""a world in which political equality [was] mixed with economic inequality"" to one dominated by an elite affiliated with the Democratic Party. What caused this political shift?</i></b> <br><br><b>Wallace Hettle (wh)</b>: It was perhaps inevitable that a society based on the ultimate form of economic inequality, slavery, would generate a political class based on principles of mastery as much as those of equality. Thomas Jefferson certainly worried about the troubling implications that slavery held for a democratic polity. Since slavery produced ""unremitting despotism"" on the plantation, young men would find it difficult to retain the ""manners and morals"" essential to democracy. Jefferson thought that the habits of mastery developed on the plantation could not be walled off from the rest of society, including the political world. <br><br><b><i>cwbr: You argue that the political legacies of Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson existed in tension within the antebellum Democratic Party. By the time of the Civil War, what were the reasons for the apparent triumph of the Jacksonian tradition? </i></b><br><br><b>wh:</b> Unlike Jefferson, who was fundamentally ambivalent about slavery, Jackson pioneered an effective political style based on mastery and manhood. Jacksonian Democrats continued, as Jefferson had, to celebrate the independence of the yeomanry. But the language of yeoman independence coexisted with practices and discourses that legitimated inequality.<br><br>  In <b>The Peculiar Democracy</b>, I explore those practices and ideas by telling the stories of five Confederate Democrats, whose stories highlight the fragile nature of a democracy in a society shaped by the peculiar institution.<br><br> <b><i>cwbr: Prior to the Civil War, what were the vehicles through which ""encroachments of aristocratic power"" threatened agrarian autonomy?</i></b> <br><br><b>wh:</b> Agrarian independence was as much an idea as a concrete set of political or economic practices. Presented in an idealized form by Democratic theorists such as John Taylor of Caroline, agrarian liberty was in some sense a convenient fiction, based on a romanticized conception of absolute personal autonomy on the part of the yeomanry. <br><br>In my first chapter, I describe the paradoxical manner in which conceptions of yeoman independence were intertwined with the militia system, a social institution based on hierarchy and order. In chapter two, I argue that in the 1850s, rising taxes, high land prices, railroad development, and the growth of commercial agriculture all created a sense of crisis-a belief that yeoman personal independence was endangered by the growth of the market economy. <br><br><b><i>cwbr: You contend that slavery was, to use a modern phrase, the ""wedge issue"" that increasingly divided the plantation aristocracy from the yeoman farmer class. Why weren't the yeoman farmers, and others who owned property but not slaves, able to mount a viable political challenge to the Democratic Party? </i></b> <br><br><b>wh:</b> Slavery and racism both united and divided white Southerners. Shared racial identity held them together, while conflicting economic interests and the exigencies of a war to maintain slavery pulled them apart.<br> That the yeoman farmers never founded an alternative to the slaveholder-dominated Democratic Party should not be surprising, given the paucity of independent organization by rural laborers across the globe in the 19th century. Like other landed ruling classes, slaveholders dominated the intellectual, political, and religious life of their society. By dominating the democratic conversation they set the social agenda. <br><br>Yet slaveholders did feel insecure in the 1850s. Many feared that the election of Lincoln might endanger their political hegemony, creating patronage opportunities for the Republicans and furthering the dissent of non-slaveholders. I believe that such concerns helped speed the South towards disunion.<br><br> <b><i>cwbr: In a recent book, David Williams argued that southern whites were organized into a virtual caste society. Would you go so far?</i></b><br> <br><b>wh:</b> The word ""caste"" seems too static, when in fact the antebellum South's social class structure did allow for both downward and upward social mobility. Democrats such as Jackson and Joseph Brown of Georgia were both upwardly mobile lawyers, who entered the slaveholding class only after achieving professional success. That talented young men could enter the slaveholding class through industry and thrift was a crucial argument to pro-slavery writers who believed that the legitimacy of the slave system rested on the promise of equal opportunity for white men.<br> <br><b><i>cwbr: You condemn southern firebrands, such as the 1860-61 secession crisis spawned, for being increasingly opposed to ""popular Democracy."" But hadn't egalitarianism been considered suspect during much of America's early history, and not just in the South?</i></b> <br><br><b>wh:</b> To me, ""democracy"" simply means a government by the people. In the antebellum South, of course, ""the people"" meant white men. Yet even by those standards, secession witnessed real limitations in popular democracy.<br><br>In the secession crisis, slaveholders had more say than other white men. Control of party machinery such as nominating caucuses, newspapers, and party conventions was absolutely vital in framing debate. While real disagreements occurred, the debate over secession was generally one between members of the slaveholding class advocating competing strategies. Therefore, events such as Georgia's pivotal secession debates at Milledgeville in 1860 featured only speeches by slaveholders. Moreover, some professed yeoman dissidents, such as Georgia's Joseph Brown, were incorporated into the drive for secession. In many ways the process was formally democratic, yet formal democracy coexisted with elite control.<br> <br>In my chapter on Governor Francis W. Pickens of South Carolina's Upcountry, I explore a case where the democratic process breaks down completely in the wake of secession. In that state, legislative apportionment virtually guaranteed planter rule by giving undue weight to the Lowcountry parishes. Still, the state's secession convention stripped Pickens of power, handing it to a planter-controlled executive council. <br><br><b><i>cwbr: Superior political organization and chicanery, you suggest, facilitated the victory of the secessionists. Had a referendum on secession been conducted, is there reason to think that the unionists might have prevailed?</i></b>  <br><br><b>wh:</b> In researching the secession debate, I was struck by the fact that opponents of secession argued for greater deliberation and greater accountability, including popular referenda. They believed that the process should be a democratic one, and convincingly portrayed themselves as the defenders of Jacksonian democracy. By contrast, the secession crisis witnessed fire-eaters, even in relatively egalitarian states such as Alabama, showing remarkably little concern for the voice of the people.<br> It is hard to know what a popular referendum encompassing all the slave states would have produced, and the fire-eaters had no interest in finding out. Certainly results in the Upper South would have looked different than the Deep South. Georgia did pass a referendum on secession, though by a razor-thin margin. But this kind of question, because it is essentially counterfactual, is very difficult to answer precisely. Who would supervise such a referendum? When would it have been held? <br><br><b><i>cwbr: You write that ""fighting in the Civil War became a test of masculinity."" Does this account for why many non-slaveholders fought for the Confederacy (even before forced conscription)?</i></b>  <br><br><b>wh:</b> For many soldiers, the Civil War was a test of manhood. I make this argument in regard to Jeremiah Clemens, Joseph Brown, and John C. Rutherfoord. Of course, it would be absurd to argue that Civil War soldier motivation was solely about gender. A variety of scholars have convincingly explored the ways in which religion, political ideology, and racial identity contributed to soldier motivation. I do believe, however, that Confederate soldiers thought about themselves as men in a culture that equated manhood with violence. <br><br><b><i>cwbr: Let us close with your assessment of the South's collapse. Would you say that political fractures more than military defeats contributed to the Confederacy's defeat?</i></b><br><br>  <b>wh:</b> <b>The Peculiar Democracy</b> is a history of Confederate politics, intended as a corrective to literature that emphasizes the unity of white men in an Old South, ""herrenvolk democracy."" I therefore emphasize politics-especially Jefferson Davis's spectacular failure to articulate a coherent vision for the plain people of the Confederacy-when I discuss the collapse of the South. Although providing an explanation for Confederate defeat has not been my chief concern, I believe that it can best be explained by three related factors: Union military strength, Confederate social and political divisions, and the collapse of slavery.<br><br><br><i>Wallace Hettle, who teaches history at the University of Northern Iowa, challenges the prevailing notion of a unified Southern polity on the eve of the Civil War in The Peculiar Democracy: Southern Democrats in Peace and Civil War. Examining the Democratic Party's ideals and rhetoric from Thomas Jefferson to Jefferson Davis, Hettle addresses how political divisions between agrarian populists and plantation elites weakened the South during a period in which it most desperately needed unity.</i>"		Summer 2001	2001-06-01	Interview								"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=242 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/HettlePeculiarDemocracyInt.jpg"">"						
2279			INTERVIEW:<p>Storytelling and fact-collecting: An interview with author Webb Garrison		Theriot, Katie L.			"<b><i>Civil War Book Review (cwbr): What first attracted you to the Civil War?</i></b><p><b>Webb Garrison (wg):</b> All of my early years were spent in Covington, Georgia, 30 miles east of Atlanta. Though this town was not included in the March to the Sea, Garrard's cavalry burned bridges, gristmills, and the railroad depot during a raid. A vivid childhood memory centers around my grandmother, then 90-plus years old -- tall and gaunt, always dressed entirely in black -- who took sheer delight in telling over and over how as a girl she managed to hide a side of bacon where the Yankees did not find it when they plundered the farm on which she grew up. <p><b><i>cwbr: When did you begin writing? Was history, specifically the Civil War, always a favorite subject?</i></b><p><b>wg:</b> My interest in writing (and publication) began very early. At about age 16 or 17 I was writing a monthly column for a nationally-circulated magazine in the postage stamp field. For quite a long time I wrote primarily for national magazines. <i>Ladies Home Journal</i> was using my ""filler"" vignettes regularly before age 20 -- and was paying $25 per short item, a bundle in those days! Interest in history, as such, began very early -- stemming perhaps from reading everything in the public library that dealt with the ""romantic past"" -- Alexandre Dumas, Captain Frederick Marryat (author of a big series of sea stories), Russian novelists, and some early American works. Later, at Emory University, I was inevitably exposed to Bell Wiley and his classics <i>Johnny Reb</i> and <i>Billy Yank</i> plus lots of unpublished material. <p><b><i>cwbr: Many of your works draw from oral history and anecdotes. How do you research these?</i>.</b><p><b>wg:</b> A great deal of my ""research"" is done in my own files. For years I made extensive notes and filed them by subject any time I ran across something that interested me. When photocopies became readily available, they greatly increased the pace and scope of this process. The result is tens of thousands of pages of source material filed under several thousand topics -- usually with citations about author, title, publisher, and date.<p><b><i>cwbr: Your recent book Friendly Fire in the Civil War (Rutledge Hill Press, ISBN 1558537147, $19.95 hardcover) uncovers instances of what today we would consider accidental casualties. Does the shooting of Stonewall Jackson serve as a prototypical case of how friendly fire accidents often occur from confusion or incompetence? </i></b><p><b>wg:</b> The research technique outlined above accounts for Friendly Fire. Since the term did not exist in 1861-65, it is impossible to search for instances of friendly fire in indices. There may be some other way to do it, but my examples were accumulated as a result of extensive reading over at least 25 years. The shooting of Stonewall Jackson at Chancellorsville is almost universally attributed to firing by North Carolina troops. The Jackson matter is as close to a classic instance of friendly fire in 1861-65 as we have. Yet my daughter-in-law recently raised a really provocative question: ""How do we know positively that the incident was accidental?"" That set a lot of wheels spinning. I wound up with eight possible contributing factors such as Jackson's appearance on a pint-sized horse and his brutal treatment of his officers and men, and I looked at each, resulting in an analysis that leaves it to the reader to decide whether or not Jackson might have been shot on purpose -- α la Vietnam ""fragging."" <p><b><i>cwbr: You have written both on the famous and on ""unusual persons"" of the Civil War. Have you ever come to identify, even against your expectations, with any of the subjects of your research?</i></b><p><b>wg:</b> This sounds crazy, but the Civil War leader with whom I feel the closest affinity is William T. Sherman. I've waded through all five volumes of the <i>Official Records</i> on the Atlanta campaign, plus his home letters and a dozen or more biographies. Sherman may have been the most competent military leader on either side; my strong ""identification"" with him rests largely, however, upon his personal life. He had strong ties with the South and was down on his luck after returning to Union territory. Even though he never got the top command that should have gone to him rather than to Grant, he never once complained about it. I have to differ with him in his racial views, but he's dead center in his thinking about politics and politicians -- as well as news-ravenous correspondents and rank-conscious generals. <p><i>Webb Garrison has published prolifically since his teenage years, selling more than 500,000 copies of books on subjects ranging from the Bible to the Civil War. His newest title, </i>Civil War Hostages<i> (White Mane, ISBN 157249199X, $29.95 hardcover) will appear this spring. </i>"		Winter 2000	1999-12-01	Interview								"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=187 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/WebbGarrison.jpg"">"						
2278			INTERVIEW: <p>A most inhuman tragedy: Roy Morris, Jr. explores Whitman's wartime hospital work		Theriot, Katie L.			"<br><b><i>Civil War Book Review (cwbr): One of your earlier works is on Ambrose Bierce and, now, The Better Angel addresses Walt Whitman's wartime hospital service. Do Civil War literary figures offer a particular attraction to you as a writer and historian? </i></b><p><b>Roy Morris (rm):</b> Coming as I do from an English literature background, I was naturally drawn to the literary aspects of the War, particularly the way in which the War was perceived and recounted by those few writers of note who experienced it firsthand. <p>Not many writers participated in the Warùor lived to tell about it, at any rate. There was Bierce, Whitman, Sidney Lanier, John W. DeForest, John Esten Cooke, and a few others even less well-known today. Mark Twain claimed to have enlisted for a few weeks in a Missouri guerrilla outfit before ""lighting out"" for the West, but no one takes that claim very seriously today. <p>The best writers of the Civil War generationùTwain, Henry James, William Dean Howells, and Henry Adamsùall managed to sit out the War in relative comfort and safety, and from the standpoint of American literature that was probably a good thing. But it's hard not to hold it against them a little bit, particularly when some other very talented writersùFitz-James O'Brien, Theodore Winthrop, and William H. Lytle, to name a fewùall died fighting for the Union, and Sidney Lanier had his life cut short by tuberculosis contracted in a northern prison camp. Who knows how many other potentially great writersùor teachers, doctors, scientists, ministers, or politiciansùdied in the War before they were old enough to make their mark on the world? <p><b><i>cwbr: The Better Angel recounts how Whitman was criticized both during and after the War for fulfilling his civic duty by visiting the sick rather than enlisting. Was Whitman a pacifist or a coward?</i></b><p><b>rm: </b>Thomas Wentworth Higginson, a literary critic who had commanded a black regiment during the War, was the chief critic of Whitman's hospital service, partly because Higginson was Emily Dickinson's personal editor and resented Whitman's higher profile and greater artistic impact. But anyone who spent even a few hours in one of those Civil War hospitalsùmuch less over two years, as Whitman didùimmediately realized that they were more dangerous than any battlefield. The rampant fevers, infections, and communicable diseases killed soldiers three times as often as bullet wounds or cannonballs. You were literally taking your life into your hands to walk into those hospitals. <p>Whitman was certainly no coward, although he freely admitted that he could never imagine himself pulling a pistol or drawing a sword on anyone. He simply found another way to serve the Union, which he devoutly loved, and he paid for his service by contracting a serious hospital fever himself, which led directly to a cataclysmic stroke he suffered a few years after the War was over. <p><b><i>cwbr: Your book vividly describes Whitman's intense emotional connection with wounded soldiers. Was his decision to serve as a nurse influenced by his sexuality?</i></b><p><b>rm:</b> Whitman was almost certainly a homosexual, and he did develop ""crushes"" on a few of the soldiers he met at the hospitals, but that was never the main reason he started making his hospital visits. He simply saw that he could help make a difference, however slight, in the lives of the young soldiers who were suffering and dying far from home, without anyone around to comfort them. As I say in <i>The Better Angel</i>, Whitman didn't go to the hospitals to make romantic conquests, he went to help. And he did. <p><b><i>cwbr: The Better Angel brings to light Whitman's extreme depression at the outbreak of the Civil War. Did the War provide Whitman with a greater sense of purpose?</i></b><p><b>rm:</b> Whitman always said that the Civil War saved his life, which seems like a curious thing to say unless you know something about Whitman's life before the War. He had been going downhillùpersonally and professionallyùfor several years before the War started. He was hanging around with a lot of New York bohemians, drinking too much and writing too little, and his book, <i>Leaves of Grass</i>, wasn't selling many copies. <p>His family life was miserable: one of his brothers was retarded, one was dying of syphilis, another was dying of tuberculosis, his mother was a serious hypochondriacùthere was always some type of melodrama going on in the household. Then, too, he was still recovering from a broken heartùhe had recently split up with a longtime loverùso when the combat began he was ready for a change. <p><b><i>cwbr: The hostilities also seem to have evoked a nationalist spirit in him.</i></b><p><b>rm:</b> That's true. The War gave Whitman a chance to break the vicious cycle he was in by giving him something greater than himself to worry about. He had always been tremendously patriotic, and he saw the Union as an almost mystical entity that had to be preserved at all costs. The main message of <i>Leaves of Grass</i> was freedomùpersonal, political, sexual, artisticùand Whitman truly believed that the American Union was, as his hero Abraham Lincoln said, ""the last best hope of earth."" <p>After the War was over, Whitman never fell into a deep depression again, even after he suffered a series of strokes that left him more or less bedridden for the last two decades of his life. I think he felt that he had fought the good fight, so to speak. He never complained about what it had cost himùphysically, mentally, and emotionally. ""I only gave myself,"" he said. ""I got the boys, I got the<i> Leaves</i>."" <p><b><i>cwbr: Stephen Crane and other writers in the generation after Whitman reached back to the War for literary inspiration. Was their rendering of the War different from those such as Whitman and Bierce who observed it firsthand? </i></b><p><b>rm:</b> Stephen Crane is one of my personal heroes, a true literary genius in the deepest sense of the word, but he was primarily interested in the Civil Warùand war in generalùas a symbol of man's fate in the modern world. As many critics have pointed out, <i>The Red Badge of Courage</i> could be about any warùthere's very little real Civil War in it. It's more a brilliant psychological study than a work of historical fiction. <p>Crane took a more ironic view of the Civil War than Whitman, which was easier for him to do, since he hadn't been around at the time to personally watch young men die by the dozens, as Whitman had. Consequently, Whitman had a more tragic view of the War, which is reflected in his postwar poems, where he adopts a simpler, more direct style of writing to depict the War and its aftermath in a way that his young soldier friends would have immediately understood. <p>Ambrose Bierce, who called Stephen Crane a ""freak,"" was a world-class cynic, but he was never cynical about the Civil War itself, only about the politicians who twisted it around afterwards for their own selfish use. Since Bierce didn't expect much of the world, anyway, he wasn't disillusioned by the Civil War. I think it pretty much confirmed what he thought about life in general: that it was dangerous, capricious, and unfair. <p><b><i>cwbr: Has your own understanding of the War changed after researching Whitman's response to it? </i></b><p><b>rm:</b>Being a Southerner, I grew up with a sense of the Civil War as a noble, tragic affairùthe whole Lost Cause romanticizing. But the more I've studied the War, as an author and magazine editor, the more I've grown to hate it. It seems to me that it was a totally unnecessary waste of human life, with some of the finest young men America had to offer being the first to fall. When Whitman writes about ""the dead, the dead, the dead, our dead,"" I think I know what he means. <p>If I could do nothing else, it would be to remove the whole notion of the Civil War as a romantic, colorful adventure. It was a terrible, and terribly sad, chapter in our national life, and I don't think anything that came out of the Warùnot even the abolition of slavery, which was dying out anywayùwas worth the cost. The great thing about Whitman is that he makes us understand that cost individually, one soldier at a time. He puts a human face on a most inhuman tragedy. <p><i>Katie L.

2281			INTERVIEW:<p>Warrior Women--Soldiers of the Civil War: <br>An interview with DeAnne Blanton and Lauren Cook Burgess		Jewett, Leah W.			"<br><b><i>cwbr: You have a book planned with Louisiana State University Press. Do you have a working title?</i></b> <p><b>DeAnne Blanton and Lauren Cook Burgess:</b> Yes. Because we have found instances of women in military service and engaging in battle throughout all four years of the Civil War, our working title is From Bull Run to Bentonville: Women Soldiers of the American Civil War. We hope that it will be available, appropriately, on the eve of the new millennium, sometime in 2001.<p><b><i>cwbr: When did you first learn about the phenomenon of women soldiers in the Civil War?</i></b> <p><b>db:</b> About eight years ago, I went into the stacks of the National Archives looking for something that a researcher requested. While looking through a War Department reference collection, I found an envelope with ""women soldiers - Civil War"" written on it. It was a file dating from the early 20th century. I was fascinated. I've been independently researching Civil War soldier women ever since. <p><b>lcb:</b> My curiosity about women soldiers grew out of my interest in the life of the common soldier of the Civil War. Over a decade ago, I was reading a number of soldier letters and diaries, as well as classics such as The Life of Billy Yank and The Life of Johnny Reb. I came across several references to women found in the ranks, and was immediately intrigued and fascinated. Researching these women has been an obsession for me ever since. <p><b><i>cwbr: When did you begin working together? How do you divide the research and writing responsibilities?</i></b> <p><b>lcb: </b>I first met DeAnne at the National Archives while working on the Sarah Rosetta Wakeman letters in 1992. As an archivist in 19th Century Military Reference, DeAnne was not only incredibly helpful with the Wakeman research, but she also had amassed quite a bit of information about female soldiers. Our collaboration began right then and there, sharing our lists of sources on soldier women. It wasn't too long after we met that DeAnne proposed that we work together on a history of these extraordinary women and since then we've been working toward that goal. <p><b>db:</b> Lauren and I divided up the research and went to work. Periodically over the years, we've gotten together to share our findings, and talk about what we were learning about Civil War women soldiers. When the time came to write it all down, we developed an outline for the book and divided up the writing responsibilities. We edit each other's chapters, and endlessly discuss interpretations! <p><b><i>cwbr: Is there any particular historian, such as Mary Elizabeth Massey, from whom you draw inspiration? </i></b><p><b>db:</b> I think that Massey deserves much credit for her work, Bonnet Brigades, because it was one of the first ""modern"" works that paid serious attention to women in the Civil War. However, her interpretation of women soldiers is flawed. Massey stated that they were either crazy or prostitutes. Our research disproves this. One of my goals in writing this book is to set the record straight on that account. <p><b>lcb:</b> My ambition for years has been to write a history of the ""common"" woman soldier after the style of Bell Wiley. Wiley's seminal works on the common Civil War soldier have been my inspiration, as have more recent books examining individual's motivations for soldiering, such as James McPherson's For Cause and Comrades. The fact that we have collected a great deal of documentation and information on over 200 women soldiers enables us to pursue a study along these lines. <p><b><i>cwbr: What kind of reception did you receive when you began your research? Had the climate changed in the late 90s when you were searching for a publisher for your book? </i></b><p><b>db & lcb:</b> We've both experienced a range of reactions to our work over the past decade. Many are intensely fascinated by these military women, a good number respond with skepticism and anger, and there is the inevitable sensationalization of the subject. As information about women Civil War soldiers has become more widely disseminated over the years (in middle grades history textbooks, for example), the controversy has diminished somewhat, but rarely do we encounter indifference to the subject. <p><b><i>cwbr: What audience do you envision for your work? </i></b><p><b>db & lcb:</b> We believe that our audience will be quite broad, encompassing Civil War scholars and enthusiasts, those interested in women's studies, and members of the general reading public whose imagination is sparked by the idea of historical women in non-traditional roles. Indeed, these were women who participated in infantry, artillery, and cavalry combat, activities that women in the U.S. armed forces are for the most part prohibited from engaging in today. <p><b><i>cwbr: Why has it taken us so long to be ready, again, to accept the idea of women fighting as men in the Civil War? </i></b><p><b>db & lcb:</b> It's interesting that you should ask that, as we are working now on the chapter that examines just this issue. The answer lies in the changing culturally defined roles for women in our society over the past two centuries, and ironically, the broadening of women's legal and economic status in the 20th century. In 19th century Victorian society, the idea of separate spheres of influence for men and for women was so indelibly entrenched that a few exceptions to the rule that women should interest themselves only in husband, home, and family carried no threat whatsoever to cultural norms. In addition, for several centuries up through the 19th, the fictional literary and even real concept of the ""Female Warrior Bold"" was quite widespread in popular culture. <p>The 20th century has seen big changes for American women. After 72 years of protest and agitation, women finally won the vote in 1920 and had begun to make inroads in the workplace. The cultural backlash to women's expanding legal and economic power came in the 1920s with the popularization of Freudian theories about independent women being neurotic, confused, or crazy, and most likely lesbians. These ideas about independent women who pursue non-traditional careers informed most historians' views of 19th century women soldiers until recently. While society continues to make progress in this regard, cultural taboos about women in combat remain very much intact. <p><b><i>cwbr: How many cases of women disguising themselves as men and fighting have you documented? To put this in proper context, can you give an estimate of women who dressed as men before or after the War, such as Albert DJ Cashier? </i></b><p><b>db & lcb:</b> We have information and documentation about 250 women. We only know of about seven women who dressed and lived as men either prior to the War or afterward. These were women from frontier, immigrant, or agrarian backgrounds, and they did so in order to make an honest living, which was difficult for any unmarried, independent woman to do during that period. <p><b><i>cwbr: How have you gone about researching a subject that has been hidden for so long? What resources proved most helpful? How available are these sources to the general public? </i></b><p><b>db & lcb:</b> The answer to how we have gone about researching this subject is: very patiently and for a very long time. These women enlisted in secrecy, and for the most part, they were very successful in keeping their identities cloaked. When discovered, they would tell military authorities or the press very little about themselves. Researching them is difficult, at best. We are deeply grateful to literally several hundred people from around the world who have, over the years, heard about our research and sent us items of interest (from as far away as Antarctica and Australia). The most helpful resource in documenting women soldiers and their experiences has been the National Archives, closely followed by the U.S. Army Military History Institute at Carlisle Barracks. Plus, women soldiers are mentioned frequently in the diaries and letters that their fellow soldiers wrote during the War. Some of these are published, and others are in archival or private collections around the country. <p><b><i>cwbr: Sarah Morgan of Louisiana often laments in her Civil War era diary that she was not a man and therefore could not join the fight.

What kinds of women were MOST likely to do so? </i></b><p><b>db & lcb:</b> Women from poor, rural, and immigrant backgrounds were most likely to feel no compunction about shifting gender identity to suit their purposes, whether to serve as a soldier or to make a living wage. Many frontier women - and men - seemed to have little or no hesitation about females serving openly in the ranks. As one western soldier remarked in a letter home, ""- some of our best soldiers are of the fair sex. I am told that there are many in Missouri cavalry regiments and they lend a good hand in time of hardship."" <p><b><i>cwbr: Generally speaking, women soldiers did not affect the outcome of the War. So why is it important for us to acknowledge their role? </i></b><p><b>db & lcb:</b> Because they were there. We believe that the women veterans of the Civil War deserve the same honor accorded to their male comrades. Women soldiers not only faced the guns of the adversary, but they also faced the prejudices of their society. Their country did not expect them to fight, yet they did it anyway. Every single woman soldier was a willing volunteer, who went to extraordinary measures to enlist and stay in the army. We feel that such devotion to cause and country is a worthwhile story in itself. <p><b><i>cwbr: No doubt many women soldiers' stories are yet to be discovered, hidden beneath their male person in photographs and letters on public display in collections and museums around the country. Can we hope that corrective measures will take place as more information on the topic is disseminated?

We'll never know how many more women served and failed to make their stories known. We are sure that when this book is published many people who learn about these women for the first time will come forth with new information. In light of growing public appreciation for the role that women played in America's greatest and most bloody conflict, we are quite sure that these warrior women would take pride in having their stories told at this point in time. <p><b><i>cwbr: What do you hope to accomplish with your research? </i></b><p><b>db & lcb:</b> I hope we bring about a new appreciation for and understanding of these heretofore controversial and mysterious figures. They sacrificed and gave their ""last full measure of devotion"" alongside their male comrades, never asking for or receiving any special favor because of their sex. <p><i>DeAnne Blanton is a military archivist at the National Archives in Washington, D.C., specializing in 19th century army records, particularly those of the Civil War.</i><p><i>Lauren Cook Burgess is an independent historian and editor of </i>An Uncommon Soldier<i> (Oxford University Press, ISBN 0195102436, $10.95), the only collection of letters by a Civil War woman soldier known to exist.</i>"		Fall 1999	1999-09-01	Interview								"<img hspace=6 align=LEFT width=161 height=125 alt=""Product Cover"" border=0 src=""/civilwarbookreview/images/jackets/DeAnneBlanton.jpg"">"						
1242			INTERVIEW:<p>Perspectives in History: Gary W. Gallagher probes perceptions of Confederate history		Bates, Bonnie L.			<i><b>Civil War Book Review (cwbr): Which do you find more informative about Lee from an historical standpoint: his military strategy or his writings? </b> </i> <p><b>Gary W. Gallagher (gg):</b> Both afford numerous insights into Lee's military personality. Strategically, he almost always sought to find a way to seize the initiative. He believed that smaller Confederate armies had the best opportunity to offset Union numbers by dictating the action rather than by merely reacting to an opponent's movements. His writings help to explain strategically aggressive campaigns such as his forays across the Potomac River in the autumn of 1862 and the summer of 1863. In each of those cases, Lee sought not only to gain logistical advantages and favorable ground from which to fight battles, but he also hoped to influence northern public morale and politics. Better than almost any of his Confederate or Union contemporaries, he understood-as his writings make abundantly clear-the many intersections between military and civilian affairs, and he knew as well that civilian morale held the key to victory for both sides.<p><i><b>cwbr: On a personal level, which do you find more revealing about Lee: his own writings or what his contemporaries said about him? Do you have any examples?</b></i> </p><p><b>gg:</b> As I stated above, Lee's writings are very revealing. His letters to Jefferson Davis during the 1862 Maryland campaign, for example, tell us a great deal about his motivations, expectations, and frustrations. But he did not reveal everything about why he acted as he did, leaving us in the position of seeking additional information about his operations and his personality elsewhere. One of the best sources for that additional information is the body of written testimony from those who knew and observed him. Edward Porter Alexander's postwar memoir is an excellent case in point. The astute and observant Alexander had the opportunity to see Lee in action through much of the war, and his published recollections offer a number of telling passages about Lee's humor, temper, and enormously audacious approach to warfare.<p><i><b>cwbr: What personal qualities gave Lee his strength as a military leader?</b></i> <p> <b>gg:</b> He had great breadth of vision that enabled him to see the war in its broad context and chart a course that would enable his army to have the greatest possible effect. He could make hard decisions and take full responsibility for them-as he did following the disastrous assaults on July 3 at Gettysburg. He also displayed a very deft touch in terms of personnel, handling a number of crises of command with admirable skill. Finally, he understood that as a soldier he was subordinate to civilian authority-something U.S. Grant also understood but that generals such as George B. McClellan and Joseph E. Johnston either never figured out or simply ignored. The result of Lee's effective leadership was a string of victories in 1862-63 that forged an unshakable bond between him and his soldiers and between his army and the Confederate people.<p><i><b>cwbr: Which of Lee's battles/conflicts do you think has been most misrepresented/misunderstood?</b></i>  <p><b>gg:</b> Almost all of Lee's operations have been studied in great detail. I believe the Seven Days ranks as perhaps the most important of Lee's campaigns, a fact typically lost in the attention lavished on Gettysburg, Antietam, and, to a lesser degree, the Overland campaign. The Seven Days began a striking reorientation of the war in Virginia, giving the Confederate people their first real victory of 1862 (Stonewall Jackson's Valley campaign was a minor affair compared to the Seven Days and would have meant very little had Lee not stopped McClellan's offensive against the Confederate capital) and beginning the process by which Lee would shift the military frontier in the Eastern Theater from the outskirts of Richmond to the Potomac River. I believe too few military accounts of the war have emphasized the full ramifications of the Seven Days. <p><i><b>cwbr: What do you see as the most common misperceptions about Lee?</b></i>  <p><b>gg:</b> One of the most durable misperceptions about Lee is that he was an old-fashioned general who did not understand modern war in the mid-19th-century context. He often is compared unfavorably in this regard with soldiers such as U.S. Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman, Union leaders singled out as forward-looking men who anticipated the direction warfare would take in the 20th century. In fact, Lee understood very well the kind of war in which he found himself, arguing for massive national mobilization, insisting that civilian needs must give way to the requirements of the Confederate military effort, and fully grasping the ways in which his operations influenced morale behind the lines. Another common misperception is that Lee was too much of a gentleman to make hard decisions in respect to subordinates. His smooth style of administrative leadership masked his many decisions that sent officers he considered less than effective out of the Army of Northern Virginia. His removal of Richard S. Ewell in May 1864 stands as one of the most obvious examples of this behavior on Lee's part. <p><i><b>cwbr: Did misrepresentation of Lee begin during the Civil War or only years later? If later, when?</b></i> <p><b>gg:</b> Lee has been misrepresented in various ways from the beginning of the Civil War down to the present. At the time he took command of the army defending Richmond in June 1862, for example, many Confederates criticized him as a timid leader who would never take aggressive action against McClellan. Little did they know just how aggressive Lee would turn out to be. That aggressiveness recently has been put forward as evidence that Lee did not understand how best to wage the Confederacy's war for independence. His offensive generalship cost too many lives, argue modern critics, bleeding the Confederacy at an unacceptable rate. These authors fail to take into account the impact of Lee's admittedly bloody operations on Confederate morale, overlooking the fact that Lee's successes in 1862-63 convinced many Confederates that they had an excellent chance to win independence. That expectation continued among many white southerners as long as Lee and his army were in the field. <p><i><b>cwbr: Do you think revisionist history is a problem throughout Civil War studies, or is it confined mostly to Confederate studies/Lost Cause theory?</b></i>  <p><b>gg:</b> I do not believe revisionist history is a problem at all unless it seeks to overturn sound interpretations simply for the sake of novelty or to make political points. History is a process of constant revision, as each generation of historians and readers looks to the past to find meanings that resonate with their interests. Having said that, I will add that many Lost Cause writers, as well as many of their northern counterparts, wrote with a clear agenda. They hoped to place their actions and their respective causes in the best possible light, often straying far from established facts in the process.		Winter 2002	2001-12-01	Interview														
1002			INTERVIEW:<p>'An inspiration that transcends the ages': James I. Robertson Jr. recasts Stonewall Jackson's biography for young adults		Jewett, Leah Wood			"<i><b>Civil War Book Review (cwbr): Your most recent book is Standing Like a Stone Wall: The Life of General Thomas J. Jackson (Atheneum Press, ISBN 068982419X, $22.00 hardcover). How is Jackson's life relevant to young people today?</b></i><p><b>James I. Robertson jr. (jr):</b> To me, Thomas J. Jackson is an inspiration that transcends the ages. His story is one of an orphan boy who grew up with pitifully little of the familial love so basic to life. By the power of his own will, he moved in 30 years from a shy, reticent child of the mountains to the most esteemed soldier in the world. Jackson's most famous statement, ""You may be what ever you will resolve to be,"" can serve as a beacon for any child of any time. And he achieved all of that through an abiding belief in the power of a Supreme Being. Jackson truly epitomizes St. Paul's statement of a man who ""fought the good fight and kept the faith."" <p><i><b>cwbr: what motivates you to write books on the Civil War for young adults?</b></i><p><b>jr:</b> Although my career as a historian has focused on scholarly examination of Civil War themes, I am a college professor with an increasing concern about the education of younger generations. It is painfully obvious that a large percentage of youngsters today are culturally illiterate. They have little knowledge of such subjects as history, English, and geography because those subjects are so poorly presented in school curricula. This is a dangerous situation; if our children have no culture, we will soon have no history. <p><i><b>cwbr: Is Standing Like a Stone Wall the book you wish you had read as a child?</b></i> <p><b>jr:</b> Good books for young readers were not in abundance during my youth. I was drawn to Civil War history by the writings of Douglas Southall Freeman, Bell Irvin Wiley, Bruce Catton, and Allan Nevins. <p><i><b>cwbr: what challenges did you face writing this book, as opposed to those encountered with Stonewall Jackson: The Man, The Soldier, The Legend (Simon & Schuster, ISBN 0028650646, $19.95 softcover), which is written for an adult audience?</b></i><p><b> jr: </b>A scholarly tome rests on research. A young reader's book also relies on research, but the quality of the narrative must be the strong point. A story not told well is a story of little value or use. <p><i><b>cwbr: Do you think that it is important for professional and academic historians to devote time to children's publications?</b></i><p><b>jr:</b> I realize that I am a voice crying in the wilderness, but I feel it imperative for professional historians to take the time to impart an appreciation of history in young people. If the seeds are not planted early, the yield will be limited. So many Civil War buffs today are additions recruited in adulthood. Had the drama, color, and importance of the Civil War been inculcated at an earlier age, the love of history would have been deeper and America much the better for it. The one element that binds together all Americans is our history."

2280			INTERVIEW:<p>William J. Cooper, Jr. probes Jefferson Davis's character		McCollum, Charles L.			"<i>William J. Cooper, Jr.'s much-anticipated biography of Jefferson Davis characterizes the Confederate president as a dutiful politician who, along with many fellow Southerners, reluctantly deemed secession necessary. A Boyd Professor at Louisiana State University, where he teaches history, Cooper is the author and editor of several earlier works on southern history, including </i>South and the Politics of Slavery and The Conservative Regime: South Carolina, 1877-1890<i>. In this interview, he describes how he approached the biographer's task when writing Jefferson Davis, American and offers insight about the character of his elusive subject.</i><p><b><i>Civil War Book Review (cwbr): In a recent review of a different Jefferson Davis biography, Steven Woodworth commented, ""The Confederate president has somehow inspired what is probably the worst overall body of literature of any great figure in American history."" Did that fact influence your decision to write this biography? </i></b><p><b>William J. Cooper, Jr. (wc):</b> I think overall that sentiment is correct, and there are reasons for that. One is that after the War there were fierce partisans on either sideùeven among professional historians, Davis was such a divisive figure that people either detested or adored himùso any semblance of objectivity was lacking in almost all cases. <p>In the 20th century, the problems changed. The fact that the Confederate experience was looked upon as a military struggle led people away from writing about the politicians. They were considered peripheral figures, impeders of the war effortùwith Jefferson Davis seen as the chief impeder. Also Davis's long and complicated life contributed to the problem. Frankly, I think many were frightened off by his complexity. My interest in Davis is longstanding, and the fact that there weren't many good biographies led me to give it a try.<p><b><i>cwbr: The choice of the word ""American"" in your title is backed up by the emphasis of the book: two-thirds is devoted to Davis's life before and after the Civil War. Why did you choose to emphasize these periods of his life?</i></b><p><b>wc:</b> I wanted to write a whole life of the manùhe was more than president of the Confederacy. From my point of view, one can not understand how Davis conducted himself as president unless one grasps what he was like before the War. There was a dissonance in his attitude that I think is important to realize in understanding his actions as president. <p>Secondly, after the War he lived 24 years, quite a long time. To devote scant attention to that is unfair to him. His complete career patterned so much of what was happening to the South. He became the living embodiment of the Lost Causeùwhich is so crucial in understanding the history of the South after the Civil War. Even more importantly, though, the views Davis articulated about region, race, and nationality became the accepted views of much of the white South. For that reason, I think his later years merited that much attention. <p>Back to my choice of title, I think Davis consciously thought of himself as an American. He never thought of himself as rebelling from America; he believed secession in 1861 was the only way to ensure that the original intent of the Founders would not be usurped by the upstart Republicans. And, after the War, he talked about the glory of American nationalism and about how pleased he was that the sections were reuniting. <p><b><i>cwbr: In Jefferson Davis, American, you state that one of your goals is ""to understand Jefferson Davis as a man of his time, not to condemn him as not being a man of my time."" Can you explain what you mean by this?</i></b><p><b>wc:</b> If we analyze Davis through present-minded eyes, we just end up with condemnation rather than historical understanding. Though no one in his right mind can now condone what Davis believed in regard to the superiority of the white race and the value of slavery, one has to examine him as a man of his timeùa time in which his views weren't at all extreme. I wanted to make it clear that Davis merits our best efforts to objectively understand him.<p><b><i>cwbr: Davis is commonly perceived today as having been cold, arrogant, and stubborn. In the biography, however, you show that he could be a warm and friendly man. </i></b><p><b>wc:</b> You have to look at Davis before 1860 and Davis after 1860. Before 1860 he was a successful professional politician and was accomplished at doing the things they had to do, such as appealing to constituents, mingling with the crowds, and getting along with his colleagues in Congress. <p>But when the War came, his whole view of reality changed. Now he had embarked on a holy crusade because the United States had somehow failed and his Confederacy couldn't be allowed to fail as well. Success was so important to him that every man was expected to give all he had to the effort. If Davis ever detected what he perceived as a personal motive (or, one might even say a human motive) coming before duty, then he became an austere and cold person. Unlike Lincoln, Davis couldn't accept the human comedy during the War, even though he did have a very warm personal side. <p><b><i>cwbr: Throughout your study, Davis's devotion to the concepts of strict constructionism and states' rights are illustrated. Yet during the War, Davis strayed from this philosophy and at times defied the Confederate Constitution. Can you explain these seeming inconsistencies?</i></b><p><b>wc:</b> Davis would not have seen this as inconsistent. The Confederacy was at war and since defense was the government's responsibility it could do things that would have been seen as reprehensible in peacetime. Additionally, Davis became so utterly committed to the Confederate cause that he could not conceive of its failure. As such, he did whatever he could in his power (constitutional or not) to defend the country, including freeing and arming of some of the slaves toward war's end. For him the cause superseded his philosophical stands on government. <p><b><i>cwbr: To what do you attribute his utter conviction about the Confederacy? Was it intellectual?</i></b><p><b>wc:</b> I think it is mostly emotional and psychological, which becomes intellectual. When the antebellum country and values he so cherished disappeared, it was a crushing blow to him. Now the Confederacy couldn't fail. The old politics he had mastered had failed to save the Union and he believed it would take something else to save the Confederacy. So his devotion became total to this cause and he felt that the same intense dedication needed to be shared by everyone else if this venture were to succeedùand it couldn't fail! What he had difficulty facing was that most Confederates didn't have this superhuman level of conviction.<p><b><i>cwbr: Here you hint at the willpower of the South. Some scholars have argued recently that southern defeat resulted from internal dissention and weak patriotism. Other historians, such as Gary Gallagher, contend that the Confederacy faltered because of the Union's military triumphs in the field and superior numbers. Which of these competing explanations strikes you as the most accurate?</i></b><p><b>wc:</b> I think the Confederates did not come apart internally; they were beaten by the unrelenting advance of the Union, not by themselves. Confederate soldiers did desert the ranks, but this was not due to a lack of commitment. Most of them left in order to return home to protect their families as the enemy was, in most cases, already there towards the end of the War. This does not mean they were predestined to lose.<p><b><i>cwbr: So you don't subscribe to the Lost Cause theory?</i></b><p><b>wc: Not at all. It was a long shot, and perceptive Confederate leaders like Davis knew that, but there were many times when things could have gone either way on the battlefield which easily could have changed the outcome of the War.</b><p><b><i>cwbr: You describe Davis as being not so much an indecisive man, as one who thoroughly thought over his decisions before making themùperhaps at the expense of expediency. Did this style of leadership compromise his presidency and the Confederate cause as a whole?</i></b><p><b>wc:</b> I do not think this attribute adversely affected the outcome of the War. When it came down to it, Davis was more than capable of making difficult decisions and he could do them in a timely fashion. An example: his handling of the decision to support Lee's second invasion of the North in 1863 over sending troops to assist Johnston and Pemberton on the Vicksburg front. He made no rash decision, as he held a two-day cabinet meeting and, responding to the pleas of the postmaster general, even reconsidered, before affirming his decision. By taking a reasonable amount of time on this issue, Davis made the correct choice, as supporting Lee's plan to invade the North was the only sensible option, in my judgment. And it certainly didn't cause the defeat at Gettysburg. <p><b><i>cwbr: Is there a single decision that sticks out in your mind as being Davis's worst? </i></b><p><b>wc:</b> Davis horribly mishandled the Army of Tennessee after the Kentucky campaign of 1862. Things that he should have done and things he refused to do led to disaster in that area. I can understand some of what he didn't do, but his decision in 1863 to leave Bragg in command after he personally inspected the situation was arguably the worst decision he made as president of the Confederacy. <p><b><i>cwbr: What ought to be Davis's enduring historical legacy? </i></b><p><b>wc:</b> When you look at Davis you see the great difficulties America had trying to cope with the massive changes that took place in the 19th century. Here is a man who tried to deal with them as best he could. He desperately tried to hold on to values and ideals that in the end were not going to prevail, but he kept his faith in what he believed.

1181			INTERVIEW:<p>Immortal Image: Harold Holzer reflects on representations of Lincoln		Bates, Bonnie L.			"<p><b><i>Civil War Book Review (cwbr): What inspired you to re-release </i>The Lincoln Image<i> (University of Illinois Press, ISBN0252026691, $30.00 hardcover), 16 years after its original publication?</i></b><br><br><b>Harold Holzer(hh):</b> For years my co-author and good friend, Gabor Boritt, has been trying to arrange a reprint of this book. Professor Boritt, who teaches at Gettysburg College, noted a steady increase in requests for the title. The book went out of print years ago, and the original publisher lost the plates. We had to wait for new techniques that allowed illustrated books to be copied without the original plates or film. We appreciate the irony here: it took new picture technologies to facilitate the re-appearance of this study of old picture technologies. And it took the enthusiasm of the University of Illinois Press.<br><br><b><i>cwbr: How does The Lincoln Image fit in with the two other books that you have collaborated on with Gabor Boritt and Mark Neely Jr.?</i></b><br><br><b>hh:</b> <i>The Lincoln Image</i> was our first effort to focus attention on these rather forgotten sources of history. We planned the sequel as a further exploration. Later, we did a long piece for the Winterthur Portfolio on the European image of Lincoln-also conceived as part of our ongoing look at Lincoln iconography. Finally, we did <i>The Confederate Image</i> (University of North Carolina Press, ISBN 0807849057, $27.95 hardcover). I can't say that we sat down 18 years ago and plotted out a series of five books. We inspired ourselves, and were encouraged by others, along the way. Last year, Mark E. Neely Jr. and I came out with yet another study, <i>The Union Image</i> (University of North Carolina Press, ISBN 0807825107, $45.00 hardcover), which is a companion book of sorts to The Confederate Image. Thirteen years and many other projects separated them; it was one of our readers, George Craig of the Civil War Round Table of New York, who said we had to do that book. Mark and I looked at each other and said: why didn't we think of that? <br><br><b><i>cwbr: Which of the many representations of Lincoln do you find most appealing from an artistic standpoint? What about from an historical one? Is there an image you consider especially influential?</i></b><br><br><b>hh:</b> From an artistic standpoint I have always loved G.P.A. Healy's painting, a dignified but animated profile, captured him beautifully on the cusp between his candidacy and his presidency, between frontier vitality and Civil War-era sorrows. Of course the old five-dollar bill portrait-that is, the photo that inspired it, and inspired hundreds of adaptations-had a big impact. It was made at Mathew Brady's studio on February 9, 1864, just a few days before Lincoln's 55th birthday. Robert Lincoln thought it was the best picture ever made of his father. From a historical point of view, the most influential was Francis B. Carpenter's painting of the first reading of the Emancipation Proclamation. It was adapted into a best-selling print that stayed in circulation for generations, and brilliantly celebrated the most important act of the Lincoln administration. For direct influence, Carpenter wins every time for his emancipation and family scenes. The day Lincoln hired Carpenter as a virtual artist-in-residence was a major turning point in the making of Lincoln's reputation. Lincoln could not have done better had he hired the most expensive public relations counselor of the 21st century. I think Lincoln at least suspected something important was being produced, or else he would not have granted Carpenter as much time as he did. <br><br><b><i>cwbr: How did this imagery affect the attitudes of the American public?</i></b><br><br><b>hh:</b> There is no question that Lincoln needed to be introduced to the electorate in 1860. He was all but unknown when he was nominated for the presidency. Rumors about his homeliness were not helping him. Engravers and lithographers, often using the work of period photographers as models, helped make Lincoln palatable as a candidate, and also transformed him into an icon that symbolized limitless American opportunity-the rail-splitter who had risen to his full potential under our unique system. Later, pictures helped transfigure Lincoln yet again into Father Abraham, the Great Emancipator, and the martyr to the Union he helped save. We know how highly Americans regarded these seemingly primitive pictures. They placed them in the most sacred spots in their homes: above the mantel in the parlor. I don't have proof that anyone ever said, ""I'm voting for Lincoln because of that terrific picture!"" But who among modern Americans will admit he chose a candidate because of a fabulous TV commercial? <br><br><b><i>cwbr: Do you think Lincoln images changed the public's view of him as an individual or as a politician?</i></b><br> <br><b>hh:</b> They provided strong reinforcement of both images: private and public. The racist cartoons that appeared during the 1864 presidential campaign reflected, and perhaps influenced, the deep divisions within the American electorate about the cause of Emancipation. The artist Carpenter also popularized the family image of Lincoln. Such pictures suggested to many Americans haunted by Lincoln's wartime sacrifices that he had somehow enjoyed the comforts of home during those brutal days. The image may have been exaggerated, but it was undeniably powerful and is still with us: we continue to debate Lincoln's claim to the title of the Great Emancipator, and the cult of the First Family remains as powerful as ever.<br><br><b><i>cwbr: A number of the works were reissued repeatedly, updated occasionally with the addition of a beard, for example. Was this a common practice at the time?</i></b><br><br><b>hh:</b> It had been done before, but Lincoln and American printmaking more or less came of age together, and the practice grew exponentially during the Civil War. Prints of old Mexican War-era heroes were reissued with new heads; beardless pictures of men like Lincoln, Lee, and Jackson were updated. One publisher in Ohio issued about 50 portraits of Union military heroes, utilizing only five or six bodies, on which were grafted interchangeable portraits to meet regional sales demand. The most politically incorrect example is probably that of the John C. Calhoun portrait that morphed into a Lincoln portrait, flowing robes and all, Unionist replacing secessionist.<br><br><b><i>cwbr: How did representations of Lincoln change from election to assassination?</i></b><br><br><b>hh:</b> Once he won, he changed his image by growing whiskers. Printmakers responded by issuing more avuncular and dignified portraits, which depict a man more prepared to lead a nation in crisis than the log cabin-born rail-splitter. Actually, once the war began, the public clamored less for Lincoln pictures than for those of new military heroes like McClellan. Lincoln only regained pictorial prominence with the Emancipation Proclamation and his decision to run for re-election in 1864. But once he was martyred, there was an explosion of demand for pictures: heroic portraits, deathbed scenes, even retrospective pictures that suggested he was an active military leader. Perhaps the best example of this iconographical transformation can be found in pictures showing Lincoln side-by-side in a kind of imaginary secular afterworld with George Washington-the father and savior of the country together. No one had ever been portrayed as Washington's equal. Such prints elevated Lincoln to the status of American deity. <br><br><b><i>cwbr: The book includes both early photographs and non-photographic illustrations. Within decades, photographs would subsume most other forms of representation. From the perspective of art history what significance do you ascribe to this phenomenon?</i></b><br><br><b>hh:</b> Americans thirst for change, and I'm not sure such evolutions have or require a rationale based on art history. People stopped displaying prints on their walls when wall calendars came into vogue and sort of cheapened the genre. Carte-de-visite photos yielded to cabinet photos and ultimately to the Kodak revolution, after which family pictures became more important than celebrity pictures. I'm not sure whether any American political hero has been showcased in family parlors since the death of Kennedy. But Jennifer Lopez and Tiger Woods are alive and well on posters in our teen-agers' bedrooms, I'm reliably informed. Then again, most young people these days get images off the World Wide Web. So there have been technological and sociological revolutions conspiring to subsume the antique world of prints.<br><br><b><i>cwbr: Are there any plans for an exhibition of Lincoln images?</i></b><br><br><b>hh:</b> When we first issued The Lincoln Image, we curated a companion exhibition of prints that ran at the Lincoln Museum, Gettysburg College, and all sorts of venues-Chicago, Providence, and other places. And just a few years ago, the Lincoln Museum asked me to serve as guest curator for a show of Lincoln paintings and sculpture from life. I would love to do another exhibit and perhaps a TV documentary. These pictures are more than mere illustrations; they are pieces of history, and it's well worth reminding ourselves of the influence they once wielded. Lincoln once looked at a new sculpture and said: ""There is the animal himself."" And what an influence the Lincoln animal himself, and his face, had."

When I visited the battlefields, and began to feel the impact of these sacred places, I was hooked.<br><br> <b><i>cwbr: What drove you to continue this project in spite of delays?</i></b><br><br><b>ajm:</b> Early results are often disappointing. An experienced researcher, writer, or artist is aware of this and expects frustrations. A valuable lesson may be gleaned from the stonecutters who built the great cathedrals. The stone is not ""cut"" from one mighty blow but instead, from slow, repeated strikes. I am grateful to historian William J. Cooper Jr. and novelist David Madden for their encouragement throughout this project.<br><br><b><i>cwbr: You describe the battlefields as alternately emanating ""ghostly energy,"" tragedy, and a ""healing"" essence. How did you capture these feelings?</i></b><br><br><b>ajm:</b> Musicians know how to play with more feeling when asked. As a photographer, I am sensitive to the energy and echoes from the past in the places I photograph, but I can't explain how I manage to capture them on film. But I do recognize when it happens. For example, the ghostly light in the photograph of the Hornet's Nest and Sunken Road at Shiloh has an ethereal quality that hovers over the dark battlefield. In contrast, the photographs of the Sunrise over the Valley of Death, Gettysburg, and Sunlight, Sky, and Trees near the Bloody Pond, Shiloh, have a healing presence for me. The overall sepia treatment of the photographs in this book also helps to wrap the viewer in the haunting memory of history.<br><br><b><i>cwbr: What is the landscape of war telling us, and why should we listen?</i></b><br><br><b>ajm:</b> I was surprised to see that many of the park visitors are veterans. Now there is peace and contemplation where once there was death and destruction. Standing there on the battlefields I became aware of the terrible price of freedom.<br><br><b><i>cwbr: How can your photographs aid battlefield preservation efforts?</i></b><br><br><b>ajm:</b> Western photographer William Henry Jackson was the first to photograph Yellowstone. It was partly because of these photographs that the National Park Service was born. Clarence John Laughlin through his photographs and book, Ghosts Along the Mississippi, was instrumental in bringing awareness that led to restoring the antebellum homes along the river in Louisiana. These are powerful documents that preserve a moment in time that may change and influence for or against a cause. And what better cause than to honor all Americans who gave ""the full measure of devotion"" to their principles and their country?<p><i>A. J. Meek is a professor of art at Louisiana State University.

1348			INTERVIEW:<p>Theater of War: Capturing battle in film and fiction<br> An interview with Ron Maxwell and Jeff Shaara		Ng, Laura			"<p>Facts reveal battle strategies, political maneuvering, and casualty lists that give us the details of war. But it is the fictional accounts produced over the past 130 years that convey the intimate, human moments that pierce our hearts and illuminate our imaginations.<p> The novel--and in modern times, the film--speak to our souls in ways that no other medium can. <i>Gone with the Wind, The Horse Soldiers, Glory</i>: these timeless stories continue to resonate with us because they breathe life into the ghosts whom we know, through faded ink on yellowed pages, once existed. Ironically, fiction made flesh makes us eager for the facts, which are now more meaningful.<p>There is a delicate art to the recreation of reality in novel and cinematic form. Writers and directors dance along the thin line between truth and interpretation, recycling history to create a product for broad public consumption. Filmmaker Ron Maxwell and novelist Jeff Shaara share their experiences of interpreting war and creating memorable characters through the new film Gods and Generals (Warner Brothers, Fall 2002) based on Shaara's 1996 novel of the same title.<p>- Leah Wood Jewett, United States Civil War Center <p><h5>Ron Maxwell: The view from behind the camera</h5><p>Ronald F. Maxwell is writer/director of Gods and Generals, which recently completed filming in Maryland, West Virginia, and Virginia. It stars Robert Duvall as Robert E. Lee, Jeff Daniels as J.L. Chamberlain, Mira Sorvino as Fanny Chamberlain, and Steven Lang as T.J. Jackson. It will be released by Warner Bros. in theaters in December 2002.<p><i><b>Civil War Book Review (cwbr): What are your thoughts on a film's role in telling accurate history, perpetuating (or tearing apart) a contested public memory, or providing entertainment?</b></i><p><b>Ron Maxwell (rm):</b> This screenplay for Gods and Generals, although faithful to the structure of Jeff Shaara's novel (Ballantine, ISBN 0345422473, $7.99, softcover) and its main characters, has taken on a life of its own. These distinctions are in characterization, dialogue, and cinematic storytelling. I felt compelled to include the stories of Afro-Virginians and Virginia women who figured in the historical events covered in the film, and who could illuminate the story in unique ways, revealing other facets of the ""generals"" as well as offering a richer tapestry of the times. Jim Lewis joined Jackson's staff in the fall of 1861 as his personal cook and valet. Although inconclusive, the scant evidence about him suggests he was a free man of color, and that is how I have chosen to portray him. He stayed close to Jackson to the end. I hope to illuminate his relationship with the general, shedding light on southern blacks who found themselves caught up with those who fought for the cause of secession. <p>In doing my research for the screenplay, I came across the journal of Jane Howison Beale, who lived in Fredericksburg through the war years and was present, with her children, during the siege and battle of Fredericksburg. Neither Anna Jackson nor Fanny Chamberlain endured a rival experience, and I deemed it important to see the war from the aspect of a civilian, a woman, who found herself momentarily at its epicenter. <p>As is always the case when delving into the facts, wonderful coincidences emerged. The Reverend Beverly Tucker Lacy was both her pastor and Jackson's wartime chaplain. The Beale family also provided me with the opportunity to introduce Roberta Corbin of Moss Neck Manor, where the Confederate army would winter in the early months of 1863, Jackson would meet Mrs. Corbin's enchanting five-year-old daughter Jane, and where Sandy Pendleton, Jackson's youthful aide, would encounter his future wife Catherine Corbin. <p>One story opened up into another, characters miraculously crossed paths, some would escape harrowing circumstances, some would die suddenly from a fever. Altogether, the women began to provide the story with a dimension that put the battles and combat in relief, and which made the soldiers themselves more human, more vulnerable. The American Civil War is as much a saga of the home front as the front lines and with this film I wanted to make that connection better known. <p>Jeff Shaara's book is great reading. To be sure there is lots of warfare, but in some measure the book is successful because he takes you through long passages of the characters' thoughts or describes their inner lives. In film much of this needs to be externalized. Silent passages or musical interludes can be effective, as are the voice overs of thoughts. But at the end of the day, character is largely revealed through dialogue and action, especially if the characters are inherently loquacious and sometimes eloquent. <p>Everyone knows that dialects vary within linguistic groups--by region, by ethnicity, by education, and by distinct localized influences. This was no different at the time of the American Civil War. In Gettysburg the characters spoke in eight studied dialects. <p>In <i>Gods and Generals</i>, the same attention to linguistic fidelity remains and introduces the audience to both whites and blacks with little or no formal schooling. It is challenging to write dialect on to the page. But it is important, as a guide to both the reader and the actor who will eventually interpret the role. It must be stressed that these rural dialects do not imply ignorance or stupidity∙they are not meant as stereotypes. The writing of dialect in a script is crude at best. It is intended only as an indication of regional and social distinction. <p>It is the job of skilled actors to bring these characters and their speech to vital and convincing reality. The folksy rural patois and vocabulary of both blacks and whites is contrasted to the more educated of both races, as exemplified by Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain or Frederick Douglass. As was the case on the set of Gettysburg, a linguistic dialect coach worked with the cast to discover the actual speaking ""solutions,"" which became organic and invisible touches of character, in contrast to the seeming heavy-handedness of the written word on the page. <p><i><b>cwbr: What responsibility does a director have when tackling a historic subject, either via production of a documentary or a feature film?</b></i> <p><b>rm:</b> Ernest Gellner wrote, ""Anything must be true before it can significantly claim other merits. Without truth, all else is worthless."" Poetic license is the art of what might have been. Not a snapshot, it is more like a retrieved memory, an illumination. It is a window opened to reality. When we read Victor Hugo or Leo Tolstoy, we know it is fiction we are reading, not history, but we are convinced of its authenticity, its honesty, its rigorous conception of what ""might have been, what could have been."" Poetic license is not an excuse for sloppiness and slip-shod research, it does not provide authorization to make it all up. Poetic license is not a hunting license to kill truth. <p>Filmmakers, playwrights and novelists, like historians, are fiercely preoccupied with the truth--poetic, dramatic and historical. When it rings true it is believed. When truth is rendered with artistry, it yields <i>War and Peace</i>, <i>Les MisΘrables</i>, <i>The Gods Will Have Blood</i>. Through these novels we know the French Revolution as well or better than we know it from historical works. <p>The Civil War was a brutal episode in our history. A half million were killed or wounded. Tens of thousands were made refugees. The suffering was beyond our reckoning. Individual heroism and courage, duty and honor, only make sense in the context of these trials and tribulations. I have not shied away from either in the screenplay for <i>Gods and Generals</i>. The last thing the world needs is a mindless, glossy entertainment on the Civil War. So it is important to accept the seriousness of this challenge: to keep our eyes wide open, to be relentlessly honest, to refrain from perpetuating myth and folklore--to get to the truth of the matter. Nothing will be more dramatic and nothing will be more worthwhile. <p><i><b>cwbr: What is one of the best Civil War films that you have ever seen? The most influential? The most unfairly neglected or dismissed?</b></i> <p><b>rm:</b> By the time of the firing on Fort Sumter in 1861, a gruesome prologue was already underway in Missouri and Kansas. May 24, 1856, was the night that John Brown's self-named Army of the Lord hacked, shot, and stabbed a grisly human swath along Pottawatomie Creek. What followed and continued nearly unabated until even after the collapse of the Confederacy were events and atrocities most uninformed Americans would more readily associate with Kosovo than with the good ol' USA. It is in this uncertain and dangerous world that <i>Ride With the Devil</i> is set. The film takes an unflinching look at the brutality from both sides and refreshingly refrains from sweeping moral judgments. Free of pandering to clichΘd expectations and the constraints of a politically correct point of view (such as, the Confederates defended the institution of slavery, therefore any atrocity committed by Yankees is justifiable and even heroism on the part of Rebels is despicable) the film can explore deeper, more complex themes. <p><i>Ride With the Devil</i> examines a tragic subject without being a tragedy. We follow a small group of Sesech partisans across battles, witnessing through their eyes the unpredictable violence, the vulnerability of civilians, and the total war of guerrilla armies. But at its heart, amid all this mayhem and death, friendship, loyalty and generosity survive∙even a sense of humor. And, without giving away the ending, there is metamorphosis and resurrection. <p><i>Ride With the Devil</i> captures the authenticity of the character in time and place, and therefore tells a story we are willing to believe. This is classic filmmaking with a sure and steady hand. It's that rare Hollywood event, a story of substance told with genuine artistry. The first thing the filmmakers got right was the jargon. These characters talk like they couldn't be from anywhere else but mid-19th-century America. Nearly all Hollywood historical films get the sets and costumes right, and this film is no exception, but rarely do they capture the moral universe, the defining idiosyncrasies of peoples who lived in their own particular times. Human life is universal, but it is always expressed in individual ways. Sometimes the movies really do reflect the mystery and contradictions of human existence. Sometimes friendship and personal loyalty trumps ideology and politics. Sometimes it doesn't. <i>Ride With the Devil</i> is not only first-class entertainment. It's a liberating experience. <p><h5>Jeff Shaara: The writer's perspective</h5> <p>Son of Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Michl Shaara, Jeff Shaara is the author of <i>Gone for Soldiers</i> (2000), <i>The Last Full Measure</i> (1998), and <i>Gods and Generals</i> (1996). His latest novel, <i>Rise to Rebellion</i> (2002), deals with the American Revolution. <p><b><i>Civil War Book Review (cwbr): When you write an historical novel such as </i>Gods and Generals<i>, the process entails taking facts, weaving them into your view of events, and publishing the interpretation for public consumption. The filmmaking process transforms that vision yet again. What do you find compelling about this process? Which aspects of the story are best explored through the novel, the film, and through non-fictional accounts? Does the story lose or gain anything in the translation from one form to the other?</i></b> <p><b>Jeff Shaara (js):</b> For me, the most compelling aspect of writing historical fiction is telling the story from the points of view of various significant historical figures. The challenge is to find the means to get inside their minds, and tell the story as they might have told it. It is a risky thing to put words in the mouths of characters such as Robert E. Lee or George Washington. But when I have completed the research and I feel as though I know these people on a deeply personal level, then the storytelling is fun for me. I feel I'm seeing the events through the eyes of the people who created the history. It's far different from writing what most people would call a history book. <p>I'm not an historian, and I'm not bound by the restraints that most historians feel they must operate under. As a storyteller, my goal is to entertain. However, when dealing with real events and real characters, I have a responsibility to get it right. I believe that when history is accurately portrayed, it is the characters who bring it to life. From what I hear from readers, this approach makes for a much more interesting look at an historical event. <p>By definition, dialogue, both spoken and internal, is what makes my books fictional. But through the dialogue, and through the points of view of the characters, the reader can come to understand much more about why and how the history occurred, far beyond what that reader can get from the facts and figures of nonfiction history. I hear from an enormous number of people who express their appreciation for the fictional approach. That, of course, further increases my responsibility to tell a story as accurately as possible. <p>I believe a film can go a step further, by bringing to the audience a visual image that they might not get from a novel. This isn't always the case, and if I've done my job as a writer, I should be painting a good visual picture as well. The disadvantage for the filmmaker is staying inside the mind of the character that's pretty tough to do when you're working in a visual medium. (The technique that filmmakers use to deal with that is a voice-over∙which a good filmmaker will tell you is a pretty clumsy tool.) <p>To give due credit to nonfictional accounts, the responsibility of the historian is to present the facts. If the historian does his or her job, the reader should come away with a fairly complete idea of what happened. But it's the why that gets historians into trouble. I'm told often that historians don't engage in opinion or interpretation. I believe that's a ridiculous claim. One good example is Robert E Lee. There are so many nonfiction interpretations of the man and his accomplishments, each one championed by a particular historian as the correct view, that it throws doubt on the entire notion of the historian as strictly the fact keeper. Any controversial historical figure is subject to interpretation, and I find it rather interesting that historians will debate the merits of Thomas Paine or Nathan Bedford Forrest, while claiming to tell only the truth. Each generation has its own truth, and this applies to historians as well as anyone else. <p>What is lost by moving from one medium to another is in the eye of the beholder. Many people would rather see a film than read a book. Others consider the book to be far superior to anything that can be put on film. The historian will tell you that objectivity is lost when an historical account is related by a novelist. (I disagree.) Naturally, the novelist, filmmaker, and historian can each bring a particular contribution to the same account. What works for the audience is, ultimately, all that matters."

5910	9780813146928	$45.00	Kentucky Confederates		Craig, Berry			"<p>In <i>Kentucky Confederates: Secession, Civil War, and the Jackson Purchase</i>, Berry Craig explains why western Kentucky, or the Jackson Purchase, was novel during the Civil War: despite the predominance of pro-Unionism across the state, the Purchase was staunchly pro-Confederate. The Purchase’s fidelity to the southern cause was so well known that it earned the region the sobriquet “the South Carolina of Kentucky"" (1).  Craig argues that despite the Confederate army’s withdrawal from the region in 1862 and the lack of statewide support for secession, pro-Confederate sentiment remained vibrant in the Purchase. For example, from 1861-1865, about 5,000 men from the Purchase enlisted in the Confederate army, while only 850 joined federal forces. Those who remained in the region joined roving bands of Confederate guerillas who attacked pro-Unionists and their families with virtual impunity and received food, weapons, and other support from local civilians. In order to subdue the region, occupying federal forces declared martial law, implemented loyalty oaths, and infamous Brigadier General Eleazer A. Paine wrought a so-called “reign of terror"" by banishing Confederate sympathizers and their families to Canada and even ordering the execution of some suspected guerillas (261). However, all of these tactics proved futile. Purchase residents sustained faith that a gray-clad army would emerge victorious and liberate them from the Yankee invaders. </p>
<p>Craig begins by explaining how early patterns of settlement, trade, religion, and geography caused the Purchase to gravitate toward the Confederacy. Separated from the rest of Kentucky by the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers, geography determined that many of the region’s early settlers migrated either from West Tennessee or points further south. Successive generations clung to the proslavery evangelical Protestantism their ancestors brought with them.  The eight counties that compose the region were linked closely to the South via communities such as Hickman, Columbus, and Paducah which maintained bustling river and rail commerce with Memphis, Nashville, and New Orleans. And as Kentucky’s overall slave population declined after 1830, the Purchase’s reliance on slave labor increased, especially for tobacco production, which by 1850 was highly profitable. </p>  
<p>In many ways, the Purchase shared common social and cultural traits with the lower South which partly explains the region’s adherence to the southern cause. But, Craig’s primary focus for understanding pro-secessionist sentiment is through an exhaustive examination of the region’s politics which had been heavily Democratic since the 1830s even though the rest of the state had been a bastion of Henry Clay and the Whigs. In the 1860 presidential election, the Purchase went to proslavery, southern Democratic candidate John C. Breckinridge, while the remainder of the state voted for John Bell and the Constitutional Union party. After the firing on Fort Sumter and Lincoln’s call for seventy-five thousand volunteers, the Kentucky General Assembly declared the state neutral which prompted Purchase Democrats to indefatigably agitate for secession throughout the war. According to Craig, no other region of a loyal slave state advocated for secession. For example, in May 1861, U.S. Congressman Henry C. Burnett and other secessionists met at the now forgotten Mayfield convention to discuss possibilities of the region creating either a military alliance with or annexing to western Tennessee to create a new Confederate state. Ultimately, the delegates declined secession because they falsely believed that the rest of Kentucky would eventually secede once they fully understood that a Lincoln administration meant the death of slavery. </p>   
<p>However, their faith that fellow Kentuckians would come to see the error in neutrality never came to light. In fact, after Confederates forces occupied Hickman and Columbus in September of 1861, Kentucky forsook neutrality for support of the federal cause. Although a minority, Craig also gives equal time to pro-Unionists, and their complicated interactions with slavery and race in western Kentucky. Kentucky’s loyalty to the Union was always narrowly qualified: anti-Lincoln, white supremacist, and predicated on the preservation of slavery. Purchase Unionists, who by 1863 called themselves Union Democrats, were no different. They vehemently counseled their secessionist neighbors that rebellion had only furthered the cause of abolition by creating the circumstances for the hated Emancipation Proclamation and the subsequent recruitment of African-Americans into the Union army.  For Union Democrats, abolitionists and secessionists were evil twins, threatening the social order and democratic institutions valued by all white Kentuckians.  They saw no contradiction in fighting to restore a union in which slavery, for all intents and purposes, was on the route to extinction.  Ironically, by 1864, Purchase Unionists were using black troops to regain control of their communities and to combat Confederate guerillas, who were often their neighbors. Furthermore, black soldiers played a key role at the only major confrontation in the region, the Battle of Paducah in 1864, defending Fort Anderson from Nathan Bedford Forrest’s cavalry attack.  Also, Columbus served as an important recruiting camp for black enlistees and their families, second in activity to Jessamine County’s Camp Nelson. </p>      
 <p><i>Kentucky Confederates’</i> convincing thesis relies on a wide variety of sources, such as diaries, memoirs, travel accounts, and a copious number of newspapers, which Craig exhaustively mines to provide a nuanced political analysis. Studies of the Civil War in Kentucky usually provide little coverage of western Kentucky compared to either eastern Kentucky or the Bluegrass. The area’s history stands in deep contrast to the dominant paradigm of Kentucky as a loyal state that, as historian Merton E. Coulter famously noted in <i>The Civil War and Readjustment in Kentucky</i>, joined the Confederacy after the war. Undoubtedly, Craig’s book will change this trend in the historiography.  <i>Kentucky Confederates</i> clearly illustrates that western Kentucky was a cultural and political bellwether that the rest of the state followed postwar in assuming a Confederate identity. </p>
